after a less than stellar start , they 'll try to reverse their fortunes by picking the winners and losers correctly this week . match day five in the bundesliga is upon us , and the only ones doing worse than schalke are dw 's team of football freaks .
we pulled off a rare feat last time around and managed to get all the results wrong -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but winners never quit , and quitters never win .
so we 're back at it again for the midweek matches .
here 's goes nothing .
tuesday , september 21 mainz – cologne mainz are topping the table to everyone 's surprise and look like a very solid team with a variety of players who can score .
cologne are doing what they do best and eking enough points to stay just above the relegation zone .
the billy goats held bayern to a scoreless draw in the last round , and they should be able to do the same against mainz .
prediction : 0-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings and bremen will look to get a boot in against hanover hoffenheim – bayern munich hoffenheim are off to a fine start , while bayern have n't scored in their past three matches .
not having arjen robben is a big factor , of course , and ivica olic has yet to find last season 's form .
but no one 's panicking in munich yet , and we think bayern will find their range again on tuesday .
prediction : bayern 2-1 hanover – werder bremen after two wins and a draw , hanover reverted to their meek losing form last weekend , while bremen will be looking for redemption after losing to mainz at home .
both teams are suspect at the back so this could be a real goal-fest , which always favors bremen .
prediction : bremen 4-2 wednesday , september 22 leverkusen – frankfurt frankfurt have looked better than their 1-0-3 record while leverkusen will have to get used to life without stefan kiessling , whose ankle injury will sideline him for the foreseeable future .
put those two things together and what you come out with is a dull draw .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thins have been hunky-dory for the men in yellow dortmund – kaiserslautern dortmund 's main challenge in this match is to get their feet back on the ground after thrashing arch-rivals schalke away on sunday .
kaiserslautern are proving difficult to beat , but then again dortmund , with its huge crowds , is a very difficult place to play , especially for a newly promoted team .
prediction : dortmund 2-1 hamburg – wolfsburg intriguing , intriguing .
there 's was little to like about hamburg 's draw with st. pauli over the weekend – except for mladen petric 's stunning goal .
if petric gets into the line-up , the northern germans should be able to handle the wolves , who have yet to show they can beat a good team .
prediction : hamburg 2-1 moenchengladbach – st. pauli this is a crucial match for gladbach after the foals got hammered to the tune of 7-1 by previously winless stuttgart .
st. pauli should give their back four much more time to get sorted , and gladbach have proven they can score goals .
prediction : gladbach 2-0 freiburg – schalke speaking of teams facing must-win situations … schalke .
four games , zero points , and a team that 's yet to gel on the pitch is the sad summation of the royal blues campaign thus far .
meanwhile , freiburg are a surprising fourth in the table , albeit thanks to a couple of lucky results .
schalke have n't had enough time to get their house in order , but a point should be within reach .
prediction : 1-1 nuremberg – stuttgart nuremberg have drawn three of their first four , while stuttgart recovered from an awful start to put seven past gladbach last week .
the club will put up much sturdier resistance , but they may try too hard to get a first win in front of their home fans , which could open opportunities for the swabians .

here , close to the equator , the sun sets for most of the year at around 6 in the evening and only rises 12 hours later .
in south american capitals like lima and quito , the population switches the lights on as soon as twilight kicks in .
but that 's not an option in villages up in the andes , most of which are n't connected to electricity grids .
across the planet , 1.6 billion people lack access to electricity , most of them in remote regions , and therefore lead their lives according to the changing of the seasons , sunrise and sunset – a way people in europe and north america stopped living hundreds of years ago .
decentralizing energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-wind hybrid systems are gaining ground the only way to bring electricity to rural areas is to focus on the development of decentralized , renewable energies .
solar panels on the roofs of huts have become a common sight in many developing nations .
these days , micro wind turbines are also becoming increasingly common , capable of covering the energy needs of households and farmsteads as well as being user-friendly and carbon-neutral .
" mini wind turbines are an excellent opportunity for developing nations , " ulf gerder from the german wind energy association -lrb- bwe -rrb- said .
in mongolia , for example , they are often the only source of energy available to nomads .
they carry their super-small wind turbines on the back of their horses .
energy needed for economic progress a reliable energy supply is a prerequisite for economic development . the populations of poor countries often depend for their electricity on diesel generators and batteries , which are costly and environmentally damaging .
mini wind turbines , on the other hand , are an efficient solution in terms both of easing poverty and helping the environment .
an east african ngo called green africa certainly thinks so , and is aiming to make them more common , installing mini wind turbines in villages in countries such as kenya , burundi and rwanda .
" access to electricity has a positive effect on many areas of life , " green africa 's kefa rabah explained .
it allows people to recharge mobile phones , for example , without having to head into a nearby town , which might be many kilometers away .
and in africa , cell phones are often a vital means of communication .
rabah also stressed how much access to electricity improves educational opportunities .
" the children of a goat herd only come home after dark , for example , " he said . " if there is electricity in their home , they can then still spend a few hours reading and doing homework . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the west bank village of susya , locals use solar panels and wind turbines to illuminate their makeshift homes but in fact , mini wind turbines are gaining in popularity not only in developing countries and emerging economies .
in europe and north america , they are seen as an attractive source of sustainable energy , and moreover , as affordable thanks to state subsidies supporting renewable energy infrastructure .
let there be light however , a major drawback to mini wind turbines in germany is that while power generated by a photovoltaic system stored in the grid is worth between 24 and 42 cents per kilowatt-hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- , energy generated by wind power is worth just 9 cents .
" solar and wind power should n't compete , they should complement one another , " gerder from the bwe said . hybrid energy providers that combine solar and wind power are indeed already available .
the winds of change are already blowing in the region of cajamarca in the remote northern highlands of peru .
the ngo " soluciones practicas " has installed mini wind turbines that provide over 4,000 families with a daily supply of electricity amounting to an average 0.3 kilowatts per hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- .
moreover , the organization ensures that every village is home to at least one technician able to repair and maintain the technology . " soluciones practicas " has also set up a training center where young people from all over the world can learn about renewable energy and take their expertise home with them .
micro turbines do n't just provide clean energy , they also offer people in remote regions the chance to be connected to the world .
in peru , the technology has already brought light to some of the darkest corners of the country .

dw-world.de use of wind energy continues to soar around the world clean wind energy is increasing in popularity around the world .
some 82 countries already harness energy from the wind to power homes and towns .
but the technology is still in its infancy in developing nations .
-lrb- 01.06.2010 -rrb- turbines start spinning at germany 's first offshore wind park germany 's first off-shore wind farm has gone into operation tuesday with environment minister norbert roettgen officially starting the 12 turbines constructed in the north sea .
-lrb- 27.04.2010 -rrb- the answer to clean living may be blowing in the wind wind power currently meets eight percent of national energy needs .
much of that comes from huge turbines at wind farms , but experts are now predicting major growth in a diminutive version of the same thing .

the french interior minister says the country is facing a " real terrorist threat . " the security level in france has been heightened after receiving intelligence that there was a threat of a possible suicide attack .
the tip-off came from algerian intelligence services and the potential bomber was thought to be a woman targeting either the paris metro transport system or a public gathering place .
" the terrorism threat is real , we have increased our vigilance , " said interior minister brice hortefeux on monday , without giving any specific details .
the heightened alert follows last tuesday 's ban on the wearing of the islamic face veil in public and recent military action against suspected islamic militants in north africa .
niger kidnappings authorities have warned an attack was increasingly possible since july when french soldiers were involved in a raid on an al qaeda camp in mali .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security has been boosted in public after al qaeda threats the north african wing of al qaeda , or al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- have warned they will kill french citizens in revenge for fighters killed in the raid .
as a result of the french action , aqim assassinated a 78-year-old french engineer who they took hostage in niger .
in addition , five french nationals were kidnapped in niger last week , reportedly by aqim .
the head of france 's counter intelligence service , bernard squarcini , has appeared in several interviews recently evoking the heightened alert , telling le monde on sunday : " carrying out an attack on our territory is among their objectives . "
authorities have visibly boosted police and military units patrolling landmarks , including the eiffel tower , where 2,000 people were evacuated last week after a hoax bomb threat .

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .
the proposed code may make a law on the issue redundant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german interior minister hosted the one-day summit in berlin however , de maiziere recognized that such technology can be beneficial , and said he does not want to give people the right to delete images that can be viewed by the public anyway .
he does , however , want service providers to make it clearer how their privacy rights may be infringed by using particular services .
de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "
however , the interior minister wants to lay down a law to draw a " red line , " " which can not be crossed under any circumstances . "

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .
the proposed code may make a law on the issue redundant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german interior minister hosted the one-day summit in berlin however , de maiziere recognized that such technology can be beneficial , and said he does not want to give people the right to delete images that can be viewed by the public anyway .

de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "

after a less than stellar start , they 'll try to reverse their fortunes by picking the winners and losers correctly this week . match day five in the bundesliga is upon us , and the only ones doing worse than schalke are dw 's team of football freaks .
we pulled off a rare feat last time around and managed to get all the results wrong -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but winners never quit , and quitters never win .
so we 're back at it again for the midweek matches .
here 's goes nothing .
tuesday , september 21 mainz – cologne mainz are topping the table to everyone 's surprise and look like a very solid team with a variety of players who can score .
cologne are doing what they do best and eking enough points to stay just above the relegation zone .
the billy goats held bayern to a scoreless draw in the last round , and they should be able to do the same against mainz .
prediction : 0-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings and bremen will look to get a boot in against hanover hoffenheim – bayern munich hoffenheim are off to a fine start , while bayern have n't scored in their past three matches .
not having arjen robben is a big factor , of course , and ivica olic has yet to find last season 's form .
but no one 's panicking in munich yet , and we think bayern will find their range again on tuesday .
prediction : bayern 2-1 hanover – werder bremen after two wins and a draw , hanover reverted to their meek losing form last weekend , while bremen will be looking for redemption after losing to mainz at home .
both teams are suspect at the back so this could be a real goal-fest , which always favors bremen .
prediction : bremen 4-2 wednesday , september 22 leverkusen – frankfurt frankfurt have looked better than their 1-0-3 record while leverkusen will have to get used to life without stefan kiessling , whose ankle injury will sideline him for the foreseeable future .
put those two things together and what you come out with is a dull draw .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thins have been hunky-dory for the men in yellow dortmund – kaiserslautern dortmund 's main challenge in this match is to get their feet back on the ground after thrashing arch-rivals schalke away on sunday .
kaiserslautern are proving difficult to beat , but then again dortmund , with its huge crowds , is a very difficult place to play , especially for a newly promoted team .
prediction : dortmund 2-1 hamburg – wolfsburg intriguing , intriguing .
there 's was little to like about hamburg 's draw with st. pauli over the weekend – except for mladen petric 's stunning goal .
if petric gets into the line-up , the northern germans should be able to handle the wolves , who have yet to show they can beat a good team .
prediction : hamburg 2-1 moenchengladbach – st. pauli this is a crucial match for gladbach after the foals got hammered to the tune of 7-1 by previously winless stuttgart .
st. pauli should give their back four much more time to get sorted , and gladbach have proven they can score goals .
prediction : gladbach 2-0 freiburg – schalke speaking of teams facing must-win situations … schalke .
four games , zero points , and a team that 's yet to gel on the pitch is the sad summation of the royal blues campaign thus far .
meanwhile , freiburg are a surprising fourth in the table , albeit thanks to a couple of lucky results .
schalke have n't had enough time to get their house in order , but a point should be within reach .
prediction : 1-1 nuremberg – stuttgart nuremberg have drawn three of their first four , while stuttgart recovered from an awful start to put seven past gladbach last week .
the club will put up much sturdier resistance , but they may try too hard to get a first win in front of their home fans , which could open opportunities for the swabians .
prediction : stuttgart 2-1 and now for the really sad part … last week 's result : 0 points frankfurt - freiburg 0-1 -lrb- dw prediction : frankfurt 2-0 -rrb- bayern munich - cologne 0-0 -lrb- dw prediction : bayern 2-0 -rrb- werder bremen - mainz 0-2 -lrb- dw prediction : bremen 3-1 -rrb- stuttgart-moenchengladbach 7-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-1 -rrb- wolfsburg - hanover 2-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-2 -rrb- kaiserslautern - hoffenheim 2-2 -lrb- dw prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 -rrb- st. pauli - hamburg 1-1 -lrb- dw prediction : st. pauli 2-1 -rrb- dortmund - schalke 3-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-1 -rrb- leverkusen - nuremberg 0-0 -lrb- dw prediction : leverkusen 3-0 -rrb- total for the season : 15 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : jefferson chase editor : richard connor jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's new center-right government has vowed it will stand firm . police officers , firefighters , soldiers and nurses were among tens of thousands protesting in prague on tuesday over government plans to slash salaries .
between 25,000 and 30,000 people from across the czech republic took part in the protest , according to official police figures .
the demonstration , the country 's biggest labor protest of the past three years , brought traffic in some parts of the city to a halt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : necas says ' no circumstances ' will persuade him to back off " these ill-considered measures risk being translated into a deterioration of citizens ' security , " milan stepanek , head of the czech republic 's independent police union , said of the cuts .
government sticking to targets the country 's new center-right cabinet , headed by prime minister petr necas , has resolved to reduce the budget deficit from 5.3 percent of gross domestic product this year to 4.6 percent next year .
" i have said openly that the government will not back off , under any circumstances , " necas said in response to the demonstrations .
unions say they could accept a salary freeze , but they claim that imposing cuts of 10 percent for public sector employees is going too far .
the czech government hopes to restrict its borrowing to three percent of gdp by 2013 .
necas is pressing ahead with the cuts as part of austerity measures being adopted by governments with budget deficits across europe in the wake of the greek sovereign debt crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 21.09.2010 new right-wing parties face major obstacles in both germany and the us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little-known tea party candidate has rocked the republican establishment while the tea party is gaining strength in the us , some conservatives in germany question whether the ruling christian democrats are still conservative enough .
could new right-wing parties emerge in both countries ? the latest shock to the system came for the republican party in the name of christine o 'donnell .
her stunning victory over the establishment-backed candidate in the republican primary in the state of delaware catapulted the tea party activist from obscurity into the limelight .
on the same day , in the new york republican primary , a tea party supporter also beat the candidate favored by the party hierarchy .
their upsets , but also the growing public profile of a movement which has been supported by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin and right-wing talk-show host glenn beck , signal a possible realignment within the conservative political spectrum of the united states .
the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .
unlike most other advanced democracies , germany and the us so far have only one mainstream conservative party .
could that change now with a new right-wing party emerging in both countries ? economic loss while germany and the us share a segment of the electorate that is unhappy with the current situation and the political elite , the chances for a new party to the right of the center to profit from this malaise are vastly different , argue experts .
" what you have in these advanced industrial democracies is a general fear or sense of economic loss and i think this is very justified , " andrei markovits , professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , told deutsche welle .
" the response i may not agree with , but there is clearly a sense of that for the first time maybe the next generation will not be as well off as its parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tea party movement has been supported by fox news talk show host glenn beck however , below the surface of discontent with the conservative mainstream , the constituents of the tea party have a distinct background and motivation that sets them apart from the disenchanted conservatives in germany , notes thomas poguntke , professor for comparative politics at heinrich heine university in duesseldorf .
" i think the religious component of the tea party is a lot stronger than the religious component of the intra-conservative dissent in germany .
i would argue that the german debate within the christian democratic party has a lot to do with that the profile of the christian parties in germany has become a lot more unclear than it was in the past , " he told deutsche welle .
libertarian roots what 's more , says stephen silvia , a comparative politics expert at american university in washington d.c. , " the tea party is a party that is fundamentally a libertarian party .
and when one looks at the german political landscape the party that is ideologically closest to the tea party is not the cdu , but the -lrb- free market-oriented liberal party - ed . -rrb-
fdp . "
while it appears at the moment that the tea party movement stands a much better chance than the disenfranchized german conservatives of having a concrete impact on politics and policies , the likelihood of the tea party becoming a unique political force in the us is next to none .
" in the anglo-american so-called first-past-the-post system it is very difficult to create a successful third party , " says markovits .
" in fact the american history is littered with the graveyard of so-called third parties . "
poguntke concurs that the us two-party system is so strongly entrenched in the way the political system works that the only viable option for dissenting voices is to work through the existing parties .
he adds : " what the tea party movement is about is changing the republican party , pulling it further to the right . "
" it seems to me that the republican party has a very serious issue on its hands , because it basically played with fire , " says markovits .
" they are really the sorceror 's apprentice in that they played with it and then this suddenly became big and endangered the party itself . "
hurdles for new right-wing party in germany due to germany 's electoral system of proportional representation , the structural hurdles for establishing a new party are lower as the rise of the greens and left party has indicated .
but none of the experts interviewed by deutsche welle predicts the emergence of a national party right of the cdu in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the cdu is devoid of conservative voices the switch from a successful movement to a successful party is very difficult , says markovits .
" it 's a totally different gig .
movements can talk , movements have phenomenal voice options , whether they have the same deed options in a very complex parliamentarian system is a completely different story .
if you want to be a player , that 's a very tall order . "
what 's more , says poguntke , " there also is a stronger taboo to mobilize on the right in germany as in most other european countries due to our nazi past . "
in addition , he adds , until now the conservative parties in germany have always been very clever to cover their right-wing flank .
" i think to a certain degree this debate in germany is based on the partially false assumption that there is a huge electorate which is structurally very conservative , " says poguntke . there certainly are conservatives who do n't feel at home in the cdu anymore , he contends . " but this portion of the population is not as big as it used to be . "
for all those reasons , the experts view the battle over the soul of the republican party as the more interesting intra-conservative rumblings .
" the only chance is for the republicans to walk this fine tight rope that they have to moderate and also try to keep these guys , " says markovits .
" whether they can do it , i actually doubt very much because at the moment i do n't see a major republican leader who could do it .
ronald reagan could have . "

merkel said that more conditions should be attached to aid to ensure effective results . chancellor angela merkel has called for the governments of developing nations to take more responsibility in fighting poverty .
the chancellor also said that developed nations should attach tighter conditions to the money they lend and argued in favor of linking the amount to results already achieved .
she said that countries should not rely indefinitely on handouts and had to take charge of their own development . she added social progress was " unthinkable " without good governance and human rights .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit has brought together some 140 world leaders " there is one thing we have to accept , " said merkel .
" the primary responsibility for development lies with the governments of the developing countries .
it is in their hands whether aid can be effective .
therefore , support for good governance is as important as aid itself . "
merkel made her comments at the un general assembly 's special session on the millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- in new york on tuesday , an event attended by some 140 heads of state or government .
they are reviewing the progress of the mdgs agreed 10 years ago to cut poverty , and improve gender quality , health and education .
aid should be used more effectively firm conditions to ensure that money was spent in an effective way should be applied , according to the chancellor .
" development aid can not continue indefinitely .
the task is to use limited resources as effectively as possible . "
" we have to put results-based development aid at center stage , " merkel said .
" it should just only be about money but also about what comes of that money . "
the chancellor added lasting progress on development would require the world to successfully address challenges in four fields - peace and security , poverty reduction , environmental protection and promotion of human rights and good governance .
germany is the third biggest contributor to the un budget and it is one of the largest development aid donors .
potential for german seat on the security council the chancellor is keen for germany to become a non-permanent member of the influential un security council .
she claimed on tuesday that she had received " a lot of support and encouragment " for germany 's bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is hoping germany will get a seat on the un security council a seat on the un 's peacekeeping council would allow germany to " present its views more strongly . "
the new non-permanent members will be elected by the general assemby in october .
however , the aid organization oxfam expressed disappointment in merkel 's speech .
" we expected much more from the german contribution , " oxfam spokeswoman emma seery commented after the speech .
" germany did not say how it will keep its promises to help poorer countries . "
helping women help themselves many experts are concerned that a number of the mdgs on poverty are unlikely to be achieved by the 2015 deadline .
several speakers at the meeting said the goals would not be achieved unless more is done to improve the lives of poor women .
liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf , africa 's first female head of state , called for more investment in sectors that help women , including agriculture and small businesses .
" as we renew our resolve in the year 2010 , we must recognize the need for inclusive economic growth , " she said .
the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , announced that 1 billion euros -lrb- 1.3 billion dollars -rrb- would be given to help africa , the caribbean and pacific countries lagging behind their mdgs .
barroso urged other donors not to use the economic crisis as an excuse to shirk their responsibilities to the poor .
" the international community still has a long way to go before the millennium goals are reached , " he said .

the french interior minister says the country is facing a " real terrorist threat . " the security level in france has been heightened after receiving intelligence that there was a threat of a possible suicide attack .
the tip-off came from algerian intelligence services and the potential bomber was thought to be a woman targeting either the paris metro transport system or a public gathering place .
" the terrorism threat is real , we have increased our vigilance , " said interior minister brice hortefeux on monday , without giving any specific details .
the heightened alert follows last tuesday 's ban on the wearing of the islamic face veil in public and recent military action against suspected islamic militants in north africa .
niger kidnappings authorities have warned an attack was increasingly possible since july when french soldiers were involved in a raid on an al qaeda camp in mali .

as a result of the french action , aqim assassinated a 78-year-old french engineer who they took hostage in niger .
in addition , five french nationals were kidnapped in niger last week , reportedly by aqim .
the head of france 's counter intelligence service , bernard squarcini , has appeared in several interviews recently evoking the heightened alert , telling le monde on sunday : " carrying out an attack on our territory is among their objectives . "
authorities have visibly boosted police and military units patrolling landmarks , including the eiffel tower , where 2,000 people were evacuated last week after a hoax bomb threat .

the french interior minister says the country is facing a " real terrorist threat . " the security level in france has been heightened after receiving intelligence that there was a threat of a possible suicide attack .
the tip-off came from algerian intelligence services and the potential bomber was thought to be a woman targeting either the paris metro transport system or a public gathering place .
" the terrorism threat is real , we have increased our vigilance , " said interior minister brice hortefeux on monday , without giving any specific details .
the heightened alert follows last tuesday 's ban on the wearing of the islamic face veil in public and recent military action against suspected islamic militants in north africa .
niger kidnappings authorities have warned an attack was increasingly possible since july when french soldiers were involved in a raid on an al qaeda camp in mali .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security has been boosted in public after al qaeda threats the north african wing of al qaeda , or al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- have warned they will kill french citizens in revenge for fighters killed in the raid .
as a result of the french action , aqim assassinated a 78-year-old french engineer who they took hostage in niger .
in addition , five french nationals were kidnapped in niger last week , reportedly by aqim .
the head of france 's counter intelligence service , bernard squarcini , has appeared in several interviews recently evoking the heightened alert , telling le monde on sunday : " carrying out an attack on our territory is among their objectives . "
authorities have visibly boosted police and military units patrolling landmarks , including the eiffel tower , where 2,000 people were evacuated last week after a hoax bomb threat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 21.09.2010 germany launches campaign for sexual abuse victims to speak out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign tells victims that talking can heal mental wounds in response to the child abuse scandal in the catholic church , thousands of german victims are being targeted by a new campaign that aims to end their silent suffering .
the message is that talking helps . in response to cases of child abuse within the jesuit order in germany earlier this year , the government in march established the post of an independent commissioner and also set up a telephone hotline for victims to speak about their suffering and seek help .
since then , about 2,500 germans have made contact with her office , said commissioner christine bergmann , adding " some 60 percent of them have never previously talked about what happened to them " .
on average , the victims were now " in their 50s " , she said , with the abuse having taken place " mostly some 20 , or sometimes even 40 or 50 years ago . "
clerical culprits almost 50 percent of sex abuse cases reported took place in german institutions , primarily in the roman catholic church , as well as on a lesser scale in sports clubs and at schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at berlin 's canisius college , run by jesuits , first cases of abuse were reported in january 2010 some 34 percent of the callers claimed to have been abused within their own families or by acquaintances .
" while the perpetrators were more than 80 percent male , it was surprising to see that almost as many men as women were victims of sexual abuse " , said joerg fegert , director of the ulm university clinic , who heads the team analysing the calls .
clear message fegert said the figures his team compiled with the prior consent of the victims were " far from representative for the entire german population " .
nevertheless the message the victims wanted to send to the general public was " very clear " .
" they believe it 's important to have someone who finally listens to them and believes what they say , " he said .
" compensation is also an issue because it would mean that the victims ' suffering is officially acknowledged . "
a key demand for politics was to make sure that a statute of limitations on sexual abuse was completely abolished , fegert said , because victims ' suffering did n't end after a certain time limit .
raising public awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a telephone hotline has been set up for victims independent commissioner christine bergmann on tuesday also launched a public campaign aimed at ending " decades of ignorance about the issue of sexual abuse in germany " .
a special internet website , as well as newspaper and television advertisements , are intended to publicise the abuse telephone hotline , so that many more victims can " break out of their isolation " .
german filmmaker wim wenders produced a special tv spot entitled : " breaking the silence breaks the power of the perpetrator " .
" ignoring bad things has a long tradition in germany " , wenders said , " but this ignorance perpetuates the trauma and must be ended to prevent cases of sexual abuse from happening again . "
experts ' roundtable round-table talks organized by the german government are scheduled to be held in november to discuss legal issues concerning sexual abuse , as well as medical and financial aid for the victims .
a group of victims who were sexually abused by members of the catholic jesuit order said on monday they would seek compensation payments of more than 80,000 euros -lrb- $ 105,000 -rrb- for each of the 205 victims .

a festival in berlin is keen to keep its memory alive . ninety years after its release in berlin , the film " the cabinet of dr. caligari " is still recognized as having kick-started expressionist cinema , launched horror as a viable film genre , and introduced new narrative concepts such as flashbacks and twist endings .
it was a major influence on directors such as fritz lang and alfred hitchcock , who adopted caligari 's inventive and atmospheric use of light and shadow . now , the film has inspired its first festival , called somnambule .
held in weissensee - the same berlin neighborhood where the film was originally shot - the somnambule festival featured 10 days of film screenings , dance performances and exhibitions , all dedicated to the memory of a german masterpiece . history of a ' milestone ' " it wouldn ’ t be an exaggeration to describe this film as a milestone , " said nils foerster , the program director at the brotfabrik arts and culture center , where the festival was held .
" its influence can still be seen in film and art to this day . " " the cabinet of dr. caligari " was written by hans janowitz and carl mayer , who met in berlin just after world war i. they were fans of the then rapidly developing wave of expressionist art , and thought film could be a new platform for the style .
the pair decided to develop a horror story - a genre well-suited to the macabre and disorienting direction they visualized for their film .
they approached legendary producer erich pommer , then head of the decla-biscop studio .
he bought their script idea on the spot and agreed to produce the film in an avant-garde , expressionist style .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festival aims to be an annual event after director fritz lang initially turned the project down , robert wiene was assigned to direct the film in 1919 - although lang still had an influence on the film .
it was he who suggested bookending the main story with scenes set in a normal garden , creating a stark contrast to the bizarre , off-kilter world in which the film 's main narrative takes place . a film full of ' firsts ' much has been written about caligari 's novel use of artistic design ; the dizzying dreamworld at the heart of the film was created by hermann warm and set decorators walter reihmann and walter roehrig .
their use of skewed , paper sets which played with perspective , and had shadows painted directly onto them , was absolutely novel . producer pommer was wary at first , but after seeing test scenes , he was won over and gave his team free reign to produce the film as they saw fit . bildunterschrift : atmospheric lighting , distorted set design and exaggerated make-up combine to create a bizarre dreamworld the story was also one of the first in cinema to be told in flashback .
it concerns the villainous dr. caligari , played by werner krauss .
krauss was one of germany ’ s most highly-respected actors at the time , but his career was later tainted after he appeared in the 1940 nazi propaganda film " jud suess . "
a young conrad veidt was cast as caesare , caligari 's murderous accomplice , a somnambulist - or sleepwalker - who stalks the streets at night murdering young women .
actress lil dagover played jane , the sleeping beauty kidnapped by caesare . as if the novel set design and flashback framing device were n't revolutionary enough , the film is also credited with being the first in cinema history to introduce a twist-ending .
at the film 's conclusion it transpires that the events related by narrator fancis to his friend alan are not true at all : francis , jane and caesare are all inmates of a lunatic asylum , with caligari the asylum 's chief medical officer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somnambule patterned its logo on expressionist art " the cabinet of dr. caligari " went into production at the lixie-atelier in weissensee , just a few blocks from where the brotfabrik stands today - making it an utterly appropriate place to hold the somnambule festival , according to the brotfabrik 's foerster . . " wiessensee was the heart of the german film industry in the 1920s , " foerster said .
" nobody knows this anymore . " the film premiered at the marmorhaus cinema in berlin on february 26 , 1920 .
it was an immediate hit with critics and at the box office at home and abroad - and its influence is still felt in art world . " in our film program , there were movies from 1924 to 2010 , all of which were directly or indirectly influenced by ' the cabinet of dr. caligari . " ' said foerster .
" it was a trend-setter in the formative years of cinema , and the rules of set design and film language which it created are still valid to this day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 21.09.2010 the rise of the far-right in the east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis gained ground in the east after the fall of the wall along with many other prejudices , eastern germany has had to contend with a reputation for neo-nazism .
it 's not entirely unjustified , but right-wing extremism in the east has roots in economic hardship . right-wing violence was most dramatic in the first years of the newly unified germany - and more and more often , they occurred in the former east germany .
for three consecutive nights in august 1992 , several hundred neo-nazis - watched by up to 2,000 locals - attacked an apartment block for asylum seekers in the north-eastern town of rostock .
with the police unprepared and initially outnumbered , the violence continued unchecked until it culminated in an arson attack .
the rostock riots quickly achieved international notoriety .
pictures of drunken , violent east germans doing hitler salutes were printed around the world .
this was not the dawn of a new , hopeful country that had been celebrated less than two years before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1992 arson attack on an asylum shelter in rostock became infamous authority vacuum neo-nazi violence was not just a stain on the former east germany .
over 100 of the 370 rioters arrested in rostock had travelled from the former west , where there was a string of horrific attacks on turkish immigrants in the early nineties .
but rostock cemented the reputation of post-wall eastern germany as a new haven for neo-nazism , and that reputation stuck .
what characterized the rostock riots as specifically east german was the powerlessness of the authorities . for two or three years after the fall of the wall , state institutions in the former german democratic republic were weakened by the period of transition .
police officers suddenly found themselves associated with a discredited regime .
dierk borstel , a researcher into right-wing extremism at the university of bielefeld , described the precarious circumstances in the early 1990s as linked to a lack of functioning insitutions .
" the police force was destabilized and the church had little influence anyway , " borstel told deutsche welle .
" the eastern german trade unions and the pds , the successor party to the former ruling communist sed , had little authority , and the trade unions and industry associations coming in from the west were all very weak in the east . "
worst of many worlds these semi-anarchic conditions were fertile ground for far-right activists in the former east germany , and their cause was further helped by the disappointment and poverty that spread in the east after reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd has scored some electoral success in the last six years " the expectation of east germans after reunification was : ' we 're going to get the security of the east plus the freedoms of the west , " ' borstel says .
" the result was that they lost the securities and could n't afford the freedoms . "
even though the skinhead neo-nazi scene originated in western europe , it already existed in east germany before the fall of the iron curtain .
it was often linked to certain football teams , and occasionally broke out in extreme violence , such as the attack of 30 skinheads on a concert in a church in central east berlin in 1987 .
the far-right movement in the east capitalized on what many describe as the gdr 's denial of its own nazi history .
olaf sundermeyer , author of " in the npd , " a book about the development of germany 's populist far-right national democratic party , believes the gdr 's distanced attitude to hitler 's germany helped feed the neo-nazi movement .
" communist leaders in the gdr said , ' we are an anti-fascist state and we have no responsibility for history .
there are no nazis here . '
of course that was n't true .
there were former nazis in both east and west germany , but there was no denazification in east germany - the nazi history was not dealt with , " he said .
imbalance and injustice east german society was never particularly multicultural , and the government 's immigration policies showed a determination to keep the population monotone .
immigrant workers from other socialist countries like mozambique were sent home if they got pregnant , or as soon as their allotted time ran out .
the lack of a multicultural foundation is still reflected in eastern german society today .
" eastern germany has a lot fewer immigrants - and it has long been acknowledged that where there are no immigrants and no jews , there is more racism and anti-semitism , " borstel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has caused unrest in the former gdr neo-nazis were also able to win over some east germans with familiar ideas .
" national socialism often starts out with the idea of socialism , and then that is combined with frustration , unemployment , lack of opportunity , and populations moving away . "
this is the opinion of a former neo-nazi who wants to remain anonymous , working for exit deutschland , an organization that helps people leave the far-right scene .
there is a widespread feeling that the west left the east behind economically .
in the last 20 years , unemployment in the former east has been consistently twice as high as in the west , and the emigration of young eastern germans remains a problem .
statistical evidence shows that german far-right parties tend to prosper in times of economic depression , and the npd has aimed its electoral resources aggressively at the most neglected districts .
the exit deutschland representative , who has counseled numerous former neo-nazis , said that the frustration that comes from being left behind after watching friends leave your home town is a factor common to many of those who turn to right-wing extremism .
" those who stay , for whatever reason - because they ca n't find a job anywhere else , for example - feel an enormous frustration .
that is fertile ground for far-right groups - and for extremist groups in general , " he said .
sympathy for the left this growing eastern german sympathy with the far-right chimed in with a study completed in 2003 , which found that 16 percent of germans had an extreme right-wing world-view - that is , they expressed chauvinistic , anti-semitic , social-darwinist or xenophobic opinions , and tended to trivialize the nazi regime .
in the east , this world-view was found in 23 percent of the population , compared to 14 percent in the west .
this showed a marked change from the early 1990s , when a similar study found far-right-wing opinion more prevalent in the west .
statisticians have linked this switch to a decline in economic expectation .
whereas easterners were more optimistic about their economic prospects in the early 1990s , by the late 1990s , westerners had become more positive about the economy .
behind this turnaround lay a real sense of betrayal .
in a study written in 2005 , political scientist richard stoess wrote , " that the eastern german people overtook their western compatriots in sympathy for right-wing extremism lay in the fact that their initial trust in the western system of democracy and market economy had turned into particularly bitter disappointment . "
neo-nazis for the new century as state authority began to re-assert itself in the east , the far-right developed more subtle ways to organize .
" the structures have become smaller , " said borstel .
" they no longer rely on large parties like the npd , but rather local cells , which are more difficult for the state to break up .
they have become anchored in local communities in a way i thought would never happen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far-right has reinvented itself for the new century this assimilation was mirrored in the far-right political parties , which have spent the past decade making themselves electable in the east .
although the npd have steadily lost ground in the former west , in the east they have gained a foothold in several state parliaments .
" the big bang was the state election of 2004 in saxony , where the npd first gained representation in an eastern german state parliament , " said sundermeyer .
" since then it has very gradually established itself as a ' normal ' party . "
the npd was re-elected to the saxony parliament in 2009 , with 5.6 percent of the vote .
the npd 's membership figures had risen from 4,000 in 1995 to 6,800 in 2009 .
the npd has achieved this success by aiming its messages at young people , especially via the internet , and appealing to sentiments shared by the far-left - anti-americanism , anti-israel , anti-globalization .
it has worked to pick up the youth protest vote , targeting sub-cultures with an anti-system stance . author : ben knight editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 21.09.2010 new right-wing parties face major obstacles in both germany and the us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little-known tea party candidate has rocked the republican establishment while the tea party is gaining strength in the us , some conservatives in germany question whether the ruling christian democrats are still conservative enough .
could new right-wing parties emerge in both countries ? the latest shock to the system came for the republican party in the name of christine o 'donnell .
her stunning victory over the establishment-backed candidate in the republican primary in the state of delaware catapulted the tea party activist from obscurity into the limelight .
on the same day , in the new york republican primary , a tea party supporter also beat the candidate favored by the party hierarchy .
their upsets , but also the growing public profile of a movement which has been supported by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin and right-wing talk-show host glenn beck , signal a possible realignment within the conservative political spectrum of the united states .
the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .
unlike most other advanced democracies , germany and the us so far have only one mainstream conservative party .
could that change now with a new right-wing party emerging in both countries ? economic loss while germany and the us share a segment of the electorate that is unhappy with the current situation and the political elite , the chances for a new party to the right of the center to profit from this malaise are vastly different , argue experts .
" what you have in these advanced industrial democracies is a general fear or sense of economic loss and i think this is very justified , " andrei markovits , professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , told deutsche welle .
" the response i may not agree with , but there is clearly a sense of that for the first time maybe the next generation will not be as well off as its parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tea party movement has been supported by fox news talk show host glenn beck however , below the surface of discontent with the conservative mainstream , the constituents of the tea party have a distinct background and motivation that sets them apart from the disenchanted conservatives in germany , notes thomas poguntke , professor for comparative politics at heinrich heine university in duesseldorf .
" i think the religious component of the tea party is a lot stronger than the religious component of the intra-conservative dissent in germany .
i would argue that the german debate within the christian democratic party has a lot to do with that the profile of the christian parties in germany has become a lot more unclear than it was in the past , " he told deutsche welle .
libertarian roots what 's more , says stephen silvia , a comparative politics expert at american university in washington d.c. , " the tea party is a party that is fundamentally a libertarian party .
and when one looks at the german political landscape the party that is ideologically closest to the tea party is not the cdu , but the -lrb- free market-oriented liberal party - ed . -rrb-
fdp . "
while it appears at the moment that the tea party movement stands a much better chance than the disenfranchized german conservatives of having a concrete impact on politics and policies , the likelihood of the tea party becoming a unique political force in the us is next to none .
" in the anglo-american so-called first-past-the-post system it is very difficult to create a successful third party , " says markovits .
" in fact the american history is littered with the graveyard of so-called third parties . "
poguntke concurs that the us two-party system is so strongly entrenched in the way the political system works that the only viable option for dissenting voices is to work through the existing parties .
he adds : " what the tea party movement is about is changing the republican party , pulling it further to the right . "
" it seems to me that the republican party has a very serious issue on its hands , because it basically played with fire , " says markovits .
" they are really the sorceror 's apprentice in that they played with it and then this suddenly became big and endangered the party itself . "
hurdles for new right-wing party in germany due to germany 's electoral system of proportional representation , the structural hurdles for establishing a new party are lower as the rise of the greens and left party has indicated .
but none of the experts interviewed by deutsche welle predicts the emergence of a national party right of the cdu in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the cdu is devoid of conservative voices the switch from a successful movement to a successful party is very difficult , says markovits .
" it 's a totally different gig .
movements can talk , movements have phenomenal voice options , whether they have the same deed options in a very complex parliamentarian system is a completely different story .
if you want to be a player , that 's a very tall order . "
what 's more , says poguntke , " there also is a stronger taboo to mobilize on the right in germany as in most other european countries due to our nazi past . "
in addition , he adds , until now the conservative parties in germany have always been very clever to cover their right-wing flank .
" i think to a certain degree this debate in germany is based on the partially false assumption that there is a huge electorate which is structurally very conservative , " says poguntke . there certainly are conservatives who do n't feel at home in the cdu anymore , he contends . " but this portion of the population is not as big as it used to be . "
for all those reasons , the experts view the battle over the soul of the republican party as the more interesting intra-conservative rumblings .
" the only chance is for the republicans to walk this fine tight rope that they have to moderate and also try to keep these guys , " says markovits .
" whether they can do it , i actually doubt very much because at the moment i do n't see a major republican leader who could do it .
ronald reagan could have . "

here , close to the equator , the sun sets for most of the year at around 6 in the evening and only rises 12 hours later .
in south american capitals like lima and quito , the population switches the lights on as soon as twilight kicks in .
but that 's not an option in villages up in the andes , most of which are n't connected to electricity grids .
across the planet , 1.6 billion people lack access to electricity , most of them in remote regions , and therefore lead their lives according to the changing of the seasons , sunrise and sunset – a way people in europe and north america stopped living hundreds of years ago .
decentralizing energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-wind hybrid systems are gaining ground the only way to bring electricity to rural areas is to focus on the development of decentralized , renewable energies .
solar panels on the roofs of huts have become a common sight in many developing nations .
these days , micro wind turbines are also becoming increasingly common , capable of covering the energy needs of households and farmsteads as well as being user-friendly and carbon-neutral .
" mini wind turbines are an excellent opportunity for developing nations , " ulf gerder from the german wind energy association -lrb- bwe -rrb- said .
in mongolia , for example , they are often the only source of energy available to nomads .
they carry their super-small wind turbines on the back of their horses .
energy needed for economic progress a reliable energy supply is a prerequisite for economic development . the populations of poor countries often depend for their electricity on diesel generators and batteries , which are costly and environmentally damaging .
mini wind turbines , on the other hand , are an efficient solution in terms both of easing poverty and helping the environment .
an east african ngo called green africa certainly thinks so , and is aiming to make them more common , installing mini wind turbines in villages in countries such as kenya , burundi and rwanda .
" access to electricity has a positive effect on many areas of life , " green africa 's kefa rabah explained .
it allows people to recharge mobile phones , for example , without having to head into a nearby town , which might be many kilometers away .
and in africa , cell phones are often a vital means of communication .
rabah also stressed how much access to electricity improves educational opportunities .
" the children of a goat herd only come home after dark , for example , " he said . " if there is electricity in their home , they can then still spend a few hours reading and doing homework . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the west bank village of susya , locals use solar panels and wind turbines to illuminate their makeshift homes but in fact , mini wind turbines are gaining in popularity not only in developing countries and emerging economies .
in europe and north america , they are seen as an attractive source of sustainable energy , and moreover , as affordable thanks to state subsidies supporting renewable energy infrastructure .
let there be light however , a major drawback to mini wind turbines in germany is that while power generated by a photovoltaic system stored in the grid is worth between 24 and 42 cents per kilowatt-hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- , energy generated by wind power is worth just 9 cents .

here , close to the equator , the sun sets for most of the year at around 6 in the evening and only rises 12 hours later .
in south american capitals like lima and quito , the population switches the lights on as soon as twilight kicks in .
but that 's not an option in villages up in the andes , most of which are n't connected to electricity grids .
across the planet , 1.6 billion people lack access to electricity , most of them in remote regions , and therefore lead their lives according to the changing of the seasons , sunrise and sunset – a way people in europe and north america stopped living hundreds of years ago .
decentralizing energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-wind hybrid systems are gaining ground the only way to bring electricity to rural areas is to focus on the development of decentralized , renewable energies .
solar panels on the roofs of huts have become a common sight in many developing nations .
these days , micro wind turbines are also becoming increasingly common , capable of covering the energy needs of households and farmsteads as well as being user-friendly and carbon-neutral .
" mini wind turbines are an excellent opportunity for developing nations , " ulf gerder from the german wind energy association -lrb- bwe -rrb- said .
in mongolia , for example , they are often the only source of energy available to nomads .
they carry their super-small wind turbines on the back of their horses .
energy needed for economic progress a reliable energy supply is a prerequisite for economic development . the populations of poor countries often depend for their electricity on diesel generators and batteries , which are costly and environmentally damaging .
mini wind turbines , on the other hand , are an efficient solution in terms both of easing poverty and helping the environment .
an east african ngo called green africa certainly thinks so , and is aiming to make them more common , installing mini wind turbines in villages in countries such as kenya , burundi and rwanda .
" access to electricity has a positive effect on many areas of life , " green africa 's kefa rabah explained .
it allows people to recharge mobile phones , for example , without having to head into a nearby town , which might be many kilometers away .
and in africa , cell phones are often a vital means of communication .
rabah also stressed how much access to electricity improves educational opportunities .
" the children of a goat herd only come home after dark , for example , " he said . " if there is electricity in their home , they can then still spend a few hours reading and doing homework . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the west bank village of susya , locals use solar panels and wind turbines to illuminate their makeshift homes but in fact , mini wind turbines are gaining in popularity not only in developing countries and emerging economies .
in europe and north america , they are seen as an attractive source of sustainable energy , and moreover , as affordable thanks to state subsidies supporting renewable energy infrastructure .
let there be light however , a major drawback to mini wind turbines in germany is that while power generated by a photovoltaic system stored in the grid is worth between 24 and 42 cents per kilowatt-hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- , energy generated by wind power is worth just 9 cents .
" solar and wind power should n't compete , they should complement one another , " gerder from the bwe said . hybrid energy providers that combine solar and wind power are indeed already available .
the winds of change are already blowing in the region of cajamarca in the remote northern highlands of peru .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 21.09.2010 new right-wing parties face major obstacles in both germany and the us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little-known tea party candidate has rocked the republican establishment while the tea party is gaining strength in the us , some conservatives in germany question whether the ruling christian democrats are still conservative enough .
could new right-wing parties emerge in both countries ? the latest shock to the system came for the republican party in the name of christine o 'donnell .
her stunning victory over the establishment-backed candidate in the republican primary in the state of delaware catapulted the tea party activist from obscurity into the limelight .
on the same day , in the new york republican primary , a tea party supporter also beat the candidate favored by the party hierarchy .
their upsets , but also the growing public profile of a movement which has been supported by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin and right-wing talk-show host glenn beck , signal a possible realignment within the conservative political spectrum of the united states .
the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .
unlike most other advanced democracies , germany and the us so far have only one mainstream conservative party .
could that change now with a new right-wing party emerging in both countries ? economic loss while germany and the us share a segment of the electorate that is unhappy with the current situation and the political elite , the chances for a new party to the right of the center to profit from this malaise are vastly different , argue experts .
" what you have in these advanced industrial democracies is a general fear or sense of economic loss and i think this is very justified , " andrei markovits , professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , told deutsche welle .
" the response i may not agree with , but there is clearly a sense of that for the first time maybe the next generation will not be as well off as its parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tea party movement has been supported by fox news talk show host glenn beck however , below the surface of discontent with the conservative mainstream , the constituents of the tea party have a distinct background and motivation that sets them apart from the disenchanted conservatives in germany , notes thomas poguntke , professor for comparative politics at heinrich heine university in duesseldorf .
" i think the religious component of the tea party is a lot stronger than the religious component of the intra-conservative dissent in germany .
i would argue that the german debate within the christian democratic party has a lot to do with that the profile of the christian parties in germany has become a lot more unclear than it was in the past , " he told deutsche welle .
libertarian roots what 's more , says stephen silvia , a comparative politics expert at american university in washington d.c. , " the tea party is a party that is fundamentally a libertarian party .
and when one looks at the german political landscape the party that is ideologically closest to the tea party is not the cdu , but the -lrb- free market-oriented liberal party - ed . -rrb-
fdp . "
while it appears at the moment that the tea party movement stands a much better chance than the disenfranchized german conservatives of having a concrete impact on politics and policies , the likelihood of the tea party becoming a unique political force in the us is next to none .
" in the anglo-american so-called first-past-the-post system it is very difficult to create a successful third party , " says markovits .
" in fact the american history is littered with the graveyard of so-called third parties . "
poguntke concurs that the us two-party system is so strongly entrenched in the way the political system works that the only viable option for dissenting voices is to work through the existing parties .
he adds : " what the tea party movement is about is changing the republican party , pulling it further to the right . "
" it seems to me that the republican party has a very serious issue on its hands , because it basically played with fire , " says markovits .
" they are really the sorceror 's apprentice in that they played with it and then this suddenly became big and endangered the party itself . "
hurdles for new right-wing party in germany due to germany 's electoral system of proportional representation , the structural hurdles for establishing a new party are lower as the rise of the greens and left party has indicated .
but none of the experts interviewed by deutsche welle predicts the emergence of a national party right of the cdu in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the cdu is devoid of conservative voices the switch from a successful movement to a successful party is very difficult , says markovits .
" it 's a totally different gig .
movements can talk , movements have phenomenal voice options , whether they have the same deed options in a very complex parliamentarian system is a completely different story .
if you want to be a player , that 's a very tall order . "
what 's more , says poguntke , " there also is a stronger taboo to mobilize on the right in germany as in most other european countries due to our nazi past . "
in addition , he adds , until now the conservative parties in germany have always been very clever to cover their right-wing flank .
" i think to a certain degree this debate in germany is based on the partially false assumption that there is a huge electorate which is structurally very conservative , " says poguntke . there certainly are conservatives who do n't feel at home in the cdu anymore , he contends . " but this portion of the population is not as big as it used to be . "
for all those reasons , the experts view the battle over the soul of the republican party as the more interesting intra-conservative rumblings .
" the only chance is for the republicans to walk this fine tight rope that they have to moderate and also try to keep these guys , " says markovits .
" whether they can do it , i actually doubt very much because at the moment i do n't see a major republican leader who could do it .
ronald reagan could have . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 21.09.2010 the rise of the far-right in the east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis gained ground in the east after the fall of the wall along with many other prejudices , eastern germany has had to contend with a reputation for neo-nazism .
it 's not entirely unjustified , but right-wing extremism in the east has roots in economic hardship . right-wing violence was most dramatic in the first years of the newly unified germany - and more and more often , they occurred in the former east germany .
for three consecutive nights in august 1992 , several hundred neo-nazis - watched by up to 2,000 locals - attacked an apartment block for asylum seekers in the north-eastern town of rostock .
with the police unprepared and initially outnumbered , the violence continued unchecked until it culminated in an arson attack .
the rostock riots quickly achieved international notoriety .
pictures of drunken , violent east germans doing hitler salutes were printed around the world .
this was not the dawn of a new , hopeful country that had been celebrated less than two years before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1992 arson attack on an asylum shelter in rostock became infamous authority vacuum neo-nazi violence was not just a stain on the former east germany .
over 100 of the 370 rioters arrested in rostock had travelled from the former west , where there was a string of horrific attacks on turkish immigrants in the early nineties .
but rostock cemented the reputation of post-wall eastern germany as a new haven for neo-nazism , and that reputation stuck .
what characterized the rostock riots as specifically east german was the powerlessness of the authorities . for two or three years after the fall of the wall , state institutions in the former german democratic republic were weakened by the period of transition .
police officers suddenly found themselves associated with a discredited regime .
dierk borstel , a researcher into right-wing extremism at the university of bielefeld , described the precarious circumstances in the early 1990s as linked to a lack of functioning insitutions .
" the police force was destabilized and the church had little influence anyway , " borstel told deutsche welle .
" the eastern german trade unions and the pds , the successor party to the former ruling communist sed , had little authority , and the trade unions and industry associations coming in from the west were all very weak in the east . "
worst of many worlds these semi-anarchic conditions were fertile ground for far-right activists in the former east germany , and their cause was further helped by the disappointment and poverty that spread in the east after reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd has scored some electoral success in the last six years " the expectation of east germans after reunification was : ' we 're going to get the security of the east plus the freedoms of the west , " ' borstel says .
" the result was that they lost the securities and could n't afford the freedoms . "
even though the skinhead neo-nazi scene originated in western europe , it already existed in east germany before the fall of the iron curtain .
it was often linked to certain football teams , and occasionally broke out in extreme violence , such as the attack of 30 skinheads on a concert in a church in central east berlin in 1987 .
the far-right movement in the east capitalized on what many describe as the gdr 's denial of its own nazi history .
olaf sundermeyer , author of " in the npd , " a book about the development of germany 's populist far-right national democratic party , believes the gdr 's distanced attitude to hitler 's germany helped feed the neo-nazi movement .
" communist leaders in the gdr said , ' we are an anti-fascist state and we have no responsibility for history .
there are no nazis here . '
of course that was n't true .
there were former nazis in both east and west germany , but there was no denazification in east germany - the nazi history was not dealt with , " he said .
imbalance and injustice east german society was never particularly multicultural , and the government 's immigration policies showed a determination to keep the population monotone .
immigrant workers from other socialist countries like mozambique were sent home if they got pregnant , or as soon as their allotted time ran out .
the lack of a multicultural foundation is still reflected in eastern german society today .
" eastern germany has a lot fewer immigrants - and it has long been acknowledged that where there are no immigrants and no jews , there is more racism and anti-semitism , " borstel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has caused unrest in the former gdr neo-nazis were also able to win over some east germans with familiar ideas .
" national socialism often starts out with the idea of socialism , and then that is combined with frustration , unemployment , lack of opportunity , and populations moving away . "
this is the opinion of a former neo-nazi who wants to remain anonymous , working for exit deutschland , an organization that helps people leave the far-right scene .
there is a widespread feeling that the west left the east behind economically .
in the last 20 years , unemployment in the former east has been consistently twice as high as in the west , and the emigration of young eastern germans remains a problem .
statistical evidence shows that german far-right parties tend to prosper in times of economic depression , and the npd has aimed its electoral resources aggressively at the most neglected districts .
the exit deutschland representative , who has counseled numerous former neo-nazis , said that the frustration that comes from being left behind after watching friends leave your home town is a factor common to many of those who turn to right-wing extremism .
" those who stay , for whatever reason - because they ca n't find a job anywhere else , for example - feel an enormous frustration .
that is fertile ground for far-right groups - and for extremist groups in general , " he said .
sympathy for the left this growing eastern german sympathy with the far-right chimed in with a study completed in 2003 , which found that 16 percent of germans had an extreme right-wing world-view - that is , they expressed chauvinistic , anti-semitic , social-darwinist or xenophobic opinions , and tended to trivialize the nazi regime .
in the east , this world-view was found in 23 percent of the population , compared to 14 percent in the west .
this showed a marked change from the early 1990s , when a similar study found far-right-wing opinion more prevalent in the west .
statisticians have linked this switch to a decline in economic expectation .
whereas easterners were more optimistic about their economic prospects in the early 1990s , by the late 1990s , westerners had become more positive about the economy .
behind this turnaround lay a real sense of betrayal .
in a study written in 2005 , political scientist richard stoess wrote , " that the eastern german people overtook their western compatriots in sympathy for right-wing extremism lay in the fact that their initial trust in the western system of democracy and market economy had turned into particularly bitter disappointment . "
neo-nazis for the new century as state authority began to re-assert itself in the east , the far-right developed more subtle ways to organize .
" the structures have become smaller , " said borstel .
" they no longer rely on large parties like the npd , but rather local cells , which are more difficult for the state to break up .
they have become anchored in local communities in a way i thought would never happen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far-right has reinvented itself for the new century this assimilation was mirrored in the far-right political parties , which have spent the past decade making themselves electable in the east .
although the npd have steadily lost ground in the former west , in the east they have gained a foothold in several state parliaments .
" the big bang was the state election of 2004 in saxony , where the npd first gained representation in an eastern german state parliament , " said sundermeyer .
" since then it has very gradually established itself as a ' normal ' party . "
the npd was re-elected to the saxony parliament in 2009 , with 5.6 percent of the vote .
the npd 's membership figures had risen from 4,000 in 1995 to 6,800 in 2009 .
the npd has achieved this success by aiming its messages at young people , especially via the internet , and appealing to sentiments shared by the far-left - anti-americanism , anti-israel , anti-globalization .
it has worked to pick up the youth protest vote , targeting sub-cultures with an anti-system stance . author : ben knight editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a less than stellar start , they 'll try to reverse their fortunes by picking the winners and losers correctly this week . match day five in the bundesliga is upon us , and the only ones doing worse than schalke are dw 's team of football freaks .
we pulled off a rare feat last time around and managed to get all the results wrong -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but winners never quit , and quitters never win .
so we 're back at it again for the midweek matches .
here 's goes nothing .
tuesday , september 21 mainz – cologne mainz are topping the table to everyone 's surprise and look like a very solid team with a variety of players who can score .
cologne are doing what they do best and eking enough points to stay just above the relegation zone .
the billy goats held bayern to a scoreless draw in the last round , and they should be able to do the same against mainz .
prediction : 0-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings and bremen will look to get a boot in against hanover hoffenheim – bayern munich hoffenheim are off to a fine start , while bayern have n't scored in their past three matches .
not having arjen robben is a big factor , of course , and ivica olic has yet to find last season 's form .
but no one 's panicking in munich yet , and we think bayern will find their range again on tuesday .
prediction : bayern 2-1 hanover – werder bremen after two wins and a draw , hanover reverted to their meek losing form last weekend , while bremen will be looking for redemption after losing to mainz at home .
both teams are suspect at the back so this could be a real goal-fest , which always favors bremen .
prediction : bremen 4-2 wednesday , september 22 leverkusen – frankfurt frankfurt have looked better than their 1-0-3 record while leverkusen will have to get used to life without stefan kiessling , whose ankle injury will sideline him for the foreseeable future .
put those two things together and what you come out with is a dull draw .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thins have been hunky-dory for the men in yellow dortmund – kaiserslautern dortmund 's main challenge in this match is to get their feet back on the ground after thrashing arch-rivals schalke away on sunday .
kaiserslautern are proving difficult to beat , but then again dortmund , with its huge crowds , is a very difficult place to play , especially for a newly promoted team .
prediction : dortmund 2-1 hamburg – wolfsburg intriguing , intriguing .
there 's was little to like about hamburg 's draw with st. pauli over the weekend – except for mladen petric 's stunning goal .
if petric gets into the line-up , the northern germans should be able to handle the wolves , who have yet to show they can beat a good team .
prediction : hamburg 2-1 moenchengladbach – st. pauli this is a crucial match for gladbach after the foals got hammered to the tune of 7-1 by previously winless stuttgart .
st. pauli should give their back four much more time to get sorted , and gladbach have proven they can score goals .
prediction : gladbach 2-0 freiburg – schalke speaking of teams facing must-win situations … schalke .
four games , zero points , and a team that 's yet to gel on the pitch is the sad summation of the royal blues campaign thus far .
meanwhile , freiburg are a surprising fourth in the table , albeit thanks to a couple of lucky results .
schalke have n't had enough time to get their house in order , but a point should be within reach .
prediction : 1-1 nuremberg – stuttgart nuremberg have drawn three of their first four , while stuttgart recovered from an awful start to put seven past gladbach last week .
the club will put up much sturdier resistance , but they may try too hard to get a first win in front of their home fans , which could open opportunities for the swabians .
prediction : stuttgart 2-1 and now for the really sad part … last week 's result : 0 points frankfurt - freiburg 0-1 -lrb- dw prediction : frankfurt 2-0 -rrb- bayern munich - cologne 0-0 -lrb- dw prediction : bayern 2-0 -rrb- werder bremen - mainz 0-2 -lrb- dw prediction : bremen 3-1 -rrb- stuttgart-moenchengladbach 7-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-1 -rrb- wolfsburg - hanover 2-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-2 -rrb- kaiserslautern - hoffenheim 2-2 -lrb- dw prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 -rrb- st. pauli - hamburg 1-1 -lrb- dw prediction : st. pauli 2-1 -rrb- dortmund - schalke 3-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-1 -rrb- leverkusen - nuremberg 0-0 -lrb- dw prediction : leverkusen 3-0 -rrb- total for the season : 15 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : jefferson chase editor : richard connor jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at this oktoberfest , its hard to tell this year is the 200th anniversary of oktoberfest , but you don ’ t need to go to munich to experience the famous bavarian beer festival .
instead , you could head to sydney , australia at the opposite side of the world . australians tend to enjoy drinking .
they especially like beer in large quantities .
so it 's no wonder they embrace that greatest celebration of beer : oktoberfest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guests seem to enjoy it - no matter what continent they 're on in australia 's largest city , sydney , a number of “ oktoberfest ” celebrations are held across town .
they take place at german breweries , german restaurants , a university campus and pretty much anywhere people are looking for an excuse to imbibe and be merry .
the first venue to kick off the festivities this year was the loewenbraeu keller , a bavarian brewery and restaurant in an area known as the rocks , which is one of the oldest parts of the city and not far from sydney 's famous opera house .
the oktoberfest here at the loewenbraeu began the same weekend as the real event in munich and the festivities also began in the traditional way , with a keg tapping and a subsequent " beer shower " for those standing nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a delicious meal , if you can finish it the room is a smaller version of the famous oktoberfest beer tents .
there are drapes in bavarian blue and white hanging around the room and long wooden tables at which the guests eat and drink their fill .
the waiters and waitresses – most of whom are german or german-speaking – serve the guests with a smile while wearing dirndls and lederhosen , the traditional bavarian dresses and leather pants .
there are traditional bavarian beers imported from germany on offer .
loewenbraeu is available , as well as spaten , hofbraeu and others .
few guests are able to conquer the mountain of food served up by the kitchen : schnitzel , pork knuckle , sausages , bread dumplings and sauerkraut .
the bavarians ' representative reinhard wurtz , the general manager of the loewenbraeu , has been living in australia for ten years .
although originally from lake constance , he says he feels bavarian after serving in the army there and identifying with the culture .
" i think i 'm the right representative for the bavarians , " reinhard says .
he 's certainly getting into the bavarian spirit during oktoberfest , dressed in lederhosen and singing along when the live " oompah " band strikes up a tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loewenbraeu recreates munich 's beer tents reinhard is proud of the authenticity of the loewenbraeu 's oktoberfest , claiming the brewery is the most authentic bavarian beer house outside of bavaria .
he 's even about to head back to munich for this year 's oktoberfest to make sure he stays in touch with how it 's done at home .
" you have to get ideas when you 're away for a long time , " he says .

at this oktoberfest , its hard to tell this year is the 200th anniversary of oktoberfest , but you don ’ t need to go to munich to experience the famous bavarian beer festival .
instead , you could head to sydney , australia at the opposite side of the world . australians tend to enjoy drinking .
they especially like beer in large quantities .
so it 's no wonder they embrace that greatest celebration of beer : oktoberfest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guests seem to enjoy it - no matter what continent they 're on in australia 's largest city , sydney , a number of “ oktoberfest ” celebrations are held across town .
they take place at german breweries , german restaurants , a university campus and pretty much anywhere people are looking for an excuse to imbibe and be merry .
the first venue to kick off the festivities this year was the loewenbraeu keller , a bavarian brewery and restaurant in an area known as the rocks , which is one of the oldest parts of the city and not far from sydney 's famous opera house .
the oktoberfest here at the loewenbraeu began the same weekend as the real event in munich and the festivities also began in the traditional way , with a keg tapping and a subsequent " beer shower " for those standing nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a delicious meal , if you can finish it the room is a smaller version of the famous oktoberfest beer tents .
there are drapes in bavarian blue and white hanging around the room and long wooden tables at which the guests eat and drink their fill .
the waiters and waitresses – most of whom are german or german-speaking – serve the guests with a smile while wearing dirndls and lederhosen , the traditional bavarian dresses and leather pants .
there are traditional bavarian beers imported from germany on offer .
loewenbraeu is available , as well as spaten , hofbraeu and others .
few guests are able to conquer the mountain of food served up by the kitchen : schnitzel , pork knuckle , sausages , bread dumplings and sauerkraut .
the bavarians ' representative reinhard wurtz , the general manager of the loewenbraeu , has been living in australia for ten years .
although originally from lake constance , he says he feels bavarian after serving in the army there and identifying with the culture .
" i think i 'm the right representative for the bavarians , " reinhard says .
he 's certainly getting into the bavarian spirit during oktoberfest , dressed in lederhosen and singing along when the live " oompah " band strikes up a tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loewenbraeu recreates munich 's beer tents reinhard is proud of the authenticity of the loewenbraeu 's oktoberfest , claiming the brewery is the most authentic bavarian beer house outside of bavaria .
he 's even about to head back to munich for this year 's oktoberfest to make sure he stays in touch with how it 's done at home .
" you have to get ideas when you 're away for a long time , " he says .
beer matters to australians most of the guests at the loewenbraeu oktoberfest are local sydneysiders , keen to enjoy some bavarian culture .
one woman says she 's always wanted to go to the real oktoberfest , but has never had the chance .
this is the next best thing , she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelry starts with a traditional keg-tapping others have been to munich and are happy to relive the memories .
but at least one visitor , known in this article as paul – but who also gave his name as steve and peter when asked – is more honest about his reasons for attending .
" the reason we 're out tonight is mainly because beer is very important to australians , " says paul , or steve , or peter .
" it 's also about good looking girls , but mainly it 's about the boys and having a few beers . "

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .
the proposed code may make a law on the issue redundant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german interior minister hosted the one-day summit in berlin however , de maiziere recognized that such technology can be beneficial , and said he does not want to give people the right to delete images that can be viewed by the public anyway .
he does , however , want service providers to make it clearer how their privacy rights may be infringed by using particular services .
de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "
however , the interior minister wants to lay down a law to draw a " red line , " " which can not be crossed under any circumstances . "
this will be designed to stop particularly extreme violations of privacy .
if the internet companies can not decide on a code by december , de maiziere said the government would immediately intervene in the matter .
the german consumer protection minister ilse aigner welcomed the move as " a good basis , which we can build upon , and which will allow us to take into account the interests of the users . "
she demanded a balance between new technological advances , which can benefit consumers , and the protection of the privacy of individuals .
the head of internet giant google in europe , philipp schindler , also greeted the suggestion with enthusiasm and agreed his company would work with others to draw up the code .
" geo-data from the internet is becoming more important for citizens , authorities and companies , a trend which will grow further with the rise of mobile internet use , " schindler added .

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .
the proposed code may make a law on the issue redundant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german interior minister hosted the one-day summit in berlin however , de maiziere recognized that such technology can be beneficial , and said he does not want to give people the right to delete images that can be viewed by the public anyway .
he does , however , want service providers to make it clearer how their privacy rights may be infringed by using particular services .
de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "
however , the interior minister wants to lay down a law to draw a " red line , " " which can not be crossed under any circumstances . "
this will be designed to stop particularly extreme violations of privacy .
if the internet companies can not decide on a code by december , de maiziere said the government would immediately intervene in the matter .
the german consumer protection minister ilse aigner welcomed the move as " a good basis , which we can build upon , and which will allow us to take into account the interests of the users . "
she demanded a balance between new technological advances , which can benefit consumers , and the protection of the privacy of individuals .
the head of internet giant google in europe , philipp schindler , also greeted the suggestion with enthusiasm and agreed his company would work with others to draw up the code .
" geo-data from the internet is becoming more important for citizens , authorities and companies , a trend which will grow further with the rise of mobile internet use , " schindler added .

at this oktoberfest , its hard to tell this year is the 200th anniversary of oktoberfest , but you don ’ t need to go to munich to experience the famous bavarian beer festival .
instead , you could head to sydney , australia at the opposite side of the world . australians tend to enjoy drinking .
they especially like beer in large quantities .
so it 's no wonder they embrace that greatest celebration of beer : oktoberfest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guests seem to enjoy it - no matter what continent they 're on in australia 's largest city , sydney , a number of “ oktoberfest ” celebrations are held across town .
they take place at german breweries , german restaurants , a university campus and pretty much anywhere people are looking for an excuse to imbibe and be merry .
the first venue to kick off the festivities this year was the loewenbraeu keller , a bavarian brewery and restaurant in an area known as the rocks , which is one of the oldest parts of the city and not far from sydney 's famous opera house .
the oktoberfest here at the loewenbraeu began the same weekend as the real event in munich and the festivities also began in the traditional way , with a keg tapping and a subsequent " beer shower " for those standing nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a delicious meal , if you can finish it the room is a smaller version of the famous oktoberfest beer tents .
there are drapes in bavarian blue and white hanging around the room and long wooden tables at which the guests eat and drink their fill .
the waiters and waitresses – most of whom are german or german-speaking – serve the guests with a smile while wearing dirndls and lederhosen , the traditional bavarian dresses and leather pants .
there are traditional bavarian beers imported from germany on offer .
loewenbraeu is available , as well as spaten , hofbraeu and others .
few guests are able to conquer the mountain of food served up by the kitchen : schnitzel , pork knuckle , sausages , bread dumplings and sauerkraut .
the bavarians ' representative reinhard wurtz , the general manager of the loewenbraeu , has been living in australia for ten years .
although originally from lake constance , he says he feels bavarian after serving in the army there and identifying with the culture .
" i think i 'm the right representative for the bavarians , " reinhard says .
he 's certainly getting into the bavarian spirit during oktoberfest , dressed in lederhosen and singing along when the live " oompah " band strikes up a tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loewenbraeu recreates munich 's beer tents reinhard is proud of the authenticity of the loewenbraeu 's oktoberfest , claiming the brewery is the most authentic bavarian beer house outside of bavaria .
he 's even about to head back to munich for this year 's oktoberfest to make sure he stays in touch with how it 's done at home .
" you have to get ideas when you 're away for a long time , " he says .
beer matters to australians most of the guests at the loewenbraeu oktoberfest are local sydneysiders , keen to enjoy some bavarian culture .
one woman says she 's always wanted to go to the real oktoberfest , but has never had the chance .
this is the next best thing , she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelry starts with a traditional keg-tapping others have been to munich and are happy to relive the memories .
but at least one visitor , known in this article as paul – but who also gave his name as steve and peter when asked – is more honest about his reasons for attending .
" the reason we 're out tonight is mainly because beer is very important to australians , " says paul , or steve , or peter .
" it 's also about good looking girls , but mainly it 's about the boys and having a few beers . "

the researchers are presenting their work at a user interface conference in new york next month . while touch screens have existed for decades , multi-touch screens are still a relatively new innovation .
that 's the kind of screen found in the iphone , ipad and other devices .
it allows the user to touch the screen at three or more points , and enables stretching , dragging and other kinds of digital manipulation .
while multi-touch screens are becoming more and more commonplace , german researchers are now working on integrating this same technology into floors .
users would interact with the multi-touch floor by using their feet . "
when i walk across the floor with my shoes , i get a glowing , infrared imprint of my footprints , " explained patrick baudisch , head of the human computer interaction group at the hasso plattner institute in potsdam , germany . " and from that we can reconstruct where people are , and what shoes people wear because the soles are recognizable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multitoe floor would be able to identify users based on their footprints the demonstration model of the " multitoe " floor is about the size of a coffee table and measures about one meter by a half meter , and is raised up off the ground .
the floor itself is made of a thick piece of glass , topped with a black sheet of acrylic .
a camera , built-in to the floor , points up towards the ceiling .
the research team uses a technique called frustrated total internal reflection , that had been developed for use in finger-print scanners , until jeff han from new york university adapted it for use in multi-touch displays .
baudisch and his team hope that a multi-touch floor could be useful as a new way to interact with large amounts of visual data - like maps - or to play video games .
logging into the floor one of the interesting things about the floor is that you can log into it , just like a computer , because it can recognize individuals based on the pattern of their shoes .
when thomas augsten , one of the students working on the project , steps up onto the multi-touch floor , floor asks him a question : who are you ?
augsten taps the word " new " for new user , the floor scans his shoes and he 's given a color .
a keypad then appears on the floor and augsten types in his name with the toe of his shoe , making him a registered user .
while it is possible to type standing on one foot , it would probably be too tiring to write more than a few words .
one of the first challenges the research team had to overcome was how not to interact with the multi-touch floor - it has to be able to differentiate between people just walking around , and understand when they want to interact .
a smart floor could show the way according to johannes schoening , from the german research centre for artificial intelligence in saarbruecken , a touch sensitive floor could open up a whole range of possibilities . "
the main advantage is you can sense what 's going on , on the floor , " he said " but now you have to think about so what can you do with that information .
so for example if you are in the supermarket , you can provide navigational instructions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multitoe floor could be used for large scale visual applications , like maps other examples could include a smart-floor in a museum or an airport that shows you the way - or even a dance club where you can interact with the visuals on the floor .
previously , the sustainable dance club company in the netherlands created a floor that generates power when people walk , jump and dance on it .
it 's fitted with led lights that can change color , but these use as little energy as possible because generating power is the priority .
eric van duin , an engineer with sustainable dance club , said his company is excited about the potential of an interactive floor like the multitoe - just as long as it does n't use too much power . "
our touch experience is very limited , so maybe it would be very interesting to combine these technologies to enhance our dance floor " , he said .
not just entertainment because the multitoe floor has a pressure sensor , baudisch added that potentially it could also be used as a medical tool to analyse posture and assess back problems , or in an assisted living situation .
the floor could sense if people have fallen down and help to increase the safety of inhabitants - without the drawback of visual surveillance . "
we probably would n't like the idea of people installing cameras in our homes , " he said . " and so you could envision something like a touch-sensitive floor that could actually reconstruct bits of your day .
have you gotten up ?
have you gotten some exercise ?
have you dressed ?
we can reconstruct a lot of these things , but without a lot of the privacy implications that a whole camera system has . "
a future of touch-screen interactivity even so , researchers envision a future where multi-touch devices and interactive elements like walls and floors could become a part of our everyday lives - where visual data will migrate between different devices - from an iphone , to a table , or be spread out and manipulated on a multi-touch floor .
still thought , despite the current boom in multi-touch devices , schoening also cautioned that modern society should n't incorporate multi-touch technology into everything just because it 's sexy . he added that designers and application developers should also think about where multi-touch devices are actually needed . "
there are definitely some really crappy examples how we should not use multi-touch , " he said . " do we really need a multi-touch ipod nano when all the thing we can do is rotate the mainscreen ? "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 21.09.2010 new right-wing parties face major obstacles in both germany and the us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little-known tea party candidate has rocked the republican establishment while the tea party is gaining strength in the us , some conservatives in germany question whether the ruling christian democrats are still conservative enough .
could new right-wing parties emerge in both countries ? the latest shock to the system came for the republican party in the name of christine o 'donnell .
her stunning victory over the establishment-backed candidate in the republican primary in the state of delaware catapulted the tea party activist from obscurity into the limelight .
on the same day , in the new york republican primary , a tea party supporter also beat the candidate favored by the party hierarchy .
their upsets , but also the growing public profile of a movement which has been supported by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin and right-wing talk-show host glenn beck , signal a possible realignment within the conservative political spectrum of the united states .
the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .
unlike most other advanced democracies , germany and the us so far have only one mainstream conservative party .
could that change now with a new right-wing party emerging in both countries ? economic loss while germany and the us share a segment of the electorate that is unhappy with the current situation and the political elite , the chances for a new party to the right of the center to profit from this malaise are vastly different , argue experts .
" what you have in these advanced industrial democracies is a general fear or sense of economic loss and i think this is very justified , " andrei markovits , professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , told deutsche welle .
" the response i may not agree with , but there is clearly a sense of that for the first time maybe the next generation will not be as well off as its parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tea party movement has been supported by fox news talk show host glenn beck however , below the surface of discontent with the conservative mainstream , the constituents of the tea party have a distinct background and motivation that sets them apart from the disenchanted conservatives in germany , notes thomas poguntke , professor for comparative politics at heinrich heine university in duesseldorf .
" i think the religious component of the tea party is a lot stronger than the religious component of the intra-conservative dissent in germany .
i would argue that the german debate within the christian democratic party has a lot to do with that the profile of the christian parties in germany has become a lot more unclear than it was in the past , " he told deutsche welle .
libertarian roots what 's more , says stephen silvia , a comparative politics expert at american university in washington d.c. , " the tea party is a party that is fundamentally a libertarian party .
and when one looks at the german political landscape the party that is ideologically closest to the tea party is not the cdu , but the -lrb- free market-oriented liberal party - ed . -rrb-
fdp . "
while it appears at the moment that the tea party movement stands a much better chance than the disenfranchized german conservatives of having a concrete impact on politics and policies , the likelihood of the tea party becoming a unique political force in the us is next to none .
" in the anglo-american so-called first-past-the-post system it is very difficult to create a successful third party , " says markovits .
" in fact the american history is littered with the graveyard of so-called third parties . "
poguntke concurs that the us two-party system is so strongly entrenched in the way the political system works that the only viable option for dissenting voices is to work through the existing parties .
he adds : " what the tea party movement is about is changing the republican party , pulling it further to the right . "
" it seems to me that the republican party has a very serious issue on its hands , because it basically played with fire , " says markovits .
" they are really the sorceror 's apprentice in that they played with it and then this suddenly became big and endangered the party itself . "
hurdles for new right-wing party in germany due to germany 's electoral system of proportional representation , the structural hurdles for establishing a new party are lower as the rise of the greens and left party has indicated .
but none of the experts interviewed by deutsche welle predicts the emergence of a national party right of the cdu in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the cdu is devoid of conservative voices the switch from a successful movement to a successful party is very difficult , says markovits .
" it 's a totally different gig .
movements can talk , movements have phenomenal voice options , whether they have the same deed options in a very complex parliamentarian system is a completely different story .
if you want to be a player , that 's a very tall order . "
what 's more , says poguntke , " there also is a stronger taboo to mobilize on the right in germany as in most other european countries due to our nazi past . "
in addition , he adds , until now the conservative parties in germany have always been very clever to cover their right-wing flank .
" i think to a certain degree this debate in germany is based on the partially false assumption that there is a huge electorate which is structurally very conservative , " says poguntke . there certainly are conservatives who do n't feel at home in the cdu anymore , he contends . " but this portion of the population is not as big as it used to be . "
for all those reasons , the experts view the battle over the soul of the republican party as the more interesting intra-conservative rumblings .
" the only chance is for the republicans to walk this fine tight rope that they have to moderate and also try to keep these guys , " says markovits .
" whether they can do it , i actually doubt very much because at the moment i do n't see a major republican leader who could do it .
ronald reagan could have . "

could new right-wing parties emerge in both countries ? the latest shock to the system came for the republican party in the name of christine o 'donnell .
her stunning victory over the establishment-backed candidate in the republican primary in the state of delaware catapulted the tea party activist from obscurity into the limelight .
on the same day , in the new york republican primary , a tea party supporter also beat the candidate favored by the party hierarchy .
their upsets , but also the growing public profile of a movement which has been supported by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin and right-wing talk-show host glenn beck , signal a possible realignment within the conservative political spectrum of the united states .
the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .
unlike most other advanced democracies , germany and the us so far have only one mainstream conservative party .
could that change now with a new right-wing party emerging in both countries ? economic loss while germany and the us share a segment of the electorate that is unhappy with the current situation and the political elite , the chances for a new party to the right of the center to profit from this malaise are vastly different , argue experts .
" what you have in these advanced industrial democracies is a general fear or sense of economic loss and i think this is very justified , " andrei markovits , professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , told deutsche welle .
" the response i may not agree with , but there is clearly a sense of that for the first time maybe the next generation will not be as well off as its parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tea party movement has been supported by fox news talk show host glenn beck however , below the surface of discontent with the conservative mainstream , the constituents of the tea party have a distinct background and motivation that sets them apart from the disenchanted conservatives in germany , notes thomas poguntke , professor for comparative politics at heinrich heine university in duesseldorf .
" i think the religious component of the tea party is a lot stronger than the religious component of the intra-conservative dissent in germany .
i would argue that the german debate within the christian democratic party has a lot to do with that the profile of the christian parties in germany has become a lot more unclear than it was in the past , " he told deutsche welle .
libertarian roots what 's more , says stephen silvia , a comparative politics expert at american university in washington d.c. , " the tea party is a party that is fundamentally a libertarian party .
and when one looks at the german political landscape the party that is ideologically closest to the tea party is not the cdu , but the -lrb- free market-oriented liberal party - ed . -rrb-
fdp . "
while it appears at the moment that the tea party movement stands a much better chance than the disenfranchized german conservatives of having a concrete impact on politics and policies , the likelihood of the tea party becoming a unique political force in the us is next to none .
" in the anglo-american so-called first-past-the-post system it is very difficult to create a successful third party , " says markovits .
" in fact the american history is littered with the graveyard of so-called third parties . "
poguntke concurs that the us two-party system is so strongly entrenched in the way the political system works that the only viable option for dissenting voices is to work through the existing parties .
he adds : " what the tea party movement is about is changing the republican party , pulling it further to the right . "
" it seems to me that the republican party has a very serious issue on its hands , because it basically played with fire , " says markovits .
" they are really the sorceror 's apprentice in that they played with it and then this suddenly became big and endangered the party itself . "
hurdles for new right-wing party in germany due to germany 's electoral system of proportional representation , the structural hurdles for establishing a new party are lower as the rise of the greens and left party has indicated .
but none of the experts interviewed by deutsche welle predicts the emergence of a national party right of the cdu in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the cdu is devoid of conservative voices the switch from a successful movement to a successful party is very difficult , says markovits .
" it 's a totally different gig .
movements can talk , movements have phenomenal voice options , whether they have the same deed options in a very complex parliamentarian system is a completely different story .
if you want to be a player , that 's a very tall order . "
what 's more , says poguntke , " there also is a stronger taboo to mobilize on the right in germany as in most other european countries due to our nazi past . "
in addition , he adds , until now the conservative parties in germany have always been very clever to cover their right-wing flank .
" i think to a certain degree this debate in germany is based on the partially false assumption that there is a huge electorate which is structurally very conservative , " says poguntke . there certainly are conservatives who do n't feel at home in the cdu anymore , he contends . " but this portion of the population is not as big as it used to be . "
for all those reasons , the experts view the battle over the soul of the republican party as the more interesting intra-conservative rumblings .
" the only chance is for the republicans to walk this fine tight rope that they have to moderate and also try to keep these guys , " says markovits .
" whether they can do it , i actually doubt very much because at the moment i do n't see a major republican leader who could do it .
ronald reagan could have . "

a lot of money has been spent on development of the eastern states and the process is not yet finished . things did not go entirely to plan when , on july 1 , 1990 monetary , economic and social union and the deutschmark were introduced in east germany .
citizens of east germany greeted the changes with celebration but for the former socialist republic 's economy the consequences were devastating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall may have fallen , but economic divisions remain bonds and savings up to the value of 6,000 east german marks could be exchanged one-to-one for the deutschmark , but now firms had to pay for salaries in the new west german currency .
overnight , eastern companies were plunged defenselessly into competition with the west german economy - and they could only emerge as losers .
demand for east german products dropped dramatically as citizens simply did not want to buy the familiar old products with their new deutschmarks .
whether it was a basic food , a luxury item , technical equipment or a vehicle - it had to be a product from the west .
no alternative to monetary union experts had anticipated that monetary union would ruin the east german economy .
however , the then west german finance minister theo waigel said there was no alternative in 1990 .
the popular east german call of that year became " if the deutschmark does n't come to us , we will go to the deutschmark ! " and there was already mass immigration to the west .
" in the finance ministry at the time we discussed all theoretical possibilities , step-by step plans and ways to make the situation better . " said waigel .

it would have been like putting up another wall in germany . "

former west german businesses did indeed sell their products in the east , but these continued to be produced in the west .
industrial jobs in the eastern states emerged only slowly .
even today , the economic output in the former east german states is only 71 percent of the level in the west .
gross domestic product per capita generated by private industry - a standard measure of performance - stands at around 66 percent of that in the west . continued solidarity waigel said that the development of the east had been the greatest act of solidarity to have ever taken place in germany .
he added that this was continuing ; it remains the case that none of the eastern states can finance itself .
according to the current plan of the german government the so called solidarity pact - about sharing the costs of development - is supposed to run until 2019 .

no alternative to monetary union experts had anticipated that monetary union would ruin the east german economy .
however , the then west german finance minister theo waigel said there was no alternative in 1990 .
the popular east german call of that year became " if the deutschmark does n't come to us , we will go to the deutschmark ! " and there was already mass immigration to the west .
" in the finance ministry at the time we discussed all theoretical possibilities , step-by step plans and ways to make the situation better . " said waigel .
" but introducing these plans would not have helped .
it would have been like putting up another wall in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister in 1990 theo waigel said all possibilities were explored in the united germany , economic power remained unevenly distributed .
former west german businesses did indeed sell their products in the east , but these continued to be produced in the west .
industrial jobs in the eastern states emerged only slowly .
even today , the economic output in the former east german states is only 71 percent of the level in the west .
gross domestic product per capita generated by private industry - a standard measure of performance - stands at around 66 percent of that in the west . continued solidarity waigel said that the development of the east had been the greatest act of solidarity to have ever taken place in germany .
he added that this was continuing ; it remains the case that none of the eastern states can finance itself .
according to the current plan of the german government the so called solidarity pact - about sharing the costs of development - is supposed to run until 2019 .

however , he said , rules must be strictly observed . european central bank president jean-claude trichet has hailed the efforts of estonia in edging closer to joining the eurozone .
trichet said on monday that the fact that the baltic state had qualified showed that the currency bloc still had room to expand , despite recent concerns over the integrity of the currency .
estonia is due to become the eurozone 's 17th member on january 1 .
trichet said this showed that " that the euro area is not a ' closed shop ' but is open to those countries and economies that are fully compliant with the entry criteria in a convincing and sustainable manner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro will be circulate alongside the kroon for two weeks trichet used an address in the estonian capital tallinn to repeat calls to strengthen the eurozone 's foundations and avoid the possibility of a new sovereign debt crisis , similar to that in greece earlier this year .
" the success of the euro depends on all euro area countries seriously engaging with the responsibilities that go hand in hand with the considerable benefits that euro area membership offers , " trichet said .
prices in estonia are already being displayed in euros as well as estonian kroons and there will be a two week period of dual circulation before the kroon ceases to become legal tender .
although the eu has approved a rescue fund for european states in danger of a debt crisis - worth 440 billion euros -lrb- $ 575 billion -rrb- - there are fresh fears about high levels of borrowing in greece , ireland and portugal .

the french interior minister says the country is facing a " real terrorist threat . " the security level in france has been heightened after receiving intelligence that there was a threat of a possible suicide attack .
the tip-off came from algerian intelligence services and the potential bomber was thought to be a woman targeting either the paris metro transport system or a public gathering place .
" the terrorism threat is real , we have increased our vigilance , " said interior minister brice hortefeux on monday , without giving any specific details .
the heightened alert follows last tuesday 's ban on the wearing of the islamic face veil in public and recent military action against suspected islamic militants in north africa .
niger kidnappings authorities have warned an attack was increasingly possible since july when french soldiers were involved in a raid on an al qaeda camp in mali .

as a result of the french action , aqim assassinated a 78-year-old french engineer who they took hostage in niger .
in addition , five french nationals were kidnapped in niger last week , reportedly by aqim .
the head of france 's counter intelligence service , bernard squarcini , has appeared in several interviews recently evoking the heightened alert , telling le monde on sunday : " carrying out an attack on our territory is among their objectives . "
authorities have visibly boosted police and military units patrolling landmarks , including the eiffel tower , where 2,000 people were evacuated last week after a hoax bomb threat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 21.09.2010 new right-wing parties face major obstacles in both germany and the us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little-known tea party candidate has rocked the republican establishment while the tea party is gaining strength in the us , some conservatives in germany question whether the ruling christian democrats are still conservative enough .
could new right-wing parties emerge in both countries ? the latest shock to the system came for the republican party in the name of christine o 'donnell .
her stunning victory over the establishment-backed candidate in the republican primary in the state of delaware catapulted the tea party activist from obscurity into the limelight .
on the same day , in the new york republican primary , a tea party supporter also beat the candidate favored by the party hierarchy .
their upsets , but also the growing public profile of a movement which has been supported by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin and right-wing talk-show host glenn beck , signal a possible realignment within the conservative political spectrum of the united states .
the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .
unlike most other advanced democracies , germany and the us so far have only one mainstream conservative party .
could that change now with a new right-wing party emerging in both countries ? economic loss while germany and the us share a segment of the electorate that is unhappy with the current situation and the political elite , the chances for a new party to the right of the center to profit from this malaise are vastly different , argue experts .
" what you have in these advanced industrial democracies is a general fear or sense of economic loss and i think this is very justified , " andrei markovits , professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , told deutsche welle .
" the response i may not agree with , but there is clearly a sense of that for the first time maybe the next generation will not be as well off as its parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tea party movement has been supported by fox news talk show host glenn beck however , below the surface of discontent with the conservative mainstream , the constituents of the tea party have a distinct background and motivation that sets them apart from the disenchanted conservatives in germany , notes thomas poguntke , professor for comparative politics at heinrich heine university in duesseldorf .
" i think the religious component of the tea party is a lot stronger than the religious component of the intra-conservative dissent in germany .
i would argue that the german debate within the christian democratic party has a lot to do with that the profile of the christian parties in germany has become a lot more unclear than it was in the past , " he told deutsche welle .
libertarian roots what 's more , says stephen silvia , a comparative politics expert at american university in washington d.c. , " the tea party is a party that is fundamentally a libertarian party .
and when one looks at the german political landscape the party that is ideologically closest to the tea party is not the cdu , but the -lrb- free market-oriented liberal party - ed . -rrb-
fdp . "
while it appears at the moment that the tea party movement stands a much better chance than the disenfranchized german conservatives of having a concrete impact on politics and policies , the likelihood of the tea party becoming a unique political force in the us is next to none .
" in the anglo-american so-called first-past-the-post system it is very difficult to create a successful third party , " says markovits .
" in fact the american history is littered with the graveyard of so-called third parties . "
poguntke concurs that the us two-party system is so strongly entrenched in the way the political system works that the only viable option for dissenting voices is to work through the existing parties .
he adds : " what the tea party movement is about is changing the republican party , pulling it further to the right . "
" it seems to me that the republican party has a very serious issue on its hands , because it basically played with fire , " says markovits .
" they are really the sorceror 's apprentice in that they played with it and then this suddenly became big and endangered the party itself . "
hurdles for new right-wing party in germany due to germany 's electoral system of proportional representation , the structural hurdles for establishing a new party are lower as the rise of the greens and left party has indicated .
but none of the experts interviewed by deutsche welle predicts the emergence of a national party right of the cdu in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the cdu is devoid of conservative voices the switch from a successful movement to a successful party is very difficult , says markovits .
" it 's a totally different gig .
movements can talk , movements have phenomenal voice options , whether they have the same deed options in a very complex parliamentarian system is a completely different story .
if you want to be a player , that 's a very tall order . "
what 's more , says poguntke , " there also is a stronger taboo to mobilize on the right in germany as in most other european countries due to our nazi past . "
in addition , he adds , until now the conservative parties in germany have always been very clever to cover their right-wing flank .
" i think to a certain degree this debate in germany is based on the partially false assumption that there is a huge electorate which is structurally very conservative , " says poguntke . there certainly are conservatives who do n't feel at home in the cdu anymore , he contends . " but this portion of the population is not as big as it used to be . "
for all those reasons , the experts view the battle over the soul of the republican party as the more interesting intra-conservative rumblings .
" the only chance is for the republicans to walk this fine tight rope that they have to moderate and also try to keep these guys , " says markovits .
" whether they can do it , i actually doubt very much because at the moment i do n't see a major republican leader who could do it .
ronald reagan could have . "

the researchers are presenting their work at a user interface conference in new york next month . while touch screens have existed for decades , multi-touch screens are still a relatively new innovation .
that 's the kind of screen found in the iphone , ipad and other devices .
it allows the user to touch the screen at three or more points , and enables stretching , dragging and other kinds of digital manipulation .
while multi-touch screens are becoming more and more commonplace , german researchers are now working on integrating this same technology into floors .
users would interact with the multi-touch floor by using their feet . "
when i walk across the floor with my shoes , i get a glowing , infrared imprint of my footprints , " explained patrick baudisch , head of the human computer interaction group at the hasso plattner institute in potsdam , germany . " and from that we can reconstruct where people are , and what shoes people wear because the soles are recognizable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multitoe floor would be able to identify users based on their footprints the demonstration model of the " multitoe " floor is about the size of a coffee table and measures about one meter by a half meter , and is raised up off the ground .
the floor itself is made of a thick piece of glass , topped with a black sheet of acrylic .
a camera , built-in to the floor , points up towards the ceiling .
the research team uses a technique called frustrated total internal reflection , that had been developed for use in finger-print scanners , until jeff han from new york university adapted it for use in multi-touch displays .
baudisch and his team hope that a multi-touch floor could be useful as a new way to interact with large amounts of visual data - like maps - or to play video games .
logging into the floor one of the interesting things about the floor is that you can log into it , just like a computer , because it can recognize individuals based on the pattern of their shoes .
when thomas augsten , one of the students working on the project , steps up onto the multi-touch floor , floor asks him a question : who are you ?
augsten taps the word " new " for new user , the floor scans his shoes and he 's given a color .
a keypad then appears on the floor and augsten types in his name with the toe of his shoe , making him a registered user .
while it is possible to type standing on one foot , it would probably be too tiring to write more than a few words .
one of the first challenges the research team had to overcome was how not to interact with the multi-touch floor - it has to be able to differentiate between people just walking around , and understand when they want to interact .
a smart floor could show the way according to johannes schoening , from the german research centre for artificial intelligence in saarbruecken , a touch sensitive floor could open up a whole range of possibilities . "
the main advantage is you can sense what 's going on , on the floor , " he said " but now you have to think about so what can you do with that information .
so for example if you are in the supermarket , you can provide navigational instructions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multitoe floor could be used for large scale visual applications , like maps other examples could include a smart-floor in a museum or an airport that shows you the way - or even a dance club where you can interact with the visuals on the floor .
previously , the sustainable dance club company in the netherlands created a floor that generates power when people walk , jump and dance on it .
it 's fitted with led lights that can change color , but these use as little energy as possible because generating power is the priority .
eric van duin , an engineer with sustainable dance club , said his company is excited about the potential of an interactive floor like the multitoe - just as long as it does n't use too much power . "
our touch experience is very limited , so maybe it would be very interesting to combine these technologies to enhance our dance floor " , he said .
not just entertainment because the multitoe floor has a pressure sensor , baudisch added that potentially it could also be used as a medical tool to analyse posture and assess back problems , or in an assisted living situation .
the floor could sense if people have fallen down and help to increase the safety of inhabitants - without the drawback of visual surveillance . "
we probably would n't like the idea of people installing cameras in our homes , " he said . " and so you could envision something like a touch-sensitive floor that could actually reconstruct bits of your day .
have you gotten up ?
have you gotten some exercise ?
have you dressed ?
we can reconstruct a lot of these things , but without a lot of the privacy implications that a whole camera system has . "
a future of touch-screen interactivity even so , researchers envision a future where multi-touch devices and interactive elements like walls and floors could become a part of our everyday lives - where visual data will migrate between different devices - from an iphone , to a table , or be spread out and manipulated on a multi-touch floor .
still thought , despite the current boom in multi-touch devices , schoening also cautioned that modern society should n't incorporate multi-touch technology into everything just because it 's sexy . he added that designers and application developers should also think about where multi-touch devices are actually needed . "
there are definitely some really crappy examples how we should not use multi-touch , " he said . " do we really need a multi-touch ipod nano when all the thing we can do is rotate the mainscreen ? "

merkel said that more conditions should be attached to aid to ensure effective results . chancellor angela merkel has called for the governments of developing nations to take more responsibility in fighting poverty .
the chancellor also said that developed nations should attach tighter conditions to the money they lend and argued in favor of linking the amount to results already achieved .

merkel said that more conditions should be attached to aid to ensure effective results . chancellor angela merkel has called for the governments of developing nations to take more responsibility in fighting poverty .
the chancellor also said that developed nations should attach tighter conditions to the money they lend and argued in favor of linking the amount to results already achieved .
she said that countries should not rely indefinitely on handouts and had to take charge of their own development . she added social progress was " unthinkable " without good governance and human rights .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit has brought together some 140 world leaders " there is one thing we have to accept , " said merkel .
" the primary responsibility for development lies with the governments of the developing countries .
it is in their hands whether aid can be effective .
therefore , support for good governance is as important as aid itself . "
merkel made her comments at the un general assembly 's special session on the millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- in new york on tuesday , an event attended by some 140 heads of state or government .
they are reviewing the progress of the mdgs agreed 10 years ago to cut poverty , and improve gender quality , health and education .
aid should be used more effectively firm conditions to ensure that money was spent in an effective way should be applied , according to the chancellor .
" development aid can not continue indefinitely .
the task is to use limited resources as effectively as possible . "
" we have to put results-based development aid at center stage , " merkel said .
" it should just only be about money but also about what comes of that money . "
the chancellor added lasting progress on development would require the world to successfully address challenges in four fields - peace and security , poverty reduction , environmental protection and promotion of human rights and good governance .
germany is the third biggest contributor to the un budget and it is one of the largest development aid donors .
potential for german seat on the security council the chancellor is keen for germany to become a non-permanent member of the influential un security council .
she claimed on tuesday that she had received " a lot of support and encouragment " for germany 's bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is hoping germany will get a seat on the un security council a seat on the un 's peacekeeping council would allow germany to " present its views more strongly . "
the new non-permanent members will be elected by the general assemby in october .
however , the aid organization oxfam expressed disappointment in merkel 's speech .
" we expected much more from the german contribution , " oxfam spokeswoman emma seery commented after the speech .
" germany did not say how it will keep its promises to help poorer countries . "
helping women help themselves many experts are concerned that a number of the mdgs on poverty are unlikely to be achieved by the 2015 deadline .
several speakers at the meeting said the goals would not be achieved unless more is done to improve the lives of poor women .
liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf , africa 's first female head of state , called for more investment in sectors that help women , including agriculture and small businesses .
" as we renew our resolve in the year 2010 , we must recognize the need for inclusive economic growth , " she said .
the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , announced that 1 billion euros -lrb- 1.3 billion dollars -rrb- would be given to help africa , the caribbean and pacific countries lagging behind their mdgs .
barroso urged other donors not to use the economic crisis as an excuse to shirk their responsibilities to the poor .
" the international community still has a long way to go before the millennium goals are reached , " he said .

program guide programs made in germany video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home / dw-tv arabia : made in germany question of the week -pipe- 21.09.2010 would you drive an electric car ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day it may be the most common form of transport .
it is quiet , nimble and practical , and it is powered by environmentally friendly energy .
but it has not yet managed to live up to that promise . what needs to be done to encourage people to drive electric cars ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : joe l. country : usa i bought a new prius back in 2007 , and if there is anything better i will buy it .
as soon as they are perfected i will own an electric car . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : john k. country : canada in my opinion , electric cars will not be the mainstream of transportation , fuels from water or solid " fuels " will be the ultimate energy used . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : ramesh p. country : india electric cars are very good for keeping a green environment .
the main goal for the future would be now to make these cars affordable , so common people can buy them .
but the batteries should be efficient , they should have a long lifespan and a good capacity .
it shouldn ’ t be expensive to have them changed every two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : marcio s. country : brazil my opinion is : while high gas prices and environmental concerns have driven increasing interest in electric cars , that interest has been frustrating since there are no available , fully functioning electric cars on the market .
the reason ?
extraordinarily high battery costs of up to $ 30,000 per vehicle killed the business case for the electric cars test marketed by automakers in the 1990s .
while we 're waiting for better and cheaper batteries to come , there are some limited choices available , if you still want to buy an electric car .
understand that most electric cars are different than conventional vehicles , and consider whether these differences are important to you .
weigh the positive -lrb- zero localized emissions , pennies-per-mile costs , convenient at-home recharging -rrb- and the negative -lrb- high purchase price , limited functionality , unknown resale value -rrb- criteria . it would definitely give us more pleasure to drive electric cars , so let the people know it is easy , let them think about the future of mankind - oil or gas cars will only be a legends , but electric cars are already the future ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : brent d. country : usa instead of relying on batteries that have to be charged by " plugging " them in to an outlet , why not utilize the spinning of the wheels to act as turbines to charge the batteries whenever the car is driven ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : r. mohammad h. country : india given the opportunity , i would drive an electric car .
here in india we do have an electric car available on the market , called reva , but i have not been able to purchase one , because not only is it almost as expensive as a premium small car , but it has also only two seats and a range of only 80 km per charge .
now that the world has finally woken up to the need for electric cars , i can now look forward to one with more choice in terms of price , capacity and range , in the not too distant future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : thorsten d. country : germany no doubt , e-cars will become the normal everyday vehicle in the near future . the most important thing is that a reasonable solution is found for a new type of battery , because for me it seems essential that those should provide a much greater km-range than the actual ones do - let ´ s say at least 300 kilometers .
another point is the design of an e-car .
it seems that for most german car builders they 're only an option to replace the combustion engine with an e-engine .
that 's definitly not the way !
there must be an entirely new concept for e-cars and weight is only one thing to consider .
on the other hand especially german car byers have to change their attitude towards cars : there mustn ´ t be an abundance of power , just as much as is necessary . do we really need to reach 100km / h in , lets say : 6 seconds ?

so we 're back at it again for the midweek matches .
here 's goes nothing .
tuesday , september 21 mainz – cologne mainz are topping the table to everyone 's surprise and look like a very solid team with a variety of players who can score .
cologne are doing what they do best and eking enough points to stay just above the relegation zone .
the billy goats held bayern to a scoreless draw in the last round , and they should be able to do the same against mainz .
prediction : 0-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings and bremen will look to get a boot in against hanover hoffenheim – bayern munich hoffenheim are off to a fine start , while bayern have n't scored in their past three matches .
not having arjen robben is a big factor , of course , and ivica olic has yet to find last season 's form .
but no one 's panicking in munich yet , and we think bayern will find their range again on tuesday .
prediction : bayern 2-1 hanover – werder bremen after two wins and a draw , hanover reverted to their meek losing form last weekend , while bremen will be looking for redemption after losing to mainz at home .
both teams are suspect at the back so this could be a real goal-fest , which always favors bremen .
prediction : bremen 4-2 wednesday , september 22 leverkusen – frankfurt frankfurt have looked better than their 1-0-3 record while leverkusen will have to get used to life without stefan kiessling , whose ankle injury will sideline him for the foreseeable future .
put those two things together and what you come out with is a dull draw .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thins have been hunky-dory for the men in yellow dortmund – kaiserslautern dortmund 's main challenge in this match is to get their feet back on the ground after thrashing arch-rivals schalke away on sunday .
kaiserslautern are proving difficult to beat , but then again dortmund , with its huge crowds , is a very difficult place to play , especially for a newly promoted team .
prediction : dortmund 2-1 hamburg – wolfsburg intriguing , intriguing .
there 's was little to like about hamburg 's draw with st. pauli over the weekend – except for mladen petric 's stunning goal .
if petric gets into the line-up , the northern germans should be able to handle the wolves , who have yet to show they can beat a good team .
prediction : hamburg 2-1 moenchengladbach – st. pauli this is a crucial match for gladbach after the foals got hammered to the tune of 7-1 by previously winless stuttgart .
st. pauli should give their back four much more time to get sorted , and gladbach have proven they can score goals .
prediction : gladbach 2-0 freiburg – schalke speaking of teams facing must-win situations … schalke .
four games , zero points , and a team that 's yet to gel on the pitch is the sad summation of the royal blues campaign thus far .
meanwhile , freiburg are a surprising fourth in the table , albeit thanks to a couple of lucky results .
schalke have n't had enough time to get their house in order , but a point should be within reach .
prediction : 1-1 nuremberg – stuttgart nuremberg have drawn three of their first four , while stuttgart recovered from an awful start to put seven past gladbach last week .
the club will put up much sturdier resistance , but they may try too hard to get a first win in front of their home fans , which could open opportunities for the swabians .

the billy goats held bayern to a scoreless draw in the last round , and they should be able to do the same against mainz .
prediction : 0-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings and bremen will look to get a boot in against hanover hoffenheim – bayern munich hoffenheim are off to a fine start , while bayern have n't scored in their past three matches .
not having arjen robben is a big factor , of course , and ivica olic has yet to find last season 's form .
but no one 's panicking in munich yet , and we think bayern will find their range again on tuesday .
prediction : bayern 2-1 hanover – werder bremen after two wins and a draw , hanover reverted to their meek losing form last weekend , while bremen will be looking for redemption after losing to mainz at home .
both teams are suspect at the back so this could be a real goal-fest , which always favors bremen .
prediction : bremen 4-2 wednesday , september 22 leverkusen – frankfurt frankfurt have looked better than their 1-0-3 record while leverkusen will have to get used to life without stefan kiessling , whose ankle injury will sideline him for the foreseeable future .
put those two things together and what you come out with is a dull draw .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thins have been hunky-dory for the men in yellow dortmund – kaiserslautern dortmund 's main challenge in this match is to get their feet back on the ground after thrashing arch-rivals schalke away on sunday .
kaiserslautern are proving difficult to beat , but then again dortmund , with its huge crowds , is a very difficult place to play , especially for a newly promoted team .
prediction : dortmund 2-1 hamburg – wolfsburg intriguing , intriguing .
there 's was little to like about hamburg 's draw with st. pauli over the weekend – except for mladen petric 's stunning goal .
if petric gets into the line-up , the northern germans should be able to handle the wolves , who have yet to show they can beat a good team .
prediction : hamburg 2-1 moenchengladbach – st. pauli this is a crucial match for gladbach after the foals got hammered to the tune of 7-1 by previously winless stuttgart .
st. pauli should give their back four much more time to get sorted , and gladbach have proven they can score goals .
prediction : gladbach 2-0 freiburg – schalke speaking of teams facing must-win situations … schalke .
four games , zero points , and a team that 's yet to gel on the pitch is the sad summation of the royal blues campaign thus far .
meanwhile , freiburg are a surprising fourth in the table , albeit thanks to a couple of lucky results .
schalke have n't had enough time to get their house in order , but a point should be within reach .
prediction : 1-1 nuremberg – stuttgart nuremberg have drawn three of their first four , while stuttgart recovered from an awful start to put seven past gladbach last week .
the club will put up much sturdier resistance , but they may try too hard to get a first win in front of their home fans , which could open opportunities for the swabians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 21.09.2010 vietnamese novelist in berlin discusses 1980s großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dung moved to berlin in 1989 german readers have a wide choice when it comes to novels translated from english or french but not necessarily from asian languages such as vietnamese .
the dung 's book , however , has made it to germany ’ s bookshelves . it is the 1980s .
tran linh is a young , well-educated man who lives in a provincial town in vietnam .
he plans to move to hanoi with his fiancée .
however , not being a member of the ruling socialist party , he is unable to obtain a valid residence permit for the capital and encounters many obstacles .
he does not have enough money to bribe the civil servants . tran linh is not a real person .
he is the main character of a novel by the dung , a vietnamese-born author who lives and works in berlin .
in der traum von orly -lrb- the dream of orly -rrb- , the author describes the various difficulties young intellectuals from vietnam would have faced some 25 years ago . " young vietnamese intellectuals didn ’ t have much choice when it came to going abroad .
it was a question of fate whether they got permission to go to russia , the gdr or poland , " the dung told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of the dream of orly was published in march 2010 " my main protagonist has one goal , " he explained .
" he wants to live in hanoi but unfortunately his situation is not very promising .
that ’ s why he draws up a big plan .
first , he has to go abroad .
orly is an address he has in mind .
he needs to make a detour to pursue his dream . " thousands of vietnamese went to gdr in 1980s to his disappointment , tran linh finds out that there is barely any chance of emigrating to france legally .
he could , if he wanted , join the growing number of boat people who escape in small fishing vessels .

government sticking to targets the country 's new center-right cabinet , headed by prime minister petr necas , has resolved to reduce the budget deficit from 5.3 percent of gross domestic product this year to 4.6 percent next year .
" i have said openly that the government will not back off , under any circumstances , " necas said in response to the demonstrations .
unions say they could accept a salary freeze , but they claim that imposing cuts of 10 percent for public sector employees is going too far .
the czech government hopes to restrict its borrowing to three percent of gdp by 2013 .
necas is pressing ahead with the cuts as part of austerity measures being adopted by governments with budget deficits across europe in the wake of the greek sovereign debt crisis .

the message is that talking helps . in response to cases of child abuse within the jesuit order in germany earlier this year , the government in march established the post of an independent commissioner and also set up a telephone hotline for victims to speak about their suffering and seek help .
since then , about 2,500 germans have made contact with her office , said commissioner christine bergmann , adding " some 60 percent of them have never previously talked about what happened to them " .
on average , the victims were now " in their 50s " , she said , with the abuse having taken place " mostly some 20 , or sometimes even 40 or 50 years ago . "
clerical culprits almost 50 percent of sex abuse cases reported took place in german institutions , primarily in the roman catholic church , as well as on a lesser scale in sports clubs and at schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at berlin 's canisius college , run by jesuits , first cases of abuse were reported in january 2010 some 34 percent of the callers claimed to have been abused within their own families or by acquaintances .
" while the perpetrators were more than 80 percent male , it was surprising to see that almost as many men as women were victims of sexual abuse " , said joerg fegert , director of the ulm university clinic , who heads the team analysing the calls .
clear message fegert said the figures his team compiled with the prior consent of the victims were " far from representative for the entire german population " .
nevertheless the message the victims wanted to send to the general public was " very clear " .
" they believe it 's important to have someone who finally listens to them and believes what they say , " he said .
" compensation is also an issue because it would mean that the victims ' suffering is officially acknowledged . "
a key demand for politics was to make sure that a statute of limitations on sexual abuse was completely abolished , fegert said , because victims ' suffering did n't end after a certain time limit .
raising public awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a telephone hotline has been set up for victims independent commissioner christine bergmann on tuesday also launched a public campaign aimed at ending " decades of ignorance about the issue of sexual abuse in germany " .
a special internet website , as well as newspaper and television advertisements , are intended to publicise the abuse telephone hotline , so that many more victims can " break out of their isolation " .
german filmmaker wim wenders produced a special tv spot entitled : " breaking the silence breaks the power of the perpetrator " .
" ignoring bad things has a long tradition in germany " , wenders said , " but this ignorance perpetuates the trauma and must be ended to prevent cases of sexual abuse from happening again . "
experts ' roundtable round-table talks organized by the german government are scheduled to be held in november to discuss legal issues concerning sexual abuse , as well as medical and financial aid for the victims .
a group of victims who were sexually abused by members of the catholic jesuit order said on monday they would seek compensation payments of more than 80,000 euros -lrb- $ 105,000 -rrb- for each of the 205 victims .
german catholic bishops , currently meeting for their autumn session in fulda , said this sum was hard to imagine , and that they would seek a broader agreement on compensation with the government in november .

the vatican says it is perplexed by these actions . the head of the vatican bank , ettore gotti tedeschi , has been placed under investigation for suspected money-laundering , judicial sources said on tuesday .
italian financial authorities have seized 23 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- from an account in the bank , officially known as the institute for works of religion -lrb- ior -rrb- .
the vatican responded saying that it was " perplexed and astonished " by the case , which is being investigated by rome magistrates .
a report by the italian news agency ansa says the money was seized as a precaution .
tedeschi and another bank manager are said to be under suspicion of breaking legislation that obliges banks to disclose information about their operations .
more than a year ago , italian investigators were reported to have been scrutinizing bank transactions worth millions of euros to see if they transgressed money laundering rules .
vatican says it backs bank transparency the italian press has reported that investigators suspect that individuals have used the bank as a " screen " to hide crimes such as fraud or tax evasion .
the bank was last involved in a major scandal in 1982 , when it was linked to the fraudulent bankruptcy of banco ambrosiano - then italy 's largest private bank .
us archbishop paul marcinkus headed the bank at the time amid accusations that the institution was linked to organized crime and alleged terrorist activities .

here , close to the equator , the sun sets for most of the year at around 6 in the evening and only rises 12 hours later .
in south american capitals like lima and quito , the population switches the lights on as soon as twilight kicks in .
but that 's not an option in villages up in the andes , most of which are n't connected to electricity grids .
across the planet , 1.6 billion people lack access to electricity , most of them in remote regions , and therefore lead their lives according to the changing of the seasons , sunrise and sunset – a way people in europe and north america stopped living hundreds of years ago .
decentralizing energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-wind hybrid systems are gaining ground the only way to bring electricity to rural areas is to focus on the development of decentralized , renewable energies .
solar panels on the roofs of huts have become a common sight in many developing nations .
these days , micro wind turbines are also becoming increasingly common , capable of covering the energy needs of households and farmsteads as well as being user-friendly and carbon-neutral .
" mini wind turbines are an excellent opportunity for developing nations , " ulf gerder from the german wind energy association -lrb- bwe -rrb- said .
in mongolia , for example , they are often the only source of energy available to nomads .
they carry their super-small wind turbines on the back of their horses .
energy needed for economic progress a reliable energy supply is a prerequisite for economic development . the populations of poor countries often depend for their electricity on diesel generators and batteries , which are costly and environmentally damaging .
mini wind turbines , on the other hand , are an efficient solution in terms both of easing poverty and helping the environment .
an east african ngo called green africa certainly thinks so , and is aiming to make them more common , installing mini wind turbines in villages in countries such as kenya , burundi and rwanda .
" access to electricity has a positive effect on many areas of life , " green africa 's kefa rabah explained .
it allows people to recharge mobile phones , for example , without having to head into a nearby town , which might be many kilometers away .
and in africa , cell phones are often a vital means of communication .
rabah also stressed how much access to electricity improves educational opportunities .
" the children of a goat herd only come home after dark , for example , " he said . " if there is electricity in their home , they can then still spend a few hours reading and doing homework . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the west bank village of susya , locals use solar panels and wind turbines to illuminate their makeshift homes but in fact , mini wind turbines are gaining in popularity not only in developing countries and emerging economies .
in europe and north america , they are seen as an attractive source of sustainable energy , and moreover , as affordable thanks to state subsidies supporting renewable energy infrastructure .
let there be light however , a major drawback to mini wind turbines in germany is that while power generated by a photovoltaic system stored in the grid is worth between 24 and 42 cents per kilowatt-hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- , energy generated by wind power is worth just 9 cents .
" solar and wind power should n't compete , they should complement one another , " gerder from the bwe said . hybrid energy providers that combine solar and wind power are indeed already available .
the winds of change are already blowing in the region of cajamarca in the remote northern highlands of peru .
the ngo " soluciones practicas " has installed mini wind turbines that provide over 4,000 families with a daily supply of electricity amounting to an average 0.3 kilowatts per hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- .
moreover , the organization ensures that every village is home to at least one technician able to repair and maintain the technology . " soluciones practicas " has also set up a training center where young people from all over the world can learn about renewable energy and take their expertise home with them .
micro turbines do n't just provide clean energy , they also offer people in remote regions the chance to be connected to the world .
in peru , the technology has already brought light to some of the darkest corners of the country .

dw-world.de use of wind energy continues to soar around the world clean wind energy is increasing in popularity around the world .

after reunification the government moved back to berlin , but bonn did n't sink into provincial obscurity .
quite the contrary . the change in bonn is most apparent on the streets around the deutsche welle building between eight and nine o 'clock in the morning .
rush hour in the post tower next door : hordes of young men in their mid- to late 30s -lrb- black suit , white shirt -rrb- and young women -lrb- business suit , blouse -rrb- , all on their way to the office .
laptop cases under their arms , cell phones glued to their ears , they stride confidently along , heading to their desks in the headquarters of the logistics company deutsche post dhl .
they could easily be employees going to work in a metropolis like london or paris .
for some , bonn is just a stopover en route to singapore , new york or hong kong .
some only stay half a year or so .
others , like christopher wade , stay here longer .
born in the united states , he now heads the communications team at deutsche post .
he met his wife when he was in bonn for a year as an exchange student and moved here in 1999 .
" i stayed without planning to , " he says .
he likes his office , high up in the transparent glass tower ; on a clear day he can see as far as cologne .
his daughter is well looked after in the deutsche post nursery .
life is good in the little town on the rhine , even now that the politicians have left .
international working environment the post tower , a lofty 162 meters -lrb- 531 feet -rrb- high , is visible for miles around .
it has long since replaced the modest beethoven house as the town 's best-known landmark .
the tower is a symbol of the former capital 's new status as a linchpin of international business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven was born in bonn but spent little time here many development organizations have settled here , too - as has the united nations .
it is represented in bonn by a number of different departments , including the secretariat of the un framework convention on climate change .
this aspect of the town is one that christopher wade , and others like him , particularly enjoys .
his working environment is an international one : " there are germans , romanians , filipinos and colleagues from singapore working in my team , " he says .
his circle of friends includes people of many different nationalities , and a great many bi-national marriages .
" bonn is certainly not a big city , but it 's got a good atmosphere .
it 's very international and multilingual .
you have the international school here ; there are students from all over the world studying at the university , and wherever i go i meet parents who work in some kind of international context . "
no call for nostalgia the days of the so-called " civil servant shuttle , " which would ferry homesick employees from their ministries back to bonn , are long gone .
everybody has moved on .
some have settled in berlin , while others have found new jobs .
a 1.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- package to compensate the town for its diminished importance and the loss of its former glory has helped to move some federal institutions to the banks of the rhine ; and six of the 15 government ministries still have their main seat here .
most of the political action now takes place in the new capital - but that does n't mean bonn is completely out of the picture .
former embassies have been spruced up and have found new owners ; the parliamentary chamber is now a conference center , and one million tourists a year demonstrate that there 's still considerable interest in the old capital on the rhine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor nimptsch faced a disaster when he moved into bonn 's town hall almost 20 years after the decision was made to move the capital to berlin , no one in bonn seems nostalgic for the old days .
why would they be ?
bonn has had to give up a lot , but it has also gained a great deal .
unemployment is relatively low , numerous modern businesses have settled here , cultural life is blossoming .
even so , bonners are currently experiencing something they are not at all used to : they 're having to tighten their belts .
" in the old days , when this was the capital , money flowed as if on tap , " explains juergen nimptsch , the mayor of bonn .
" now we have to save millions of euros , and at the same time we have a problem with a building that 's still under construction , " he adds , referring to the project he from the days when everything was conceived on a grand scale , regardless of the cost .
a big problem for a small town the " world conference center " -lrb- wccb -rrb- was conceived as a way to make bonn more attractive as a conference location after it lost its status as capital city .
but it was in reality an expensive vanity project dreamed up by a group of big shots .
it combined massaged or falsified accounts , official incompetence , dodgy business partners and criminal intrigue .
now the town is stuck with a huge unfinished building and a mountain of debt .
even so , mayor nimptsch says he would n't want to go back to the old days : " i prefer to live in the here and now ! "
and christopher wade in the post tower agrees .
" i think bonn has pretty much all you need .
just one thing : the weather could be better .
more sunshine .
i miss that here . "

it combined massaged or falsified accounts , official incompetence , dodgy business partners and criminal intrigue .
now the town is stuck with a huge unfinished building and a mountain of debt .

a big problem for a small town the " world conference center " -lrb- wccb -rrb- was conceived as a way to make bonn more attractive as a conference location after it lost its status as capital city .
but it was in reality an expensive vanity project dreamed up by a group of big shots .
it combined massaged or falsified accounts , official incompetence , dodgy business partners and criminal intrigue .
now the town is stuck with a huge unfinished building and a mountain of debt .
even so , mayor nimptsch says he would n't want to go back to the old days : " i prefer to live in the here and now ! "
and christopher wade in the post tower agrees .
" i think bonn has pretty much all you need .
just one thing : the weather could be better .
more sunshine .
i miss that here . "

after reunification the government moved back to berlin , but bonn did n't sink into provincial obscurity .
quite the contrary . the change in bonn is most apparent on the streets around the deutsche welle building between eight and nine o 'clock in the morning .
rush hour in the post tower next door : hordes of young men in their mid- to late 30s -lrb- black suit , white shirt -rrb- and young women -lrb- business suit , blouse -rrb- , all on their way to the office .
laptop cases under their arms , cell phones glued to their ears , they stride confidently along , heading to their desks in the headquarters of the logistics company deutsche post dhl .
they could easily be employees going to work in a metropolis like london or paris .
for some , bonn is just a stopover en route to singapore , new york or hong kong .
some only stay half a year or so .
others , like christopher wade , stay here longer .
born in the united states , he now heads the communications team at deutsche post .
he met his wife when he was in bonn for a year as an exchange student and moved here in 1999 .
" i stayed without planning to , " he says .
he likes his office , high up in the transparent glass tower ; on a clear day he can see as far as cologne .
his daughter is well looked after in the deutsche post nursery .
life is good in the little town on the rhine , even now that the politicians have left .
international working environment the post tower , a lofty 162 meters -lrb- 531 feet -rrb- high , is visible for miles around .
it has long since replaced the modest beethoven house as the town 's best-known landmark .
the tower is a symbol of the former capital 's new status as a linchpin of international business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven was born in bonn but spent little time here many development organizations have settled here , too - as has the united nations .
it is represented in bonn by a number of different departments , including the secretariat of the un framework convention on climate change .
this aspect of the town is one that christopher wade , and others like him , particularly enjoys .
his working environment is an international one : " there are germans , romanians , filipinos and colleagues from singapore working in my team , " he says .
his circle of friends includes people of many different nationalities , and a great many bi-national marriages .
" bonn is certainly not a big city , but it 's got a good atmosphere .
it 's very international and multilingual .
you have the international school here ; there are students from all over the world studying at the university , and wherever i go i meet parents who work in some kind of international context . "
no call for nostalgia the days of the so-called " civil servant shuttle , " which would ferry homesick employees from their ministries back to bonn , are long gone .
everybody has moved on .
some have settled in berlin , while others have found new jobs .
a 1.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- package to compensate the town for its diminished importance and the loss of its former glory has helped to move some federal institutions to the banks of the rhine ; and six of the 15 government ministries still have their main seat here .
most of the political action now takes place in the new capital - but that does n't mean bonn is completely out of the picture .
former embassies have been spruced up and have found new owners ; the parliamentary chamber is now a conference center , and one million tourists a year demonstrate that there 's still considerable interest in the old capital on the rhine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor nimptsch faced a disaster when he moved into bonn 's town hall almost 20 years after the decision was made to move the capital to berlin , no one in bonn seems nostalgic for the old days .
why would they be ?
bonn has had to give up a lot , but it has also gained a great deal .
unemployment is relatively low , numerous modern businesses have settled here , cultural life is blossoming .
even so , bonners are currently experiencing something they are not at all used to : they 're having to tighten their belts .
" in the old days , when this was the capital , money flowed as if on tap , " explains juergen nimptsch , the mayor of bonn .
" now we have to save millions of euros , and at the same time we have a problem with a building that 's still under construction , " he adds , referring to the project he from the days when everything was conceived on a grand scale , regardless of the cost .
a big problem for a small town the " world conference center " -lrb- wccb -rrb- was conceived as a way to make bonn more attractive as a conference location after it lost its status as capital city .
but it was in reality an expensive vanity project dreamed up by a group of big shots .
it combined massaged or falsified accounts , official incompetence , dodgy business partners and criminal intrigue .
now the town is stuck with a huge unfinished building and a mountain of debt .
even so , mayor nimptsch says he would n't want to go back to the old days : " i prefer to live in the here and now ! "
and christopher wade in the post tower agrees .
" i think bonn has pretty much all you need .
just one thing : the weather could be better .
more sunshine .
i miss that here . "

at this oktoberfest , its hard to tell this year is the 200th anniversary of oktoberfest , but you don ’ t need to go to munich to experience the famous bavarian beer festival .
instead , you could head to sydney , australia at the opposite side of the world . australians tend to enjoy drinking .
they especially like beer in large quantities .
so it 's no wonder they embrace that greatest celebration of beer : oktoberfest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guests seem to enjoy it - no matter what continent they 're on in australia 's largest city , sydney , a number of “ oktoberfest ” celebrations are held across town .
they take place at german breweries , german restaurants , a university campus and pretty much anywhere people are looking for an excuse to imbibe and be merry .
the first venue to kick off the festivities this year was the loewenbraeu keller , a bavarian brewery and restaurant in an area known as the rocks , which is one of the oldest parts of the city and not far from sydney 's famous opera house .
the oktoberfest here at the loewenbraeu began the same weekend as the real event in munich and the festivities also began in the traditional way , with a keg tapping and a subsequent " beer shower " for those standing nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a delicious meal , if you can finish it the room is a smaller version of the famous oktoberfest beer tents .
there are drapes in bavarian blue and white hanging around the room and long wooden tables at which the guests eat and drink their fill .
the waiters and waitresses – most of whom are german or german-speaking – serve the guests with a smile while wearing dirndls and lederhosen , the traditional bavarian dresses and leather pants .
there are traditional bavarian beers imported from germany on offer .
loewenbraeu is available , as well as spaten , hofbraeu and others .
few guests are able to conquer the mountain of food served up by the kitchen : schnitzel , pork knuckle , sausages , bread dumplings and sauerkraut .
the bavarians ' representative reinhard wurtz , the general manager of the loewenbraeu , has been living in australia for ten years .
although originally from lake constance , he says he feels bavarian after serving in the army there and identifying with the culture .
" i think i 'm the right representative for the bavarians , " reinhard says .
he 's certainly getting into the bavarian spirit during oktoberfest , dressed in lederhosen and singing along when the live " oompah " band strikes up a tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loewenbraeu recreates munich 's beer tents reinhard is proud of the authenticity of the loewenbraeu 's oktoberfest , claiming the brewery is the most authentic bavarian beer house outside of bavaria .
he 's even about to head back to munich for this year 's oktoberfest to make sure he stays in touch with how it 's done at home .
" you have to get ideas when you 're away for a long time , " he says .
beer matters to australians most of the guests at the loewenbraeu oktoberfest are local sydneysiders , keen to enjoy some bavarian culture .
one woman says she 's always wanted to go to the real oktoberfest , but has never had the chance .
this is the next best thing , she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelry starts with a traditional keg-tapping others have been to munich and are happy to relive the memories .
but at least one visitor , known in this article as paul – but who also gave his name as steve and peter when asked – is more honest about his reasons for attending .
" the reason we 're out tonight is mainly because beer is very important to australians , " says paul , or steve , or peter .
" it 's also about good looking girls , but mainly it 's about the boys and having a few beers . "

here , close to the equator , the sun sets for most of the year at around 6 in the evening and only rises 12 hours later .
in south american capitals like lima and quito , the population switches the lights on as soon as twilight kicks in .
but that 's not an option in villages up in the andes , most of which are n't connected to electricity grids .
across the planet , 1.6 billion people lack access to electricity , most of them in remote regions , and therefore lead their lives according to the changing of the seasons , sunrise and sunset – a way people in europe and north america stopped living hundreds of years ago .
decentralizing energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-wind hybrid systems are gaining ground the only way to bring electricity to rural areas is to focus on the development of decentralized , renewable energies .
solar panels on the roofs of huts have become a common sight in many developing nations .
these days , micro wind turbines are also becoming increasingly common , capable of covering the energy needs of households and farmsteads as well as being user-friendly and carbon-neutral .
" mini wind turbines are an excellent opportunity for developing nations , " ulf gerder from the german wind energy association -lrb- bwe -rrb- said .
in mongolia , for example , they are often the only source of energy available to nomads .
they carry their super-small wind turbines on the back of their horses .
energy needed for economic progress a reliable energy supply is a prerequisite for economic development . the populations of poor countries often depend for their electricity on diesel generators and batteries , which are costly and environmentally damaging .
mini wind turbines , on the other hand , are an efficient solution in terms both of easing poverty and helping the environment .
an east african ngo called green africa certainly thinks so , and is aiming to make them more common , installing mini wind turbines in villages in countries such as kenya , burundi and rwanda .
" access to electricity has a positive effect on many areas of life , " green africa 's kefa rabah explained .
it allows people to recharge mobile phones , for example , without having to head into a nearby town , which might be many kilometers away .
and in africa , cell phones are often a vital means of communication .
rabah also stressed how much access to electricity improves educational opportunities .
" the children of a goat herd only come home after dark , for example , " he said . " if there is electricity in their home , they can then still spend a few hours reading and doing homework . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the west bank village of susya , locals use solar panels and wind turbines to illuminate their makeshift homes but in fact , mini wind turbines are gaining in popularity not only in developing countries and emerging economies .
in europe and north america , they are seen as an attractive source of sustainable energy , and moreover , as affordable thanks to state subsidies supporting renewable energy infrastructure .
let there be light however , a major drawback to mini wind turbines in germany is that while power generated by a photovoltaic system stored in the grid is worth between 24 and 42 cents per kilowatt-hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- , energy generated by wind power is worth just 9 cents .
" solar and wind power should n't compete , they should complement one another , " gerder from the bwe said . hybrid energy providers that combine solar and wind power are indeed already available .
the winds of change are already blowing in the region of cajamarca in the remote northern highlands of peru .
the ngo " soluciones practicas " has installed mini wind turbines that provide over 4,000 families with a daily supply of electricity amounting to an average 0.3 kilowatts per hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- .
moreover , the organization ensures that every village is home to at least one technician able to repair and maintain the technology . " soluciones practicas " has also set up a training center where young people from all over the world can learn about renewable energy and take their expertise home with them .
micro turbines do n't just provide clean energy , they also offer people in remote regions the chance to be connected to the world .
in peru , the technology has already brought light to some of the darkest corners of the country .

dw-world.de use of wind energy continues to soar around the world clean wind energy is increasing in popularity around the world .
some 82 countries already harness energy from the wind to power homes and towns .
but the technology is still in its infancy in developing nations .
-lrb- 01.06.2010 -rrb- turbines start spinning at germany 's first offshore wind park germany 's first off-shore wind farm has gone into operation tuesday with environment minister norbert roettgen officially starting the 12 turbines constructed in the north sea .
-lrb- 27.04.2010 -rrb- the answer to clean living may be blowing in the wind wind power currently meets eight percent of national energy needs .
much of that comes from huge turbines at wind farms , but experts are now predicting major growth in a diminutive version of the same thing .

the french interior minister says the country is facing a " real terrorist threat . " the security level in france has been heightened after receiving intelligence that there was a threat of a possible suicide attack .
the tip-off came from algerian intelligence services and the potential bomber was thought to be a woman targeting either the paris metro transport system or a public gathering place .
" the terrorism threat is real , we have increased our vigilance , " said interior minister brice hortefeux on monday , without giving any specific details .

could new right-wing parties emerge in both countries ? the latest shock to the system came for the republican party in the name of christine o 'donnell .
her stunning victory over the establishment-backed candidate in the republican primary in the state of delaware catapulted the tea party activist from obscurity into the limelight .
on the same day , in the new york republican primary , a tea party supporter also beat the candidate favored by the party hierarchy .
their upsets , but also the growing public profile of a movement which has been supported by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin and right-wing talk-show host glenn beck , signal a possible realignment within the conservative political spectrum of the united states .
the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .
unlike most other advanced democracies , germany and the us so far have only one mainstream conservative party .
could that change now with a new right-wing party emerging in both countries ? economic loss while germany and the us share a segment of the electorate that is unhappy with the current situation and the political elite , the chances for a new party to the right of the center to profit from this malaise are vastly different , argue experts .
" what you have in these advanced industrial democracies is a general fear or sense of economic loss and i think this is very justified , " andrei markovits , professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , told deutsche welle .
" the response i may not agree with , but there is clearly a sense of that for the first time maybe the next generation will not be as well off as its parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tea party movement has been supported by fox news talk show host glenn beck however , below the surface of discontent with the conservative mainstream , the constituents of the tea party have a distinct background and motivation that sets them apart from the disenchanted conservatives in germany , notes thomas poguntke , professor for comparative politics at heinrich heine university in duesseldorf .
" i think the religious component of the tea party is a lot stronger than the religious component of the intra-conservative dissent in germany .
i would argue that the german debate within the christian democratic party has a lot to do with that the profile of the christian parties in germany has become a lot more unclear than it was in the past , " he told deutsche welle .
libertarian roots what 's more , says stephen silvia , a comparative politics expert at american university in washington d.c. , " the tea party is a party that is fundamentally a libertarian party .
and when one looks at the german political landscape the party that is ideologically closest to the tea party is not the cdu , but the -lrb- free market-oriented liberal party - ed . -rrb-
fdp . "
while it appears at the moment that the tea party movement stands a much better chance than the disenfranchized german conservatives of having a concrete impact on politics and policies , the likelihood of the tea party becoming a unique political force in the us is next to none .
" in the anglo-american so-called first-past-the-post system it is very difficult to create a successful third party , " says markovits .
" in fact the american history is littered with the graveyard of so-called third parties . "
poguntke concurs that the us two-party system is so strongly entrenched in the way the political system works that the only viable option for dissenting voices is to work through the existing parties .
he adds : " what the tea party movement is about is changing the republican party , pulling it further to the right . "
" it seems to me that the republican party has a very serious issue on its hands , because it basically played with fire , " says markovits .
" they are really the sorceror 's apprentice in that they played with it and then this suddenly became big and endangered the party itself . "
hurdles for new right-wing party in germany due to germany 's electoral system of proportional representation , the structural hurdles for establishing a new party are lower as the rise of the greens and left party has indicated .
but none of the experts interviewed by deutsche welle predicts the emergence of a national party right of the cdu in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the cdu is devoid of conservative voices the switch from a successful movement to a successful party is very difficult , says markovits .
" it 's a totally different gig .
movements can talk , movements have phenomenal voice options , whether they have the same deed options in a very complex parliamentarian system is a completely different story .
if you want to be a player , that 's a very tall order . "
what 's more , says poguntke , " there also is a stronger taboo to mobilize on the right in germany as in most other european countries due to our nazi past . "
in addition , he adds , until now the conservative parties in germany have always been very clever to cover their right-wing flank .
" i think to a certain degree this debate in germany is based on the partially false assumption that there is a huge electorate which is structurally very conservative , " says poguntke . there certainly are conservatives who do n't feel at home in the cdu anymore , he contends . " but this portion of the population is not as big as it used to be . "
for all those reasons , the experts view the battle over the soul of the republican party as the more interesting intra-conservative rumblings .
" the only chance is for the republicans to walk this fine tight rope that they have to moderate and also try to keep these guys , " says markovits .
" whether they can do it , i actually doubt very much because at the moment i do n't see a major republican leader who could do it .
ronald reagan could have . "

after a less than stellar start , they 'll try to reverse their fortunes by picking the winners and losers correctly this week . match day five in the bundesliga is upon us , and the only ones doing worse than schalke are dw 's team of football freaks .
we pulled off a rare feat last time around and managed to get all the results wrong -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but winners never quit , and quitters never win .
so we 're back at it again for the midweek matches .
here 's goes nothing .
tuesday , september 21 mainz – cologne mainz are topping the table to everyone 's surprise and look like a very solid team with a variety of players who can score .
cologne are doing what they do best and eking enough points to stay just above the relegation zone .
the billy goats held bayern to a scoreless draw in the last round , and they should be able to do the same against mainz .
prediction : 0-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings and bremen will look to get a boot in against hanover hoffenheim – bayern munich hoffenheim are off to a fine start , while bayern have n't scored in their past three matches .
not having arjen robben is a big factor , of course , and ivica olic has yet to find last season 's form .
but no one 's panicking in munich yet , and we think bayern will find their range again on tuesday .
prediction : bayern 2-1 hanover – werder bremen after two wins and a draw , hanover reverted to their meek losing form last weekend , while bremen will be looking for redemption after losing to mainz at home .
both teams are suspect at the back so this could be a real goal-fest , which always favors bremen .
prediction : bremen 4-2 wednesday , september 22 leverkusen – frankfurt frankfurt have looked better than their 1-0-3 record while leverkusen will have to get used to life without stefan kiessling , whose ankle injury will sideline him for the foreseeable future .
put those two things together and what you come out with is a dull draw .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thins have been hunky-dory for the men in yellow dortmund – kaiserslautern dortmund 's main challenge in this match is to get their feet back on the ground after thrashing arch-rivals schalke away on sunday .
kaiserslautern are proving difficult to beat , but then again dortmund , with its huge crowds , is a very difficult place to play , especially for a newly promoted team .
prediction : dortmund 2-1 hamburg – wolfsburg intriguing , intriguing .
there 's was little to like about hamburg 's draw with st. pauli over the weekend – except for mladen petric 's stunning goal .
if petric gets into the line-up , the northern germans should be able to handle the wolves , who have yet to show they can beat a good team .
prediction : hamburg 2-1 moenchengladbach – st. pauli this is a crucial match for gladbach after the foals got hammered to the tune of 7-1 by previously winless stuttgart .
st. pauli should give their back four much more time to get sorted , and gladbach have proven they can score goals .
prediction : gladbach 2-0 freiburg – schalke speaking of teams facing must-win situations … schalke .
four games , zero points , and a team that 's yet to gel on the pitch is the sad summation of the royal blues campaign thus far .
meanwhile , freiburg are a surprising fourth in the table , albeit thanks to a couple of lucky results .
schalke have n't had enough time to get their house in order , but a point should be within reach .
prediction : 1-1 nuremberg – stuttgart nuremberg have drawn three of their first four , while stuttgart recovered from an awful start to put seven past gladbach last week .
the club will put up much sturdier resistance , but they may try too hard to get a first win in front of their home fans , which could open opportunities for the swabians .

the message is that talking helps . in response to cases of child abuse within the jesuit order in germany earlier this year , the government in march established the post of an independent commissioner and also set up a telephone hotline for victims to speak about their suffering and seek help .
since then , about 2,500 germans have made contact with her office , said commissioner christine bergmann , adding " some 60 percent of them have never previously talked about what happened to them " .

clerical culprits almost 50 percent of sex abuse cases reported took place in german institutions , primarily in the roman catholic church , as well as on a lesser scale in sports clubs and at schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at berlin 's canisius college , run by jesuits , first cases of abuse were reported in january 2010 some 34 percent of the callers claimed to have been abused within their own families or by acquaintances .
" while the perpetrators were more than 80 percent male , it was surprising to see that almost as many men as women were victims of sexual abuse " , said joerg fegert , director of the ulm university clinic , who heads the team analysing the calls .
clear message fegert said the figures his team compiled with the prior consent of the victims were " far from representative for the entire german population " .
nevertheless the message the victims wanted to send to the general public was " very clear " .
" they believe it 's important to have someone who finally listens to them and believes what they say , " he said .
" compensation is also an issue because it would mean that the victims ' suffering is officially acknowledged . "
a key demand for politics was to make sure that a statute of limitations on sexual abuse was completely abolished , fegert said , because victims ' suffering did n't end after a certain time limit .
raising public awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a telephone hotline has been set up for victims independent commissioner christine bergmann on tuesday also launched a public campaign aimed at ending " decades of ignorance about the issue of sexual abuse in germany " .
a special internet website , as well as newspaper and television advertisements , are intended to publicise the abuse telephone hotline , so that many more victims can " break out of their isolation " .
german filmmaker wim wenders produced a special tv spot entitled : " breaking the silence breaks the power of the perpetrator " .
" ignoring bad things has a long tradition in germany " , wenders said , " but this ignorance perpetuates the trauma and must be ended to prevent cases of sexual abuse from happening again . "
experts ' roundtable round-table talks organized by the german government are scheduled to be held in november to discuss legal issues concerning sexual abuse , as well as medical and financial aid for the victims .
a group of victims who were sexually abused by members of the catholic jesuit order said on monday they would seek compensation payments of more than 80,000 euros -lrb- $ 105,000 -rrb- for each of the 205 victims .
german catholic bishops , currently meeting for their autumn session in fulda , said this sum was hard to imagine , and that they would seek a broader agreement on compensation with the government in november .

the message is that talking helps . in response to cases of child abuse within the jesuit order in germany earlier this year , the government in march established the post of an independent commissioner and also set up a telephone hotline for victims to speak about their suffering and seek help .
since then , about 2,500 germans have made contact with her office , said commissioner christine bergmann , adding " some 60 percent of them have never previously talked about what happened to them " .
on average , the victims were now " in their 50s " , she said , with the abuse having taken place " mostly some 20 , or sometimes even 40 or 50 years ago . "

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .
the proposed code may make a law on the issue redundant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german interior minister hosted the one-day summit in berlin however , de maiziere recognized that such technology can be beneficial , and said he does not want to give people the right to delete images that can be viewed by the public anyway .
he does , however , want service providers to make it clearer how their privacy rights may be infringed by using particular services .
de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "
however , the interior minister wants to lay down a law to draw a " red line , " " which can not be crossed under any circumstances . "
this will be designed to stop particularly extreme violations of privacy .
if the internet companies can not decide on a code by december , de maiziere said the government would immediately intervene in the matter .
the german consumer protection minister ilse aigner welcomed the move as " a good basis , which we can build upon , and which will allow us to take into account the interests of the users . "
she demanded a balance between new technological advances , which can benefit consumers , and the protection of the privacy of individuals .
the head of internet giant google in europe , philipp schindler , also greeted the suggestion with enthusiasm and agreed his company would work with others to draw up the code .
" geo-data from the internet is becoming more important for citizens , authorities and companies , a trend which will grow further with the rise of mobile internet use , " schindler added .

after a less than stellar start , they 'll try to reverse their fortunes by picking the winners and losers correctly this week . match day five in the bundesliga is upon us , and the only ones doing worse than schalke are dw 's team of football freaks .
we pulled off a rare feat last time around and managed to get all the results wrong -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but winners never quit , and quitters never win .
so we 're back at it again for the midweek matches .
here 's goes nothing .
tuesday , september 21 mainz – cologne mainz are topping the table to everyone 's surprise and look like a very solid team with a variety of players who can score .
cologne are doing what they do best and eking enough points to stay just above the relegation zone .
the billy goats held bayern to a scoreless draw in the last round , and they should be able to do the same against mainz .
prediction : 0-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings and bremen will look to get a boot in against hanover hoffenheim – bayern munich hoffenheim are off to a fine start , while bayern have n't scored in their past three matches .
not having arjen robben is a big factor , of course , and ivica olic has yet to find last season 's form .
but no one 's panicking in munich yet , and we think bayern will find their range again on tuesday .
prediction : bayern 2-1 hanover – werder bremen after two wins and a draw , hanover reverted to their meek losing form last weekend , while bremen will be looking for redemption after losing to mainz at home .
both teams are suspect at the back so this could be a real goal-fest , which always favors bremen .
prediction : bremen 4-2 wednesday , september 22 leverkusen – frankfurt frankfurt have looked better than their 1-0-3 record while leverkusen will have to get used to life without stefan kiessling , whose ankle injury will sideline him for the foreseeable future .
put those two things together and what you come out with is a dull draw .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thins have been hunky-dory for the men in yellow dortmund – kaiserslautern dortmund 's main challenge in this match is to get their feet back on the ground after thrashing arch-rivals schalke away on sunday .
kaiserslautern are proving difficult to beat , but then again dortmund , with its huge crowds , is a very difficult place to play , especially for a newly promoted team .
prediction : dortmund 2-1 hamburg – wolfsburg intriguing , intriguing .
there 's was little to like about hamburg 's draw with st. pauli over the weekend – except for mladen petric 's stunning goal .
if petric gets into the line-up , the northern germans should be able to handle the wolves , who have yet to show they can beat a good team .
prediction : hamburg 2-1 moenchengladbach – st. pauli this is a crucial match for gladbach after the foals got hammered to the tune of 7-1 by previously winless stuttgart .
st. pauli should give their back four much more time to get sorted , and gladbach have proven they can score goals .
prediction : gladbach 2-0 freiburg – schalke speaking of teams facing must-win situations … schalke .
four games , zero points , and a team that 's yet to gel on the pitch is the sad summation of the royal blues campaign thus far .
meanwhile , freiburg are a surprising fourth in the table , albeit thanks to a couple of lucky results .
schalke have n't had enough time to get their house in order , but a point should be within reach .
prediction : 1-1 nuremberg – stuttgart nuremberg have drawn three of their first four , while stuttgart recovered from an awful start to put seven past gladbach last week .
the club will put up much sturdier resistance , but they may try too hard to get a first win in front of their home fans , which could open opportunities for the swabians .
prediction : stuttgart 2-1 and now for the really sad part … last week 's result : 0 points frankfurt - freiburg 0-1 -lrb- dw prediction : frankfurt 2-0 -rrb- bayern munich - cologne 0-0 -lrb- dw prediction : bayern 2-0 -rrb- werder bremen - mainz 0-2 -lrb- dw prediction : bremen 3-1 -rrb- stuttgart-moenchengladbach 7-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-1 -rrb- wolfsburg - hanover 2-0 -lrb- dw prediction : 2-2 -rrb- kaiserslautern - hoffenheim 2-2 -lrb- dw prediction : hoffenheim 2-1 -rrb- st. pauli - hamburg 1-1 -lrb- dw prediction : st. pauli 2-1 -rrb- dortmund - schalke 3-1 -lrb- dw prediction : 1-1 -rrb- leverkusen - nuremberg 0-0 -lrb- dw prediction : leverkusen 3-0 -rrb- total for the season : 15 three points for a correct score prediction two points for a correct margin prediction one point for a correct winner prediction author : jefferson chase editor : richard connor jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at this oktoberfest , its hard to tell this year is the 200th anniversary of oktoberfest , but you don ’ t need to go to munich to experience the famous bavarian beer festival .
instead , you could head to sydney , australia at the opposite side of the world . australians tend to enjoy drinking .
they especially like beer in large quantities .
so it 's no wonder they embrace that greatest celebration of beer : oktoberfest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guests seem to enjoy it - no matter what continent they 're on in australia 's largest city , sydney , a number of “ oktoberfest ” celebrations are held across town .
they take place at german breweries , german restaurants , a university campus and pretty much anywhere people are looking for an excuse to imbibe and be merry .
the first venue to kick off the festivities this year was the loewenbraeu keller , a bavarian brewery and restaurant in an area known as the rocks , which is one of the oldest parts of the city and not far from sydney 's famous opera house .
the oktoberfest here at the loewenbraeu began the same weekend as the real event in munich and the festivities also began in the traditional way , with a keg tapping and a subsequent " beer shower " for those standing nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a delicious meal , if you can finish it the room is a smaller version of the famous oktoberfest beer tents .
there are drapes in bavarian blue and white hanging around the room and long wooden tables at which the guests eat and drink their fill .
the waiters and waitresses – most of whom are german or german-speaking – serve the guests with a smile while wearing dirndls and lederhosen , the traditional bavarian dresses and leather pants .
there are traditional bavarian beers imported from germany on offer .
loewenbraeu is available , as well as spaten , hofbraeu and others .
few guests are able to conquer the mountain of food served up by the kitchen : schnitzel , pork knuckle , sausages , bread dumplings and sauerkraut .
the bavarians ' representative reinhard wurtz , the general manager of the loewenbraeu , has been living in australia for ten years .
although originally from lake constance , he says he feels bavarian after serving in the army there and identifying with the culture .
" i think i 'm the right representative for the bavarians , " reinhard says .
he 's certainly getting into the bavarian spirit during oktoberfest , dressed in lederhosen and singing along when the live " oompah " band strikes up a tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loewenbraeu recreates munich 's beer tents reinhard is proud of the authenticity of the loewenbraeu 's oktoberfest , claiming the brewery is the most authentic bavarian beer house outside of bavaria .
he 's even about to head back to munich for this year 's oktoberfest to make sure he stays in touch with how it 's done at home .
" you have to get ideas when you 're away for a long time , " he says .
beer matters to australians most of the guests at the loewenbraeu oktoberfest are local sydneysiders , keen to enjoy some bavarian culture .
one woman says she 's always wanted to go to the real oktoberfest , but has never had the chance .
this is the next best thing , she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelry starts with a traditional keg-tapping others have been to munich and are happy to relive the memories .
but at least one visitor , known in this article as paul – but who also gave his name as steve and peter when asked – is more honest about his reasons for attending .
" the reason we 're out tonight is mainly because beer is very important to australians , " says paul , or steve , or peter .
" it 's also about good looking girls , but mainly it 's about the boys and having a few beers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 21.09.2010 new right-wing parties face major obstacles in both germany and the us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little-known tea party candidate has rocked the republican establishment while the tea party is gaining strength in the us , some conservatives in germany question whether the ruling christian democrats are still conservative enough .
could new right-wing parties emerge in both countries ? the latest shock to the system came for the republican party in the name of christine o 'donnell .
her stunning victory over the establishment-backed candidate in the republican primary in the state of delaware catapulted the tea party activist from obscurity into the limelight .
on the same day , in the new york republican primary , a tea party supporter also beat the candidate favored by the party hierarchy .
their upsets , but also the growing public profile of a movement which has been supported by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin and right-wing talk-show host glenn beck , signal a possible realignment within the conservative political spectrum of the united states .
the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .
unlike most other advanced democracies , germany and the us so far have only one mainstream conservative party .
could that change now with a new right-wing party emerging in both countries ? economic loss while germany and the us share a segment of the electorate that is unhappy with the current situation and the political elite , the chances for a new party to the right of the center to profit from this malaise are vastly different , argue experts .
" what you have in these advanced industrial democracies is a general fear or sense of economic loss and i think this is very justified , " andrei markovits , professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , told deutsche welle .
" the response i may not agree with , but there is clearly a sense of that for the first time maybe the next generation will not be as well off as its parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tea party movement has been supported by fox news talk show host glenn beck however , below the surface of discontent with the conservative mainstream , the constituents of the tea party have a distinct background and motivation that sets them apart from the disenchanted conservatives in germany , notes thomas poguntke , professor for comparative politics at heinrich heine university in duesseldorf .
" i think the religious component of the tea party is a lot stronger than the religious component of the intra-conservative dissent in germany .
i would argue that the german debate within the christian democratic party has a lot to do with that the profile of the christian parties in germany has become a lot more unclear than it was in the past , " he told deutsche welle .
libertarian roots what 's more , says stephen silvia , a comparative politics expert at american university in washington d.c. , " the tea party is a party that is fundamentally a libertarian party .
and when one looks at the german political landscape the party that is ideologically closest to the tea party is not the cdu , but the -lrb- free market-oriented liberal party - ed . -rrb-
fdp . "
while it appears at the moment that the tea party movement stands a much better chance than the disenfranchized german conservatives of having a concrete impact on politics and policies , the likelihood of the tea party becoming a unique political force in the us is next to none .
" in the anglo-american so-called first-past-the-post system it is very difficult to create a successful third party , " says markovits .
" in fact the american history is littered with the graveyard of so-called third parties . "
poguntke concurs that the us two-party system is so strongly entrenched in the way the political system works that the only viable option for dissenting voices is to work through the existing parties .
he adds : " what the tea party movement is about is changing the republican party , pulling it further to the right . "
" it seems to me that the republican party has a very serious issue on its hands , because it basically played with fire , " says markovits .
" they are really the sorceror 's apprentice in that they played with it and then this suddenly became big and endangered the party itself . "
hurdles for new right-wing party in germany due to germany 's electoral system of proportional representation , the structural hurdles for establishing a new party are lower as the rise of the greens and left party has indicated .
but none of the experts interviewed by deutsche welle predicts the emergence of a national party right of the cdu in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the cdu is devoid of conservative voices the switch from a successful movement to a successful party is very difficult , says markovits .
" it 's a totally different gig .
movements can talk , movements have phenomenal voice options , whether they have the same deed options in a very complex parliamentarian system is a completely different story .
if you want to be a player , that 's a very tall order . "
what 's more , says poguntke , " there also is a stronger taboo to mobilize on the right in germany as in most other european countries due to our nazi past . "
in addition , he adds , until now the conservative parties in germany have always been very clever to cover their right-wing flank .
" i think to a certain degree this debate in germany is based on the partially false assumption that there is a huge electorate which is structurally very conservative , " says poguntke . there certainly are conservatives who do n't feel at home in the cdu anymore , he contends . " but this portion of the population is not as big as it used to be . "
for all those reasons , the experts view the battle over the soul of the republican party as the more interesting intra-conservative rumblings .
" the only chance is for the republicans to walk this fine tight rope that they have to moderate and also try to keep these guys , " says markovits .
" whether they can do it , i actually doubt very much because at the moment i do n't see a major republican leader who could do it .
ronald reagan could have . "

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .
the proposed code may make a law on the issue redundant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german interior minister hosted the one-day summit in berlin however , de maiziere recognized that such technology can be beneficial , and said he does not want to give people the right to delete images that can be viewed by the public anyway .
he does , however , want service providers to make it clearer how their privacy rights may be infringed by using particular services .
de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "
however , the interior minister wants to lay down a law to draw a " red line , " " which can not be crossed under any circumstances . "
this will be designed to stop particularly extreme violations of privacy .
if the internet companies can not decide on a code by december , de maiziere said the government would immediately intervene in the matter .
the german consumer protection minister ilse aigner welcomed the move as " a good basis , which we can build upon , and which will allow us to take into account the interests of the users . "
she demanded a balance between new technological advances , which can benefit consumers , and the protection of the privacy of individuals .
the head of internet giant google in europe , philipp schindler , also greeted the suggestion with enthusiasm and agreed his company would work with others to draw up the code .
" geo-data from the internet is becoming more important for citizens , authorities and companies , a trend which will grow further with the rise of mobile internet use , " schindler added .

after a less than stellar start , they 'll try to reverse their fortunes by picking the winners and losers correctly this week . match day five in the bundesliga is upon us , and the only ones doing worse than schalke are dw 's team of football freaks .
we pulled off a rare feat last time around and managed to get all the results wrong -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but winners never quit , and quitters never win .
so we 're back at it again for the midweek matches .
here 's goes nothing .
tuesday , september 21 mainz – cologne mainz are topping the table to everyone 's surprise and look like a very solid team with a variety of players who can score .
cologne are doing what they do best and eking enough points to stay just above the relegation zone .
the billy goats held bayern to a scoreless draw in the last round , and they should be able to do the same against mainz .
prediction : 0-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings and bremen will look to get a boot in against hanover hoffenheim – bayern munich hoffenheim are off to a fine start , while bayern have n't scored in their past three matches .
not having arjen robben is a big factor , of course , and ivica olic has yet to find last season 's form .
but no one 's panicking in munich yet , and we think bayern will find their range again on tuesday .
prediction : bayern 2-1 hanover – werder bremen after two wins and a draw , hanover reverted to their meek losing form last weekend , while bremen will be looking for redemption after losing to mainz at home .
both teams are suspect at the back so this could be a real goal-fest , which always favors bremen .
prediction : bremen 4-2 wednesday , september 22 leverkusen – frankfurt frankfurt have looked better than their 1-0-3 record while leverkusen will have to get used to life without stefan kiessling , whose ankle injury will sideline him for the foreseeable future .
put those two things together and what you come out with is a dull draw .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thins have been hunky-dory for the men in yellow dortmund – kaiserslautern dortmund 's main challenge in this match is to get their feet back on the ground after thrashing arch-rivals schalke away on sunday .
kaiserslautern are proving difficult to beat , but then again dortmund , with its huge crowds , is a very difficult place to play , especially for a newly promoted team .
prediction : dortmund 2-1 hamburg – wolfsburg intriguing , intriguing .
there 's was little to like about hamburg 's draw with st. pauli over the weekend – except for mladen petric 's stunning goal .
if petric gets into the line-up , the northern germans should be able to handle the wolves , who have yet to show they can beat a good team .
prediction : hamburg 2-1 moenchengladbach – st. pauli this is a crucial match for gladbach after the foals got hammered to the tune of 7-1 by previously winless stuttgart .
st. pauli should give their back four much more time to get sorted , and gladbach have proven they can score goals .
prediction : gladbach 2-0 freiburg – schalke speaking of teams facing must-win situations … schalke .
four games , zero points , and a team that 's yet to gel on the pitch is the sad summation of the royal blues campaign thus far .
meanwhile , freiburg are a surprising fourth in the table , albeit thanks to a couple of lucky results .

after a less than stellar start , they 'll try to reverse their fortunes by picking the winners and losers correctly this week . match day five in the bundesliga is upon us , and the only ones doing worse than schalke are dw 's team of football freaks .
we pulled off a rare feat last time around and managed to get all the results wrong -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but winners never quit , and quitters never win .
so we 're back at it again for the midweek matches .
here 's goes nothing .
tuesday , september 21 mainz – cologne mainz are topping the table to everyone 's surprise and look like a very solid team with a variety of players who can score .
cologne are doing what they do best and eking enough points to stay just above the relegation zone .
the billy goats held bayern to a scoreless draw in the last round , and they should be able to do the same against mainz .
prediction : 0-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings and bremen will look to get a boot in against hanover hoffenheim – bayern munich hoffenheim are off to a fine start , while bayern have n't scored in their past three matches .
not having arjen robben is a big factor , of course , and ivica olic has yet to find last season 's form .
but no one 's panicking in munich yet , and we think bayern will find their range again on tuesday .
prediction : bayern 2-1 hanover – werder bremen after two wins and a draw , hanover reverted to their meek losing form last weekend , while bremen will be looking for redemption after losing to mainz at home .
both teams are suspect at the back so this could be a real goal-fest , which always favors bremen .
prediction : bremen 4-2 wednesday , september 22 leverkusen – frankfurt frankfurt have looked better than their 1-0-3 record while leverkusen will have to get used to life without stefan kiessling , whose ankle injury will sideline him for the foreseeable future .
put those two things together and what you come out with is a dull draw .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thins have been hunky-dory for the men in yellow dortmund – kaiserslautern dortmund 's main challenge in this match is to get their feet back on the ground after thrashing arch-rivals schalke away on sunday .
kaiserslautern are proving difficult to beat , but then again dortmund , with its huge crowds , is a very difficult place to play , especially for a newly promoted team .
prediction : dortmund 2-1 hamburg – wolfsburg intriguing , intriguing .
there 's was little to like about hamburg 's draw with st. pauli over the weekend – except for mladen petric 's stunning goal .
if petric gets into the line-up , the northern germans should be able to handle the wolves , who have yet to show they can beat a good team .
prediction : hamburg 2-1 moenchengladbach – st. pauli this is a crucial match for gladbach after the foals got hammered to the tune of 7-1 by previously winless stuttgart .
st. pauli should give their back four much more time to get sorted , and gladbach have proven they can score goals .
prediction : gladbach 2-0 freiburg – schalke speaking of teams facing must-win situations … schalke .
four games , zero points , and a team that 's yet to gel on the pitch is the sad summation of the royal blues campaign thus far .
meanwhile , freiburg are a surprising fourth in the table , albeit thanks to a couple of lucky results .
schalke have n't had enough time to get their house in order , but a point should be within reach .
prediction : 1-1 nuremberg – stuttgart nuremberg have drawn three of their first four , while stuttgart recovered from an awful start to put seven past gladbach last week .
the club will put up much sturdier resistance , but they may try too hard to get a first win in front of their home fans , which could open opportunities for the swabians .

the researchers are presenting their work at a user interface conference in new york next month . while touch screens have existed for decades , multi-touch screens are still a relatively new innovation .
that 's the kind of screen found in the iphone , ipad and other devices .
it allows the user to touch the screen at three or more points , and enables stretching , dragging and other kinds of digital manipulation .
while multi-touch screens are becoming more and more commonplace , german researchers are now working on integrating this same technology into floors .
users would interact with the multi-touch floor by using their feet . "
when i walk across the floor with my shoes , i get a glowing , infrared imprint of my footprints , " explained patrick baudisch , head of the human computer interaction group at the hasso plattner institute in potsdam , germany . " and from that we can reconstruct where people are , and what shoes people wear because the soles are recognizable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multitoe floor would be able to identify users based on their footprints the demonstration model of the " multitoe " floor is about the size of a coffee table and measures about one meter by a half meter , and is raised up off the ground .
the floor itself is made of a thick piece of glass , topped with a black sheet of acrylic .
a camera , built-in to the floor , points up towards the ceiling .
the research team uses a technique called frustrated total internal reflection , that had been developed for use in finger-print scanners , until jeff han from new york university adapted it for use in multi-touch displays .
baudisch and his team hope that a multi-touch floor could be useful as a new way to interact with large amounts of visual data - like maps - or to play video games .
logging into the floor one of the interesting things about the floor is that you can log into it , just like a computer , because it can recognize individuals based on the pattern of their shoes .
when thomas augsten , one of the students working on the project , steps up onto the multi-touch floor , floor asks him a question : who are you ?
augsten taps the word " new " for new user , the floor scans his shoes and he 's given a color .
a keypad then appears on the floor and augsten types in his name with the toe of his shoe , making him a registered user .
while it is possible to type standing on one foot , it would probably be too tiring to write more than a few words .
one of the first challenges the research team had to overcome was how not to interact with the multi-touch floor - it has to be able to differentiate between people just walking around , and understand when they want to interact .
a smart floor could show the way according to johannes schoening , from the german research centre for artificial intelligence in saarbruecken , a touch sensitive floor could open up a whole range of possibilities . "
the main advantage is you can sense what 's going on , on the floor , " he said " but now you have to think about so what can you do with that information .
so for example if you are in the supermarket , you can provide navigational instructions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multitoe floor could be used for large scale visual applications , like maps other examples could include a smart-floor in a museum or an airport that shows you the way - or even a dance club where you can interact with the visuals on the floor .
previously , the sustainable dance club company in the netherlands created a floor that generates power when people walk , jump and dance on it .
it 's fitted with led lights that can change color , but these use as little energy as possible because generating power is the priority .
eric van duin , an engineer with sustainable dance club , said his company is excited about the potential of an interactive floor like the multitoe - just as long as it does n't use too much power . "
our touch experience is very limited , so maybe it would be very interesting to combine these technologies to enhance our dance floor " , he said .
not just entertainment because the multitoe floor has a pressure sensor , baudisch added that potentially it could also be used as a medical tool to analyse posture and assess back problems , or in an assisted living situation .
the floor could sense if people have fallen down and help to increase the safety of inhabitants - without the drawback of visual surveillance . "
we probably would n't like the idea of people installing cameras in our homes , " he said . " and so you could envision something like a touch-sensitive floor that could actually reconstruct bits of your day .
have you gotten up ?
have you gotten some exercise ?
have you dressed ?
we can reconstruct a lot of these things , but without a lot of the privacy implications that a whole camera system has . "
a future of touch-screen interactivity even so , researchers envision a future where multi-touch devices and interactive elements like walls and floors could become a part of our everyday lives - where visual data will migrate between different devices - from an iphone , to a table , or be spread out and manipulated on a multi-touch floor .
still thought , despite the current boom in multi-touch devices , schoening also cautioned that modern society should n't incorporate multi-touch technology into everything just because it 's sexy . he added that designers and application developers should also think about where multi-touch devices are actually needed . "
there are definitely some really crappy examples how we should not use multi-touch , " he said . " do we really need a multi-touch ipod nano when all the thing we can do is rotate the mainscreen ? "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 21.09.2010 new right-wing parties face major obstacles in both germany and the us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little-known tea party candidate has rocked the republican establishment while the tea party is gaining strength in the us , some conservatives in germany question whether the ruling christian democrats are still conservative enough .
could new right-wing parties emerge in both countries ? the latest shock to the system came for the republican party in the name of christine o 'donnell .
her stunning victory over the establishment-backed candidate in the republican primary in the state of delaware catapulted the tea party activist from obscurity into the limelight .
on the same day , in the new york republican primary , a tea party supporter also beat the candidate favored by the party hierarchy .
their upsets , but also the growing public profile of a movement which has been supported by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin and right-wing talk-show host glenn beck , signal a possible realignment within the conservative political spectrum of the united states .
the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .
unlike most other advanced democracies , germany and the us so far have only one mainstream conservative party .
could that change now with a new right-wing party emerging in both countries ? economic loss while germany and the us share a segment of the electorate that is unhappy with the current situation and the political elite , the chances for a new party to the right of the center to profit from this malaise are vastly different , argue experts .
" what you have in these advanced industrial democracies is a general fear or sense of economic loss and i think this is very justified , " andrei markovits , professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , told deutsche welle .
" the response i may not agree with , but there is clearly a sense of that for the first time maybe the next generation will not be as well off as its parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tea party movement has been supported by fox news talk show host glenn beck however , below the surface of discontent with the conservative mainstream , the constituents of the tea party have a distinct background and motivation that sets them apart from the disenchanted conservatives in germany , notes thomas poguntke , professor for comparative politics at heinrich heine university in duesseldorf .
" i think the religious component of the tea party is a lot stronger than the religious component of the intra-conservative dissent in germany .
i would argue that the german debate within the christian democratic party has a lot to do with that the profile of the christian parties in germany has become a lot more unclear than it was in the past , " he told deutsche welle .
libertarian roots what 's more , says stephen silvia , a comparative politics expert at american university in washington d.c. , " the tea party is a party that is fundamentally a libertarian party .
and when one looks at the german political landscape the party that is ideologically closest to the tea party is not the cdu , but the -lrb- free market-oriented liberal party - ed . -rrb-
fdp . "
while it appears at the moment that the tea party movement stands a much better chance than the disenfranchized german conservatives of having a concrete impact on politics and policies , the likelihood of the tea party becoming a unique political force in the us is next to none .
" in the anglo-american so-called first-past-the-post system it is very difficult to create a successful third party , " says markovits .
" in fact the american history is littered with the graveyard of so-called third parties . "
poguntke concurs that the us two-party system is so strongly entrenched in the way the political system works that the only viable option for dissenting voices is to work through the existing parties .
he adds : " what the tea party movement is about is changing the republican party , pulling it further to the right . "
" it seems to me that the republican party has a very serious issue on its hands , because it basically played with fire , " says markovits .
" they are really the sorceror 's apprentice in that they played with it and then this suddenly became big and endangered the party itself . "
hurdles for new right-wing party in germany due to germany 's electoral system of proportional representation , the structural hurdles for establishing a new party are lower as the rise of the greens and left party has indicated .
but none of the experts interviewed by deutsche welle predicts the emergence of a national party right of the cdu in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the cdu is devoid of conservative voices the switch from a successful movement to a successful party is very difficult , says markovits .
" it 's a totally different gig .
movements can talk , movements have phenomenal voice options , whether they have the same deed options in a very complex parliamentarian system is a completely different story .
if you want to be a player , that 's a very tall order . "
what 's more , says poguntke , " there also is a stronger taboo to mobilize on the right in germany as in most other european countries due to our nazi past . "
in addition , he adds , until now the conservative parties in germany have always been very clever to cover their right-wing flank .
" i think to a certain degree this debate in germany is based on the partially false assumption that there is a huge electorate which is structurally very conservative , " says poguntke . there certainly are conservatives who do n't feel at home in the cdu anymore , he contends . " but this portion of the population is not as big as it used to be . "
for all those reasons , the experts view the battle over the soul of the republican party as the more interesting intra-conservative rumblings .
" the only chance is for the republicans to walk this fine tight rope that they have to moderate and also try to keep these guys , " says markovits .
" whether they can do it , i actually doubt very much because at the moment i do n't see a major republican leader who could do it .
ronald reagan could have . "

when thomas augsten , one of the students working on the project , steps up onto the multi-touch floor , floor asks him a question : who are you ?
augsten taps the word " new " for new user , the floor scans his shoes and he 's given a color .
a keypad then appears on the floor and augsten types in his name with the toe of his shoe , making him a registered user .
while it is possible to type standing on one foot , it would probably be too tiring to write more than a few words .
one of the first challenges the research team had to overcome was how not to interact with the multi-touch floor - it has to be able to differentiate between people just walking around , and understand when they want to interact .
a smart floor could show the way according to johannes schoening , from the german research centre for artificial intelligence in saarbruecken , a touch sensitive floor could open up a whole range of possibilities . "
the main advantage is you can sense what 's going on , on the floor , " he said " but now you have to think about so what can you do with that information .
so for example if you are in the supermarket , you can provide navigational instructions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multitoe floor could be used for large scale visual applications , like maps other examples could include a smart-floor in a museum or an airport that shows you the way - or even a dance club where you can interact with the visuals on the floor .
previously , the sustainable dance club company in the netherlands created a floor that generates power when people walk , jump and dance on it .
it 's fitted with led lights that can change color , but these use as little energy as possible because generating power is the priority .
eric van duin , an engineer with sustainable dance club , said his company is excited about the potential of an interactive floor like the multitoe - just as long as it does n't use too much power . "
our touch experience is very limited , so maybe it would be very interesting to combine these technologies to enhance our dance floor " , he said .
not just entertainment because the multitoe floor has a pressure sensor , baudisch added that potentially it could also be used as a medical tool to analyse posture and assess back problems , or in an assisted living situation .
the floor could sense if people have fallen down and help to increase the safety of inhabitants - without the drawback of visual surveillance . "
we probably would n't like the idea of people installing cameras in our homes , " he said . " and so you could envision something like a touch-sensitive floor that could actually reconstruct bits of your day .
have you gotten up ?
have you gotten some exercise ?
have you dressed ?
we can reconstruct a lot of these things , but without a lot of the privacy implications that a whole camera system has . "
a future of touch-screen interactivity even so , researchers envision a future where multi-touch devices and interactive elements like walls and floors could become a part of our everyday lives - where visual data will migrate between different devices - from an iphone , to a table , or be spread out and manipulated on a multi-touch floor .
still thought , despite the current boom in multi-touch devices , schoening also cautioned that modern society should n't incorporate multi-touch technology into everything just because it 's sexy . he added that designers and application developers should also think about where multi-touch devices are actually needed . "
there are definitely some really crappy examples how we should not use multi-touch , " he said . " do we really need a multi-touch ipod nano when all the thing we can do is rotate the mainscreen ? "

they especially like beer in large quantities .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guests seem to enjoy it - no matter what continent they 're on in australia 's largest city , sydney , a number of “ oktoberfest ” celebrations are held across town .
they take place at german breweries , german restaurants , a university campus and pretty much anywhere people are looking for an excuse to imbibe and be merry .
the first venue to kick off the festivities this year was the loewenbraeu keller , a bavarian brewery and restaurant in an area known as the rocks , which is one of the oldest parts of the city and not far from sydney 's famous opera house .
the oktoberfest here at the loewenbraeu began the same weekend as the real event in munich and the festivities also began in the traditional way , with a keg tapping and a subsequent " beer shower " for those standing nearby .

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .
the proposed code may make a law on the issue redundant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german interior minister hosted the one-day summit in berlin however , de maiziere recognized that such technology can be beneficial , and said he does not want to give people the right to delete images that can be viewed by the public anyway .
he does , however , want service providers to make it clearer how their privacy rights may be infringed by using particular services .
de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "
however , the interior minister wants to lay down a law to draw a " red line , " " which can not be crossed under any circumstances . "
this will be designed to stop particularly extreme violations of privacy .
if the internet companies can not decide on a code by december , de maiziere said the government would immediately intervene in the matter .
the german consumer protection minister ilse aigner welcomed the move as " a good basis , which we can build upon , and which will allow us to take into account the interests of the users . "
she demanded a balance between new technological advances , which can benefit consumers , and the protection of the privacy of individuals .
the head of internet giant google in europe , philipp schindler , also greeted the suggestion with enthusiasm and agreed his company would work with others to draw up the code .
" geo-data from the internet is becoming more important for citizens , authorities and companies , a trend which will grow further with the rise of mobile internet use , " schindler added .

the bid will be paid for by a 10.2 billion euro capital increase . investors in postbank will be able to sell their shares to deutsche bank at 25 euros a piece from wednesday .
germany 's financial regulator bafin on tuesday set the price based on a three month average .
deutsche bank already owns 29.95 percent of postbank and is looking to take control of the bank , which has the largest retail network in the country .
tuesday 's announcement applies to the roughly 30 percent of shares owned by various private and institutional investors , known as free float .
those investors have until october 5 to sell their shares .
biggest ever cash call deutsche bank will finance its bid via a capital increase worth 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4bn -rrb- .
on monday , the bank announced it would issue 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros a piece .
investors will be able to buy one new share for every two they already own in what is deutsche bank 's biggest ever cash call to investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post still owns 39.5 percent of postbank the remaining 39.5 percent stake in postbank belongs to deutsche post .
in september 2008 , deutsche post agreed to sell that stake to deutsche bank for 45 euros per share by 2013 .
at the time , postbank 's value was higher and deutsche bank will have to honor that price .
deutsche bank is keen to boost its customer base in germany .
taking over postbank means the combined bank will have 24 million retail clients , more than any other bank in germany .
at present , deutsche bank 's focus is on investment banking .
equity boost the takeover will also help boost deutsche 's capital base .
new global banking rules , known as the basel iii accord , require banks to hold more capital .
the agreement stipulates that banks will have to hold common equity equivalent to at least seven percent of their assets by 2019 .
that is more than triple the two percent required at the moment and is meant to shield banks from another financial crisis by acting as a cushion for potential losses .

the bid will be paid for by a 10.2 billion euro capital increase . investors in postbank will be able to sell their shares to deutsche bank at 25 euros a piece from wednesday .
germany 's financial regulator bafin on tuesday set the price based on a three month average .
deutsche bank already owns 29.95 percent of postbank and is looking to take control of the bank , which has the largest retail network in the country .
tuesday 's announcement applies to the roughly 30 percent of shares owned by various private and institutional investors , known as free float .
those investors have until october 5 to sell their shares .
biggest ever cash call deutsche bank will finance its bid via a capital increase worth 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4bn -rrb- .
on monday , the bank announced it would issue 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros a piece .
investors will be able to buy one new share for every two they already own in what is deutsche bank 's biggest ever cash call to investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post still owns 39.5 percent of postbank the remaining 39.5 percent stake in postbank belongs to deutsche post .
in september 2008 , deutsche post agreed to sell that stake to deutsche bank for 45 euros per share by 2013 .
at the time , postbank 's value was higher and deutsche bank will have to honor that price .
deutsche bank is keen to boost its customer base in germany .
taking over postbank means the combined bank will have 24 million retail clients , more than any other bank in germany .
at present , deutsche bank 's focus is on investment banking .
equity boost the takeover will also help boost deutsche 's capital base .
new global banking rules , known as the basel iii accord , require banks to hold more capital .
the agreement stipulates that banks will have to hold common equity equivalent to at least seven percent of their assets by 2019 .
that is more than triple the two percent required at the moment and is meant to shield banks from another financial crisis by acting as a cushion for potential losses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de computer -pipe- 21.09.2010 multi-touch floor on the way , german researchers say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multi-touch floor could have a login screen like this one from iphone to multi-touch tables , the leap has now been made to a touch-sensitive floor .
the researchers are presenting their work at a user interface conference in new york next month . while touch screens have existed for decades , multi-touch screens are still a relatively new innovation .
that 's the kind of screen found in the iphone , ipad and other devices .
it allows the user to touch the screen at three or more points , and enables stretching , dragging and other kinds of digital manipulation .
while multi-touch screens are becoming more and more commonplace , german researchers are now working on integrating this same technology into floors .
users would interact with the multi-touch floor by using their feet . "
when i walk across the floor with my shoes , i get a glowing , infrared imprint of my footprints , " explained patrick baudisch , head of the human computer interaction group at the hasso plattner institute in potsdam , germany . " and from that we can reconstruct where people are , and what shoes people wear because the soles are recognizable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multitoe floor would be able to identify users based on their footprints the demonstration model of the " multitoe " floor is about the size of a coffee table and measures about one meter by a half meter , and is raised up off the ground .
the floor itself is made of a thick piece of glass , topped with a black sheet of acrylic .
a camera , built-in to the floor , points up towards the ceiling .
the research team uses a technique called frustrated total internal reflection , that had been developed for use in finger-print scanners , until jeff han from new york university adapted it for use in multi-touch displays .
baudisch and his team hope that a multi-touch floor could be useful as a new way to interact with large amounts of visual data - like maps - or to play video games .
logging into the floor one of the interesting things about the floor is that you can log into it , just like a computer , because it can recognize individuals based on the pattern of their shoes .
when thomas augsten , one of the students working on the project , steps up onto the multi-touch floor , floor asks him a question : who are you ?
augsten taps the word " new " for new user , the floor scans his shoes and he 's given a color .
a keypad then appears on the floor and augsten types in his name with the toe of his shoe , making him a registered user .
while it is possible to type standing on one foot , it would probably be too tiring to write more than a few words .
one of the first challenges the research team had to overcome was how not to interact with the multi-touch floor - it has to be able to differentiate between people just walking around , and understand when they want to interact .
a smart floor could show the way according to johannes schoening , from the german research centre for artificial intelligence in saarbruecken , a touch sensitive floor could open up a whole range of possibilities . "
the main advantage is you can sense what 's going on , on the floor , " he said " but now you have to think about so what can you do with that information .
so for example if you are in the supermarket , you can provide navigational instructions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multitoe floor could be used for large scale visual applications , like maps other examples could include a smart-floor in a museum or an airport that shows you the way - or even a dance club where you can interact with the visuals on the floor .
previously , the sustainable dance club company in the netherlands created a floor that generates power when people walk , jump and dance on it .
it 's fitted with led lights that can change color , but these use as little energy as possible because generating power is the priority .
eric van duin , an engineer with sustainable dance club , said his company is excited about the potential of an interactive floor like the multitoe - just as long as it does n't use too much power . "
our touch experience is very limited , so maybe it would be very interesting to combine these technologies to enhance our dance floor " , he said .
not just entertainment because the multitoe floor has a pressure sensor , baudisch added that potentially it could also be used as a medical tool to analyse posture and assess back problems , or in an assisted living situation .
the floor could sense if people have fallen down and help to increase the safety of inhabitants - without the drawback of visual surveillance . "
we probably would n't like the idea of people installing cameras in our homes , " he said . " and so you could envision something like a touch-sensitive floor that could actually reconstruct bits of your day .
have you gotten up ?
have you gotten some exercise ?
have you dressed ?
we can reconstruct a lot of these things , but without a lot of the privacy implications that a whole camera system has . "
a future of touch-screen interactivity even so , researchers envision a future where multi-touch devices and interactive elements like walls and floors could become a part of our everyday lives - where visual data will migrate between different devices - from an iphone , to a table , or be spread out and manipulated on a multi-touch floor .
still thought , despite the current boom in multi-touch devices , schoening also cautioned that modern society should n't incorporate multi-touch technology into everything just because it 's sexy . he added that designers and application developers should also think about where multi-touch devices are actually needed . "
there are definitely some really crappy examples how we should not use multi-touch , " he said . " do we really need a multi-touch ipod nano when all the thing we can do is rotate the mainscreen ? "

merkel said that more conditions should be attached to aid to ensure effective results . chancellor angela merkel has called for the governments of developing nations to take more responsibility in fighting poverty .
the chancellor also said that developed nations should attach tighter conditions to the money they lend and argued in favor of linking the amount to results already achieved .
she said that countries should not rely indefinitely on handouts and had to take charge of their own development . she added social progress was " unthinkable " without good governance and human rights .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit has brought together some 140 world leaders " there is one thing we have to accept , " said merkel .
" the primary responsibility for development lies with the governments of the developing countries .
it is in their hands whether aid can be effective .
therefore , support for good governance is as important as aid itself . "
merkel made her comments at the un general assembly 's special session on the millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- in new york on tuesday , an event attended by some 140 heads of state or government .
they are reviewing the progress of the mdgs agreed 10 years ago to cut poverty , and improve gender quality , health and education .
aid should be used more effectively firm conditions to ensure that money was spent in an effective way should be applied , according to the chancellor .
" development aid can not continue indefinitely .
the task is to use limited resources as effectively as possible . "
" we have to put results-based development aid at center stage , " merkel said .
" it should just only be about money but also about what comes of that money . "
the chancellor added lasting progress on development would require the world to successfully address challenges in four fields - peace and security , poverty reduction , environmental protection and promotion of human rights and good governance .
germany is the third biggest contributor to the un budget and it is one of the largest development aid donors .
potential for german seat on the security council the chancellor is keen for germany to become a non-permanent member of the influential un security council .
she claimed on tuesday that she had received " a lot of support and encouragment " for germany 's bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is hoping germany will get a seat on the un security council a seat on the un 's peacekeeping council would allow germany to " present its views more strongly . "
the new non-permanent members will be elected by the general assemby in october .
however , the aid organization oxfam expressed disappointment in merkel 's speech .
" we expected much more from the german contribution , " oxfam spokeswoman emma seery commented after the speech .
" germany did not say how it will keep its promises to help poorer countries . "
helping women help themselves many experts are concerned that a number of the mdgs on poverty are unlikely to be achieved by the 2015 deadline .
several speakers at the meeting said the goals would not be achieved unless more is done to improve the lives of poor women .
liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf , africa 's first female head of state , called for more investment in sectors that help women , including agriculture and small businesses .
" as we renew our resolve in the year 2010 , we must recognize the need for inclusive economic growth , " she said .
the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , announced that 1 billion euros -lrb- 1.3 billion dollars -rrb- would be given to help africa , the caribbean and pacific countries lagging behind their mdgs .
barroso urged other donors not to use the economic crisis as an excuse to shirk their responsibilities to the poor .
" the international community still has a long way to go before the millennium goals are reached , " he said .

merkel said that more conditions should be attached to aid to ensure effective results . chancellor angela merkel has called for the governments of developing nations to take more responsibility in fighting poverty .
the chancellor also said that developed nations should attach tighter conditions to the money they lend and argued in favor of linking the amount to results already achieved .
she said that countries should not rely indefinitely on handouts and had to take charge of their own development . she added social progress was " unthinkable " without good governance and human rights .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit has brought together some 140 world leaders " there is one thing we have to accept , " said merkel .
" the primary responsibility for development lies with the governments of the developing countries .
it is in their hands whether aid can be effective .
therefore , support for good governance is as important as aid itself . "
merkel made her comments at the un general assembly 's special session on the millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- in new york on tuesday , an event attended by some 140 heads of state or government .
they are reviewing the progress of the mdgs agreed 10 years ago to cut poverty , and improve gender quality , health and education .
aid should be used more effectively firm conditions to ensure that money was spent in an effective way should be applied , according to the chancellor .
" development aid can not continue indefinitely .
the task is to use limited resources as effectively as possible . "
" we have to put results-based development aid at center stage , " merkel said .
" it should just only be about money but also about what comes of that money . "
the chancellor added lasting progress on development would require the world to successfully address challenges in four fields - peace and security , poverty reduction , environmental protection and promotion of human rights and good governance .
germany is the third biggest contributor to the un budget and it is one of the largest development aid donors .
potential for german seat on the security council the chancellor is keen for germany to become a non-permanent member of the influential un security council .
she claimed on tuesday that she had received " a lot of support and encouragment " for germany 's bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is hoping germany will get a seat on the un security council a seat on the un 's peacekeeping council would allow germany to " present its views more strongly . "
the new non-permanent members will be elected by the general assemby in october .
however , the aid organization oxfam expressed disappointment in merkel 's speech .
" we expected much more from the german contribution , " oxfam spokeswoman emma seery commented after the speech .
" germany did not say how it will keep its promises to help poorer countries . "
helping women help themselves many experts are concerned that a number of the mdgs on poverty are unlikely to be achieved by the 2015 deadline .
several speakers at the meeting said the goals would not be achieved unless more is done to improve the lives of poor women .
liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf , africa 's first female head of state , called for more investment in sectors that help women , including agriculture and small businesses .
" as we renew our resolve in the year 2010 , we must recognize the need for inclusive economic growth , " she said .
the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , announced that 1 billion euros -lrb- 1.3 billion dollars -rrb- would be given to help africa , the caribbean and pacific countries lagging behind their mdgs .
barroso urged other donors not to use the economic crisis as an excuse to shirk their responsibilities to the poor .
" the international community still has a long way to go before the millennium goals are reached , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de computer -pipe- 21.09.2010 multi-touch floor on the way , german researchers say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multi-touch floor could have a login screen like this one from iphone to multi-touch tables , the leap has now been made to a touch-sensitive floor .
the researchers are presenting their work at a user interface conference in new york next month . while touch screens have existed for decades , multi-touch screens are still a relatively new innovation .
that 's the kind of screen found in the iphone , ipad and other devices .
it allows the user to touch the screen at three or more points , and enables stretching , dragging and other kinds of digital manipulation .
while multi-touch screens are becoming more and more commonplace , german researchers are now working on integrating this same technology into floors .
users would interact with the multi-touch floor by using their feet . "
when i walk across the floor with my shoes , i get a glowing , infrared imprint of my footprints , " explained patrick baudisch , head of the human computer interaction group at the hasso plattner institute in potsdam , germany . " and from that we can reconstruct where people are , and what shoes people wear because the soles are recognizable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multitoe floor would be able to identify users based on their footprints the demonstration model of the " multitoe " floor is about the size of a coffee table and measures about one meter by a half meter , and is raised up off the ground .
the floor itself is made of a thick piece of glass , topped with a black sheet of acrylic .
a camera , built-in to the floor , points up towards the ceiling .
the research team uses a technique called frustrated total internal reflection , that had been developed for use in finger-print scanners , until jeff han from new york university adapted it for use in multi-touch displays .
baudisch and his team hope that a multi-touch floor could be useful as a new way to interact with large amounts of visual data - like maps - or to play video games .
logging into the floor one of the interesting things about the floor is that you can log into it , just like a computer , because it can recognize individuals based on the pattern of their shoes .
when thomas augsten , one of the students working on the project , steps up onto the multi-touch floor , floor asks him a question : who are you ?
augsten taps the word " new " for new user , the floor scans his shoes and he 's given a color .
a keypad then appears on the floor and augsten types in his name with the toe of his shoe , making him a registered user .
while it is possible to type standing on one foot , it would probably be too tiring to write more than a few words .
one of the first challenges the research team had to overcome was how not to interact with the multi-touch floor - it has to be able to differentiate between people just walking around , and understand when they want to interact .
a smart floor could show the way according to johannes schoening , from the german research centre for artificial intelligence in saarbruecken , a touch sensitive floor could open up a whole range of possibilities . "
the main advantage is you can sense what 's going on , on the floor , " he said " but now you have to think about so what can you do with that information .
so for example if you are in the supermarket , you can provide navigational instructions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multitoe floor could be used for large scale visual applications , like maps other examples could include a smart-floor in a museum or an airport that shows you the way - or even a dance club where you can interact with the visuals on the floor .
previously , the sustainable dance club company in the netherlands created a floor that generates power when people walk , jump and dance on it .
it 's fitted with led lights that can change color , but these use as little energy as possible because generating power is the priority .
eric van duin , an engineer with sustainable dance club , said his company is excited about the potential of an interactive floor like the multitoe - just as long as it does n't use too much power . "
our touch experience is very limited , so maybe it would be very interesting to combine these technologies to enhance our dance floor " , he said .
not just entertainment because the multitoe floor has a pressure sensor , baudisch added that potentially it could also be used as a medical tool to analyse posture and assess back problems , or in an assisted living situation .
the floor could sense if people have fallen down and help to increase the safety of inhabitants - without the drawback of visual surveillance . "
we probably would n't like the idea of people installing cameras in our homes , " he said . " and so you could envision something like a touch-sensitive floor that could actually reconstruct bits of your day .
have you gotten up ?
have you gotten some exercise ?
have you dressed ?
we can reconstruct a lot of these things , but without a lot of the privacy implications that a whole camera system has . "
a future of touch-screen interactivity even so , researchers envision a future where multi-touch devices and interactive elements like walls and floors could become a part of our everyday lives - where visual data will migrate between different devices - from an iphone , to a table , or be spread out and manipulated on a multi-touch floor .
still thought , despite the current boom in multi-touch devices , schoening also cautioned that modern society should n't incorporate multi-touch technology into everything just because it 's sexy . he added that designers and application developers should also think about where multi-touch devices are actually needed . "
there are definitely some really crappy examples how we should not use multi-touch , " he said . " do we really need a multi-touch ipod nano when all the thing we can do is rotate the mainscreen ? "

merkel said that more conditions should be attached to aid to ensure effective results . chancellor angela merkel has called for the governments of developing nations to take more responsibility in fighting poverty .
the chancellor also said that developed nations should attach tighter conditions to the money they lend and argued in favor of linking the amount to results already achieved .

the task is to use limited resources as effectively as possible . "

the bid will be paid for by a 10.2 billion euro capital increase . investors in postbank will be able to sell their shares to deutsche bank at 25 euros a piece from wednesday .
germany 's financial regulator bafin on tuesday set the price based on a three month average .
deutsche bank already owns 29.95 percent of postbank and is looking to take control of the bank , which has the largest retail network in the country .
tuesday 's announcement applies to the roughly 30 percent of shares owned by various private and institutional investors , known as free float .
those investors have until october 5 to sell their shares .
biggest ever cash call deutsche bank will finance its bid via a capital increase worth 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4bn -rrb- .
on monday , the bank announced it would issue 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros a piece .
investors will be able to buy one new share for every two they already own in what is deutsche bank 's biggest ever cash call to investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post still owns 39.5 percent of postbank the remaining 39.5 percent stake in postbank belongs to deutsche post .
in september 2008 , deutsche post agreed to sell that stake to deutsche bank for 45 euros per share by 2013 .
at the time , postbank 's value was higher and deutsche bank will have to honor that price .
deutsche bank is keen to boost its customer base in germany .
taking over postbank means the combined bank will have 24 million retail clients , more than any other bank in germany .
at present , deutsche bank 's focus is on investment banking .
equity boost the takeover will also help boost deutsche 's capital base .
new global banking rules , known as the basel iii accord , require banks to hold more capital .
the agreement stipulates that banks will have to hold common equity equivalent to at least seven percent of their assets by 2019 .
that is more than triple the two percent required at the moment and is meant to shield banks from another financial crisis by acting as a cushion for potential losses .

program guide programs made in germany video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home / dw-tv latinoamerica : made in germany question of the week -pipe- 21.09.2010 would you drive an electric car ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day it may be the most common form of transport .
it is quiet , nimble and practical , and it is powered by environmentally friendly energy .
but it has not yet managed to live up to that promise . what needs to be done to encourage people to drive electric cars ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : joe l. country : usa i bought a new prius back in 2007 , and if there is anything better i will buy it .
as soon as they are perfected i will own an electric car . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : john k. country : canada in my opinion , electric cars will not be the mainstream of transportation , fuels from water or solid " fuels " will be the ultimate energy used . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : ramesh p. country : india electric cars are very good for keeping a green environment .
the main goal for the future would be now to make these cars affordable , so common people can buy them .
but the batteries should be efficient , they should have a long lifespan and a good capacity .
it shouldn ’ t be expensive to have them changed every two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : marcio s. country : brazil my opinion is : while high gas prices and environmental concerns have driven increasing interest in electric cars , that interest has been frustrating since there are no available , fully functioning electric cars on the market .
the reason ?
extraordinarily high battery costs of up to $ 30,000 per vehicle killed the business case for the electric cars test marketed by automakers in the 1990s .
while we 're waiting for better and cheaper batteries to come , there are some limited choices available , if you still want to buy an electric car .
understand that most electric cars are different than conventional vehicles , and consider whether these differences are important to you .
weigh the positive -lrb- zero localized emissions , pennies-per-mile costs , convenient at-home recharging -rrb- and the negative -lrb- high purchase price , limited functionality , unknown resale value -rrb- criteria . it would definitely give us more pleasure to drive electric cars , so let the people know it is easy , let them think about the future of mankind - oil or gas cars will only be a legends , but electric cars are already the future ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : brent d. country : usa instead of relying on batteries that have to be charged by " plugging " them in to an outlet , why not utilize the spinning of the wheels to act as turbines to charge the batteries whenever the car is driven ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : r. mohammad h. country : india given the opportunity , i would drive an electric car .
here in india we do have an electric car available on the market , called reva , but i have not been able to purchase one , because not only is it almost as expensive as a premium small car , but it has also only two seats and a range of only 80 km per charge .
now that the world has finally woken up to the need for electric cars , i can now look forward to one with more choice in terms of price , capacity and range , in the not too distant future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : thorsten d. country : germany no doubt , e-cars will become the normal everyday vehicle in the near future . the most important thing is that a reasonable solution is found for a new type of battery , because for me it seems essential that those should provide a much greater km-range than the actual ones do - let ´ s say at least 300 kilometers .
another point is the design of an e-car .
it seems that for most german car builders they 're only an option to replace the combustion engine with an e-engine .
that 's definitly not the way !
there must be an entirely new concept for e-cars and weight is only one thing to consider .
on the other hand especially german car byers have to change their attitude towards cars : there mustn ´ t be an abundance of power , just as much as is necessary . do we really need to reach 100km / h in , lets say : 6 seconds ?
we just have to learn to be sensitive to this subject . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9797 dw-tv europe live projekt zukunft - das wissenschaftsmagazin we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

a lot of money has been spent on development of the eastern states and the process is not yet finished . things did not go entirely to plan when , on july 1 , 1990 monetary , economic and social union and the deutschmark were introduced in east germany .
citizens of east germany greeted the changes with celebration but for the former socialist republic 's economy the consequences were devastating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall may have fallen , but economic divisions remain bonds and savings up to the value of 6,000 east german marks could be exchanged one-to-one for the deutschmark , but now firms had to pay for salaries in the new west german currency .
overnight , eastern companies were plunged defenselessly into competition with the west german economy - and they could only emerge as losers .
demand for east german products dropped dramatically as citizens simply did not want to buy the familiar old products with their new deutschmarks .
whether it was a basic food , a luxury item , technical equipment or a vehicle - it had to be a product from the west .
no alternative to monetary union experts had anticipated that monetary union would ruin the east german economy .
however , the then west german finance minister theo waigel said there was no alternative in 1990 .
the popular east german call of that year became " if the deutschmark does n't come to us , we will go to the deutschmark ! " and there was already mass immigration to the west .

former west german businesses did indeed sell their products in the east , but these continued to be produced in the west .
industrial jobs in the eastern states emerged only slowly .
even today , the economic output in the former east german states is only 71 percent of the level in the west .
gross domestic product per capita generated by private industry - a standard measure of performance - stands at around 66 percent of that in the west . continued solidarity waigel said that the development of the east had been the greatest act of solidarity to have ever taken place in germany .
he added that this was continuing ; it remains the case that none of the eastern states can finance itself .
according to the current plan of the german government the so called solidarity pact - about sharing the costs of development - is supposed to run until 2019 .

here , close to the equator , the sun sets for most of the year at around 6 in the evening and only rises 12 hours later .
in south american capitals like lima and quito , the population switches the lights on as soon as twilight kicks in .
but that 's not an option in villages up in the andes , most of which are n't connected to electricity grids .
across the planet , 1.6 billion people lack access to electricity , most of them in remote regions , and therefore lead their lives according to the changing of the seasons , sunrise and sunset – a way people in europe and north america stopped living hundreds of years ago .
decentralizing energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-wind hybrid systems are gaining ground the only way to bring electricity to rural areas is to focus on the development of decentralized , renewable energies .
solar panels on the roofs of huts have become a common sight in many developing nations .
these days , micro wind turbines are also becoming increasingly common , capable of covering the energy needs of households and farmsteads as well as being user-friendly and carbon-neutral .
" mini wind turbines are an excellent opportunity for developing nations , " ulf gerder from the german wind energy association -lrb- bwe -rrb- said .
in mongolia , for example , they are often the only source of energy available to nomads .
they carry their super-small wind turbines on the back of their horses .
energy needed for economic progress a reliable energy supply is a prerequisite for economic development . the populations of poor countries often depend for their electricity on diesel generators and batteries , which are costly and environmentally damaging .
mini wind turbines , on the other hand , are an efficient solution in terms both of easing poverty and helping the environment .
an east african ngo called green africa certainly thinks so , and is aiming to make them more common , installing mini wind turbines in villages in countries such as kenya , burundi and rwanda .
" access to electricity has a positive effect on many areas of life , " green africa 's kefa rabah explained .
it allows people to recharge mobile phones , for example , without having to head into a nearby town , which might be many kilometers away .
and in africa , cell phones are often a vital means of communication .
rabah also stressed how much access to electricity improves educational opportunities .
" the children of a goat herd only come home after dark , for example , " he said . " if there is electricity in their home , they can then still spend a few hours reading and doing homework . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the west bank village of susya , locals use solar panels and wind turbines to illuminate their makeshift homes but in fact , mini wind turbines are gaining in popularity not only in developing countries and emerging economies .
in europe and north america , they are seen as an attractive source of sustainable energy , and moreover , as affordable thanks to state subsidies supporting renewable energy infrastructure .
let there be light however , a major drawback to mini wind turbines in germany is that while power generated by a photovoltaic system stored in the grid is worth between 24 and 42 cents per kilowatt-hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- , energy generated by wind power is worth just 9 cents .
" solar and wind power should n't compete , they should complement one another , " gerder from the bwe said . hybrid energy providers that combine solar and wind power are indeed already available .
the winds of change are already blowing in the region of cajamarca in the remote northern highlands of peru .
the ngo " soluciones practicas " has installed mini wind turbines that provide over 4,000 families with a daily supply of electricity amounting to an average 0.3 kilowatts per hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- .
moreover , the organization ensures that every village is home to at least one technician able to repair and maintain the technology . " soluciones practicas " has also set up a training center where young people from all over the world can learn about renewable energy and take their expertise home with them .
micro turbines do n't just provide clean energy , they also offer people in remote regions the chance to be connected to the world .
in peru , the technology has already brought light to some of the darkest corners of the country .

dw-world.de use of wind energy continues to soar around the world clean wind energy is increasing in popularity around the world .
some 82 countries already harness energy from the wind to power homes and towns .
but the technology is still in its infancy in developing nations .
-lrb- 01.06.2010 -rrb- turbines start spinning at germany 's first offshore wind park germany 's first off-shore wind farm has gone into operation tuesday with environment minister norbert roettgen officially starting the 12 turbines constructed in the north sea .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 21.09.2010 new right-wing parties face major obstacles in both germany and the us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little-known tea party candidate has rocked the republican establishment while the tea party is gaining strength in the us , some conservatives in germany question whether the ruling christian democrats are still conservative enough .
could new right-wing parties emerge in both countries ? the latest shock to the system came for the republican party in the name of christine o 'donnell .
her stunning victory over the establishment-backed candidate in the republican primary in the state of delaware catapulted the tea party activist from obscurity into the limelight .
on the same day , in the new york republican primary , a tea party supporter also beat the candidate favored by the party hierarchy .
their upsets , but also the growing public profile of a movement which has been supported by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin and right-wing talk-show host glenn beck , signal a possible realignment within the conservative political spectrum of the united states .
the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .
unlike most other advanced democracies , germany and the us so far have only one mainstream conservative party .
could that change now with a new right-wing party emerging in both countries ? economic loss while germany and the us share a segment of the electorate that is unhappy with the current situation and the political elite , the chances for a new party to the right of the center to profit from this malaise are vastly different , argue experts .
" what you have in these advanced industrial democracies is a general fear or sense of economic loss and i think this is very justified , " andrei markovits , professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , told deutsche welle .
" the response i may not agree with , but there is clearly a sense of that for the first time maybe the next generation will not be as well off as its parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tea party movement has been supported by fox news talk show host glenn beck however , below the surface of discontent with the conservative mainstream , the constituents of the tea party have a distinct background and motivation that sets them apart from the disenchanted conservatives in germany , notes thomas poguntke , professor for comparative politics at heinrich heine university in duesseldorf .
" i think the religious component of the tea party is a lot stronger than the religious component of the intra-conservative dissent in germany .
i would argue that the german debate within the christian democratic party has a lot to do with that the profile of the christian parties in germany has become a lot more unclear than it was in the past , " he told deutsche welle .
libertarian roots what 's more , says stephen silvia , a comparative politics expert at american university in washington d.c. , " the tea party is a party that is fundamentally a libertarian party .
and when one looks at the german political landscape the party that is ideologically closest to the tea party is not the cdu , but the -lrb- free market-oriented liberal party - ed . -rrb-
fdp . "
while it appears at the moment that the tea party movement stands a much better chance than the disenfranchized german conservatives of having a concrete impact on politics and policies , the likelihood of the tea party becoming a unique political force in the us is next to none .
" in the anglo-american so-called first-past-the-post system it is very difficult to create a successful third party , " says markovits .
" in fact the american history is littered with the graveyard of so-called third parties . "
poguntke concurs that the us two-party system is so strongly entrenched in the way the political system works that the only viable option for dissenting voices is to work through the existing parties .
he adds : " what the tea party movement is about is changing the republican party , pulling it further to the right . "
" it seems to me that the republican party has a very serious issue on its hands , because it basically played with fire , " says markovits .
" they are really the sorceror 's apprentice in that they played with it and then this suddenly became big and endangered the party itself . "
hurdles for new right-wing party in germany due to germany 's electoral system of proportional representation , the structural hurdles for establishing a new party are lower as the rise of the greens and left party has indicated .
but none of the experts interviewed by deutsche welle predicts the emergence of a national party right of the cdu in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the cdu is devoid of conservative voices the switch from a successful movement to a successful party is very difficult , says markovits .
" it 's a totally different gig .
movements can talk , movements have phenomenal voice options , whether they have the same deed options in a very complex parliamentarian system is a completely different story .
if you want to be a player , that 's a very tall order . "
what 's more , says poguntke , " there also is a stronger taboo to mobilize on the right in germany as in most other european countries due to our nazi past . "
in addition , he adds , until now the conservative parties in germany have always been very clever to cover their right-wing flank .
" i think to a certain degree this debate in germany is based on the partially false assumption that there is a huge electorate which is structurally very conservative , " says poguntke . there certainly are conservatives who do n't feel at home in the cdu anymore , he contends . " but this portion of the population is not as big as it used to be . "
for all those reasons , the experts view the battle over the soul of the republican party as the more interesting intra-conservative rumblings .
" the only chance is for the republicans to walk this fine tight rope that they have to moderate and also try to keep these guys , " says markovits .
" whether they can do it , i actually doubt very much because at the moment i do n't see a major republican leader who could do it .
ronald reagan could have . "

officials say the two met for informal discussions while at united nations talks in new york . following a meeting on the sidelines of the un millennium summit in new york , the office of french president nicolas sarkozy said that he and german chancellor angela merkel had cleared up a misunderstanding over the issue of france 's roma deportations .
officials said merkel and sarkozy had both been " surprised by the trivial and baseless media controversy , " adding that the two leaders spent a minute discussing the topic during conversations on the sidelines in new york , and another 20 minutes on franco-german cooperation .
sarkozy had said last week that merkel told him she , like him , was planning to clear illegal roma settlements .
however the german government strongly denied she had made such a statement .
there are no reported camps of roma immigrants in germany .
the french president made the comment at an eu summit in brussels as he came under fire for france 's deportation of more than 8,300 romanians and bulgarians , most of them roma .
both leaders are attending the un general assembly 's special session on the millennium development goals in new york .

officials say the two met for informal discussions while at united nations talks in new york . following a meeting on the sidelines of the un millennium summit in new york , the office of french president nicolas sarkozy said that he and german chancellor angela merkel had cleared up a misunderstanding over the issue of france 's roma deportations .
officials said merkel and sarkozy had both been " surprised by the trivial and baseless media controversy , " adding that the two leaders spent a minute discussing the topic during conversations on the sidelines in new york , and another 20 minutes on franco-german cooperation .
sarkozy had said last week that merkel told him she , like him , was planning to clear illegal roma settlements .
however the german government strongly denied she had made such a statement .
there are no reported camps of roma immigrants in germany .
the french president made the comment at an eu summit in brussels as he came under fire for france 's deportation of more than 8,300 romanians and bulgarians , most of them roma .
both leaders are attending the un general assembly 's special session on the millennium development goals in new york .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 21.09.2010 new right-wing parties face major obstacles in both germany and the us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little-known tea party candidate has rocked the republican establishment while the tea party is gaining strength in the us , some conservatives in germany question whether the ruling christian democrats are still conservative enough .
could new right-wing parties emerge in both countries ? the latest shock to the system came for the republican party in the name of christine o 'donnell .
her stunning victory over the establishment-backed candidate in the republican primary in the state of delaware catapulted the tea party activist from obscurity into the limelight .
on the same day , in the new york republican primary , a tea party supporter also beat the candidate favored by the party hierarchy .
their upsets , but also the growing public profile of a movement which has been supported by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin and right-wing talk-show host glenn beck , signal a possible realignment within the conservative political spectrum of the united states .
the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .
unlike most other advanced democracies , germany and the us so far have only one mainstream conservative party .
could that change now with a new right-wing party emerging in both countries ? economic loss while germany and the us share a segment of the electorate that is unhappy with the current situation and the political elite , the chances for a new party to the right of the center to profit from this malaise are vastly different , argue experts .
" what you have in these advanced industrial democracies is a general fear or sense of economic loss and i think this is very justified , " andrei markovits , professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , told deutsche welle .
" the response i may not agree with , but there is clearly a sense of that for the first time maybe the next generation will not be as well off as its parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tea party movement has been supported by fox news talk show host glenn beck however , below the surface of discontent with the conservative mainstream , the constituents of the tea party have a distinct background and motivation that sets them apart from the disenchanted conservatives in germany , notes thomas poguntke , professor for comparative politics at heinrich heine university in duesseldorf .
" i think the religious component of the tea party is a lot stronger than the religious component of the intra-conservative dissent in germany .
i would argue that the german debate within the christian democratic party has a lot to do with that the profile of the christian parties in germany has become a lot more unclear than it was in the past , " he told deutsche welle .
libertarian roots what 's more , says stephen silvia , a comparative politics expert at american university in washington d.c. , " the tea party is a party that is fundamentally a libertarian party .
and when one looks at the german political landscape the party that is ideologically closest to the tea party is not the cdu , but the -lrb- free market-oriented liberal party - ed . -rrb-
fdp . "
while it appears at the moment that the tea party movement stands a much better chance than the disenfranchized german conservatives of having a concrete impact on politics and policies , the likelihood of the tea party becoming a unique political force in the us is next to none .
" in the anglo-american so-called first-past-the-post system it is very difficult to create a successful third party , " says markovits .
" in fact the american history is littered with the graveyard of so-called third parties . "
poguntke concurs that the us two-party system is so strongly entrenched in the way the political system works that the only viable option for dissenting voices is to work through the existing parties .
he adds : " what the tea party movement is about is changing the republican party , pulling it further to the right . "
" it seems to me that the republican party has a very serious issue on its hands , because it basically played with fire , " says markovits .
" they are really the sorceror 's apprentice in that they played with it and then this suddenly became big and endangered the party itself . "
hurdles for new right-wing party in germany due to germany 's electoral system of proportional representation , the structural hurdles for establishing a new party are lower as the rise of the greens and left party has indicated .
but none of the experts interviewed by deutsche welle predicts the emergence of a national party right of the cdu in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the cdu is devoid of conservative voices the switch from a successful movement to a successful party is very difficult , says markovits .
" it 's a totally different gig .
movements can talk , movements have phenomenal voice options , whether they have the same deed options in a very complex parliamentarian system is a completely different story .
if you want to be a player , that 's a very tall order . "
what 's more , says poguntke , " there also is a stronger taboo to mobilize on the right in germany as in most other european countries due to our nazi past . "
in addition , he adds , until now the conservative parties in germany have always been very clever to cover their right-wing flank .
" i think to a certain degree this debate in germany is based on the partially false assumption that there is a huge electorate which is structurally very conservative , " says poguntke . there certainly are conservatives who do n't feel at home in the cdu anymore , he contends . " but this portion of the population is not as big as it used to be . "
for all those reasons , the experts view the battle over the soul of the republican party as the more interesting intra-conservative rumblings .
" the only chance is for the republicans to walk this fine tight rope that they have to moderate and also try to keep these guys , " says markovits .
" whether they can do it , i actually doubt very much because at the moment i do n't see a major republican leader who could do it .
ronald reagan could have . "

at this oktoberfest , its hard to tell this year is the 200th anniversary of oktoberfest , but you don ’ t need to go to munich to experience the famous bavarian beer festival .
instead , you could head to sydney , australia at the opposite side of the world . australians tend to enjoy drinking .
they especially like beer in large quantities .
so it 's no wonder they embrace that greatest celebration of beer : oktoberfest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guests seem to enjoy it - no matter what continent they 're on in australia 's largest city , sydney , a number of “ oktoberfest ” celebrations are held across town .
they take place at german breweries , german restaurants , a university campus and pretty much anywhere people are looking for an excuse to imbibe and be merry .
the first venue to kick off the festivities this year was the loewenbraeu keller , a bavarian brewery and restaurant in an area known as the rocks , which is one of the oldest parts of the city and not far from sydney 's famous opera house .
the oktoberfest here at the loewenbraeu began the same weekend as the real event in munich and the festivities also began in the traditional way , with a keg tapping and a subsequent " beer shower " for those standing nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a delicious meal , if you can finish it the room is a smaller version of the famous oktoberfest beer tents .
there are drapes in bavarian blue and white hanging around the room and long wooden tables at which the guests eat and drink their fill .
the waiters and waitresses – most of whom are german or german-speaking – serve the guests with a smile while wearing dirndls and lederhosen , the traditional bavarian dresses and leather pants .
there are traditional bavarian beers imported from germany on offer .
loewenbraeu is available , as well as spaten , hofbraeu and others .
few guests are able to conquer the mountain of food served up by the kitchen : schnitzel , pork knuckle , sausages , bread dumplings and sauerkraut .
the bavarians ' representative reinhard wurtz , the general manager of the loewenbraeu , has been living in australia for ten years .
although originally from lake constance , he says he feels bavarian after serving in the army there and identifying with the culture .
" i think i 'm the right representative for the bavarians , " reinhard says .
he 's certainly getting into the bavarian spirit during oktoberfest , dressed in lederhosen and singing along when the live " oompah " band strikes up a tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loewenbraeu recreates munich 's beer tents reinhard is proud of the authenticity of the loewenbraeu 's oktoberfest , claiming the brewery is the most authentic bavarian beer house outside of bavaria .
he 's even about to head back to munich for this year 's oktoberfest to make sure he stays in touch with how it 's done at home .
" you have to get ideas when you 're away for a long time , " he says .
beer matters to australians most of the guests at the loewenbraeu oktoberfest are local sydneysiders , keen to enjoy some bavarian culture .
one woman says she 's always wanted to go to the real oktoberfest , but has never had the chance .
this is the next best thing , she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelry starts with a traditional keg-tapping others have been to munich and are happy to relive the memories .
but at least one visitor , known in this article as paul – but who also gave his name as steve and peter when asked – is more honest about his reasons for attending .
" the reason we 're out tonight is mainly because beer is very important to australians , " says paul , or steve , or peter .
" it 's also about good looking girls , but mainly it 's about the boys and having a few beers . "

the french interior minister says the country is facing a " real terrorist threat . " the security level in france has been heightened after receiving intelligence that there was a threat of a possible suicide attack .
the tip-off came from algerian intelligence services and the potential bomber was thought to be a woman targeting either the paris metro transport system or a public gathering place .
" the terrorism threat is real , we have increased our vigilance , " said interior minister brice hortefeux on monday , without giving any specific details .
the heightened alert follows last tuesday 's ban on the wearing of the islamic face veil in public and recent military action against suspected islamic militants in north africa .
niger kidnappings authorities have warned an attack was increasingly possible since july when french soldiers were involved in a raid on an al qaeda camp in mali .

as a result of the french action , aqim assassinated a 78-year-old french engineer who they took hostage in niger .
in addition , five french nationals were kidnapped in niger last week , reportedly by aqim .
the head of france 's counter intelligence service , bernard squarcini , has appeared in several interviews recently evoking the heightened alert , telling le monde on sunday : " carrying out an attack on our territory is among their objectives . "
authorities have visibly boosted police and military units patrolling landmarks , including the eiffel tower , where 2,000 people were evacuated last week after a hoax bomb threat .

the french interior minister says the country is facing a " real terrorist threat . " the security level in france has been heightened after receiving intelligence that there was a threat of a possible suicide attack .
the tip-off came from algerian intelligence services and the potential bomber was thought to be a woman targeting either the paris metro transport system or a public gathering place .
" the terrorism threat is real , we have increased our vigilance , " said interior minister brice hortefeux on monday , without giving any specific details .
the heightened alert follows last tuesday 's ban on the wearing of the islamic face veil in public and recent military action against suspected islamic militants in north africa .
niger kidnappings authorities have warned an attack was increasingly possible since july when french soldiers were involved in a raid on an al qaeda camp in mali .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security has been boosted in public after al qaeda threats the north african wing of al qaeda , or al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- have warned they will kill french citizens in revenge for fighters killed in the raid .
as a result of the french action , aqim assassinated a 78-year-old french engineer who they took hostage in niger .
in addition , five french nationals were kidnapped in niger last week , reportedly by aqim .
the head of france 's counter intelligence service , bernard squarcini , has appeared in several interviews recently evoking the heightened alert , telling le monde on sunday : " carrying out an attack on our territory is among their objectives . "
authorities have visibly boosted police and military units patrolling landmarks , including the eiffel tower , where 2,000 people were evacuated last week after a hoax bomb threat .

milli gorus ' general secretary said the process had a " political background . " the munich prosecutor has dropped all serious charges against top officials of the muslim group milli gorus and several other muslim organizations .
six officials had been charged with fraud , money laundering , the support of terrorist organizations and association with criminals .
in the spring of 2009 there were extensive raids .
according to the german daily newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung , the 19 month investigations into the groups have been discontinued .
the general secretary of the organization , olaz ucuncu said he suspected there was a " political background " to the investigation .
the investigators " found nothing , " he said .

ucuncu told the sueddeutsche zeitung that it is unlikely that milli gorus will wish to take part in future islam conferences organized by the government .
there are an estimated four million muslims living in germany , most of them with turkish roots .
the milli gorus group started in turkey and now has a nationwide presence in germany in over 300 mosques .

at this oktoberfest , its hard to tell this year is the 200th anniversary of oktoberfest , but you don ’ t need to go to munich to experience the famous bavarian beer festival .
instead , you could head to sydney , australia at the opposite side of the world . australians tend to enjoy drinking .
they especially like beer in large quantities .
so it 's no wonder they embrace that greatest celebration of beer : oktoberfest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guests seem to enjoy it - no matter what continent they 're on in australia 's largest city , sydney , a number of “ oktoberfest ” celebrations are held across town .
they take place at german breweries , german restaurants , a university campus and pretty much anywhere people are looking for an excuse to imbibe and be merry .
the first venue to kick off the festivities this year was the loewenbraeu keller , a bavarian brewery and restaurant in an area known as the rocks , which is one of the oldest parts of the city and not far from sydney 's famous opera house .
the oktoberfest here at the loewenbraeu began the same weekend as the real event in munich and the festivities also began in the traditional way , with a keg tapping and a subsequent " beer shower " for those standing nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a delicious meal , if you can finish it the room is a smaller version of the famous oktoberfest beer tents .
there are drapes in bavarian blue and white hanging around the room and long wooden tables at which the guests eat and drink their fill .
the waiters and waitresses – most of whom are german or german-speaking – serve the guests with a smile while wearing dirndls and lederhosen , the traditional bavarian dresses and leather pants .
there are traditional bavarian beers imported from germany on offer .
loewenbraeu is available , as well as spaten , hofbraeu and others .
few guests are able to conquer the mountain of food served up by the kitchen : schnitzel , pork knuckle , sausages , bread dumplings and sauerkraut .
the bavarians ' representative reinhard wurtz , the general manager of the loewenbraeu , has been living in australia for ten years .
although originally from lake constance , he says he feels bavarian after serving in the army there and identifying with the culture .
" i think i 'm the right representative for the bavarians , " reinhard says .
he 's certainly getting into the bavarian spirit during oktoberfest , dressed in lederhosen and singing along when the live " oompah " band strikes up a tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loewenbraeu recreates munich 's beer tents reinhard is proud of the authenticity of the loewenbraeu 's oktoberfest , claiming the brewery is the most authentic bavarian beer house outside of bavaria .
he 's even about to head back to munich for this year 's oktoberfest to make sure he stays in touch with how it 's done at home .
" you have to get ideas when you 're away for a long time , " he says .
beer matters to australians most of the guests at the loewenbraeu oktoberfest are local sydneysiders , keen to enjoy some bavarian culture .
one woman says she 's always wanted to go to the real oktoberfest , but has never had the chance .
this is the next best thing , she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelry starts with a traditional keg-tapping others have been to munich and are happy to relive the memories .
but at least one visitor , known in this article as paul – but who also gave his name as steve and peter when asked – is more honest about his reasons for attending .
" the reason we 're out tonight is mainly because beer is very important to australians , " says paul , or steve , or peter .
" it 's also about good looking girls , but mainly it 's about the boys and having a few beers . "

could new right-wing parties emerge in both countries ? the latest shock to the system came for the republican party in the name of christine o 'donnell .
her stunning victory over the establishment-backed candidate in the republican primary in the state of delaware catapulted the tea party activist from obscurity into the limelight .
on the same day , in the new york republican primary , a tea party supporter also beat the candidate favored by the party hierarchy .
their upsets , but also the growing public profile of a movement which has been supported by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin and right-wing talk-show host glenn beck , signal a possible realignment within the conservative political spectrum of the united states .
the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .
unlike most other advanced democracies , germany and the us so far have only one mainstream conservative party .
could that change now with a new right-wing party emerging in both countries ? economic loss while germany and the us share a segment of the electorate that is unhappy with the current situation and the political elite , the chances for a new party to the right of the center to profit from this malaise are vastly different , argue experts .
" what you have in these advanced industrial democracies is a general fear or sense of economic loss and i think this is very justified , " andrei markovits , professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , told deutsche welle .
" the response i may not agree with , but there is clearly a sense of that for the first time maybe the next generation will not be as well off as its parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tea party movement has been supported by fox news talk show host glenn beck however , below the surface of discontent with the conservative mainstream , the constituents of the tea party have a distinct background and motivation that sets them apart from the disenchanted conservatives in germany , notes thomas poguntke , professor for comparative politics at heinrich heine university in duesseldorf .
" i think the religious component of the tea party is a lot stronger than the religious component of the intra-conservative dissent in germany .
i would argue that the german debate within the christian democratic party has a lot to do with that the profile of the christian parties in germany has become a lot more unclear than it was in the past , " he told deutsche welle .
libertarian roots what 's more , says stephen silvia , a comparative politics expert at american university in washington d.c. , " the tea party is a party that is fundamentally a libertarian party .
and when one looks at the german political landscape the party that is ideologically closest to the tea party is not the cdu , but the -lrb- free market-oriented liberal party - ed . -rrb-
fdp . "
while it appears at the moment that the tea party movement stands a much better chance than the disenfranchized german conservatives of having a concrete impact on politics and policies , the likelihood of the tea party becoming a unique political force in the us is next to none .
" in the anglo-american so-called first-past-the-post system it is very difficult to create a successful third party , " says markovits .
" in fact the american history is littered with the graveyard of so-called third parties . "
poguntke concurs that the us two-party system is so strongly entrenched in the way the political system works that the only viable option for dissenting voices is to work through the existing parties .
he adds : " what the tea party movement is about is changing the republican party , pulling it further to the right . "
" it seems to me that the republican party has a very serious issue on its hands , because it basically played with fire , " says markovits .
" they are really the sorceror 's apprentice in that they played with it and then this suddenly became big and endangered the party itself . "
hurdles for new right-wing party in germany due to germany 's electoral system of proportional representation , the structural hurdles for establishing a new party are lower as the rise of the greens and left party has indicated .
but none of the experts interviewed by deutsche welle predicts the emergence of a national party right of the cdu in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the cdu is devoid of conservative voices the switch from a successful movement to a successful party is very difficult , says markovits .
" it 's a totally different gig .
movements can talk , movements have phenomenal voice options , whether they have the same deed options in a very complex parliamentarian system is a completely different story .
if you want to be a player , that 's a very tall order . "
what 's more , says poguntke , " there also is a stronger taboo to mobilize on the right in germany as in most other european countries due to our nazi past . "
in addition , he adds , until now the conservative parties in germany have always been very clever to cover their right-wing flank .
" i think to a certain degree this debate in germany is based on the partially false assumption that there is a huge electorate which is structurally very conservative , " says poguntke . there certainly are conservatives who do n't feel at home in the cdu anymore , he contends . " but this portion of the population is not as big as it used to be . "
for all those reasons , the experts view the battle over the soul of the republican party as the more interesting intra-conservative rumblings .
" the only chance is for the republicans to walk this fine tight rope that they have to moderate and also try to keep these guys , " says markovits .
" whether they can do it , i actually doubt very much because at the moment i do n't see a major republican leader who could do it .
ronald reagan could have . "

" the success of the euro depends on all euro area countries seriously engaging with the responsibilities that go hand in hand with the considerable benefits that euro area membership offers , " trichet said .
prices in estonia are already being displayed in euros as well as estonian kroons and there will be a two week period of dual circulation before the kroon ceases to become legal tender .
although the eu has approved a rescue fund for european states in danger of a debt crisis - worth 440 billion euros -lrb- $ 575 billion -rrb- - there are fresh fears about high levels of borrowing in greece , ireland and portugal .

at this oktoberfest , its hard to tell this year is the 200th anniversary of oktoberfest , but you don ’ t need to go to munich to experience the famous bavarian beer festival .
instead , you could head to sydney , australia at the opposite side of the world . australians tend to enjoy drinking .
they especially like beer in large quantities .
so it 's no wonder they embrace that greatest celebration of beer : oktoberfest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guests seem to enjoy it - no matter what continent they 're on in australia 's largest city , sydney , a number of “ oktoberfest ” celebrations are held across town .
they take place at german breweries , german restaurants , a university campus and pretty much anywhere people are looking for an excuse to imbibe and be merry .
the first venue to kick off the festivities this year was the loewenbraeu keller , a bavarian brewery and restaurant in an area known as the rocks , which is one of the oldest parts of the city and not far from sydney 's famous opera house .
the oktoberfest here at the loewenbraeu began the same weekend as the real event in munich and the festivities also began in the traditional way , with a keg tapping and a subsequent " beer shower " for those standing nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a delicious meal , if you can finish it the room is a smaller version of the famous oktoberfest beer tents .
there are drapes in bavarian blue and white hanging around the room and long wooden tables at which the guests eat and drink their fill .
the waiters and waitresses – most of whom are german or german-speaking – serve the guests with a smile while wearing dirndls and lederhosen , the traditional bavarian dresses and leather pants .
there are traditional bavarian beers imported from germany on offer .
loewenbraeu is available , as well as spaten , hofbraeu and others .
few guests are able to conquer the mountain of food served up by the kitchen : schnitzel , pork knuckle , sausages , bread dumplings and sauerkraut .
the bavarians ' representative reinhard wurtz , the general manager of the loewenbraeu , has been living in australia for ten years .
although originally from lake constance , he says he feels bavarian after serving in the army there and identifying with the culture .
" i think i 'm the right representative for the bavarians , " reinhard says .
he 's certainly getting into the bavarian spirit during oktoberfest , dressed in lederhosen and singing along when the live " oompah " band strikes up a tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loewenbraeu recreates munich 's beer tents reinhard is proud of the authenticity of the loewenbraeu 's oktoberfest , claiming the brewery is the most authentic bavarian beer house outside of bavaria .
he 's even about to head back to munich for this year 's oktoberfest to make sure he stays in touch with how it 's done at home .
" you have to get ideas when you 're away for a long time , " he says .
beer matters to australians most of the guests at the loewenbraeu oktoberfest are local sydneysiders , keen to enjoy some bavarian culture .
one woman says she 's always wanted to go to the real oktoberfest , but has never had the chance .
this is the next best thing , she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelry starts with a traditional keg-tapping others have been to munich and are happy to relive the memories .
but at least one visitor , known in this article as paul – but who also gave his name as steve and peter when asked – is more honest about his reasons for attending .
" the reason we 're out tonight is mainly because beer is very important to australians , " says paul , or steve , or peter .
" it 's also about good looking girls , but mainly it 's about the boys and having a few beers . "

at this oktoberfest , its hard to tell this year is the 200th anniversary of oktoberfest , but you don ’ t need to go to munich to experience the famous bavarian beer festival .
instead , you could head to sydney , australia at the opposite side of the world . australians tend to enjoy drinking .
they especially like beer in large quantities .
so it 's no wonder they embrace that greatest celebration of beer : oktoberfest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guests seem to enjoy it - no matter what continent they 're on in australia 's largest city , sydney , a number of “ oktoberfest ” celebrations are held across town .
they take place at german breweries , german restaurants , a university campus and pretty much anywhere people are looking for an excuse to imbibe and be merry .
the first venue to kick off the festivities this year was the loewenbraeu keller , a bavarian brewery and restaurant in an area known as the rocks , which is one of the oldest parts of the city and not far from sydney 's famous opera house .
the oktoberfest here at the loewenbraeu began the same weekend as the real event in munich and the festivities also began in the traditional way , with a keg tapping and a subsequent " beer shower " for those standing nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a delicious meal , if you can finish it the room is a smaller version of the famous oktoberfest beer tents .
there are drapes in bavarian blue and white hanging around the room and long wooden tables at which the guests eat and drink their fill .
the waiters and waitresses – most of whom are german or german-speaking – serve the guests with a smile while wearing dirndls and lederhosen , the traditional bavarian dresses and leather pants .
there are traditional bavarian beers imported from germany on offer .
loewenbraeu is available , as well as spaten , hofbraeu and others .
few guests are able to conquer the mountain of food served up by the kitchen : schnitzel , pork knuckle , sausages , bread dumplings and sauerkraut .
the bavarians ' representative reinhard wurtz , the general manager of the loewenbraeu , has been living in australia for ten years .
although originally from lake constance , he says he feels bavarian after serving in the army there and identifying with the culture .
" i think i 'm the right representative for the bavarians , " reinhard says .
he 's certainly getting into the bavarian spirit during oktoberfest , dressed in lederhosen and singing along when the live " oompah " band strikes up a tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loewenbraeu recreates munich 's beer tents reinhard is proud of the authenticity of the loewenbraeu 's oktoberfest , claiming the brewery is the most authentic bavarian beer house outside of bavaria .
he 's even about to head back to munich for this year 's oktoberfest to make sure he stays in touch with how it 's done at home .
" you have to get ideas when you 're away for a long time , " he says .
beer matters to australians most of the guests at the loewenbraeu oktoberfest are local sydneysiders , keen to enjoy some bavarian culture .
one woman says she 's always wanted to go to the real oktoberfest , but has never had the chance .
this is the next best thing , she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelry starts with a traditional keg-tapping others have been to munich and are happy to relive the memories .
but at least one visitor , known in this article as paul – but who also gave his name as steve and peter when asked – is more honest about his reasons for attending .
" the reason we 're out tonight is mainly because beer is very important to australians , " says paul , or steve , or peter .
" it 's also about good looking girls , but mainly it 's about the boys and having a few beers . "

we pulled off a rare feat last time around and managed to get all the results wrong -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but winners never quit , and quitters never win .
so we 're back at it again for the midweek matches .
here 's goes nothing .
tuesday , september 21 mainz – cologne mainz are topping the table to everyone 's surprise and look like a very solid team with a variety of players who can score .
cologne are doing what they do best and eking enough points to stay just above the relegation zone .
the billy goats held bayern to a scoreless draw in the last round , and they should be able to do the same against mainz .
prediction : 0-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings and bremen will look to get a boot in against hanover hoffenheim – bayern munich hoffenheim are off to a fine start , while bayern have n't scored in their past three matches .
not having arjen robben is a big factor , of course , and ivica olic has yet to find last season 's form .
but no one 's panicking in munich yet , and we think bayern will find their range again on tuesday .
prediction : bayern 2-1 hanover – werder bremen after two wins and a draw , hanover reverted to their meek losing form last weekend , while bremen will be looking for redemption after losing to mainz at home .
both teams are suspect at the back so this could be a real goal-fest , which always favors bremen .
prediction : bremen 4-2 wednesday , september 22 leverkusen – frankfurt frankfurt have looked better than their 1-0-3 record while leverkusen will have to get used to life without stefan kiessling , whose ankle injury will sideline him for the foreseeable future .
put those two things together and what you come out with is a dull draw .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thins have been hunky-dory for the men in yellow dortmund – kaiserslautern dortmund 's main challenge in this match is to get their feet back on the ground after thrashing arch-rivals schalke away on sunday .
kaiserslautern are proving difficult to beat , but then again dortmund , with its huge crowds , is a very difficult place to play , especially for a newly promoted team .
prediction : dortmund 2-1 hamburg – wolfsburg intriguing , intriguing .
there 's was little to like about hamburg 's draw with st. pauli over the weekend – except for mladen petric 's stunning goal .
if petric gets into the line-up , the northern germans should be able to handle the wolves , who have yet to show they can beat a good team .
prediction : hamburg 2-1 moenchengladbach – st. pauli this is a crucial match for gladbach after the foals got hammered to the tune of 7-1 by previously winless stuttgart .
st. pauli should give their back four much more time to get sorted , and gladbach have proven they can score goals .
prediction : gladbach 2-0 freiburg – schalke speaking of teams facing must-win situations … schalke .
four games , zero points , and a team that 's yet to gel on the pitch is the sad summation of the royal blues campaign thus far .
meanwhile , freiburg are a surprising fourth in the table , albeit thanks to a couple of lucky results .
schalke have n't had enough time to get their house in order , but a point should be within reach .
prediction : 1-1 nuremberg – stuttgart nuremberg have drawn three of their first four , while stuttgart recovered from an awful start to put seven past gladbach last week .
the club will put up much sturdier resistance , but they may try too hard to get a first win in front of their home fans , which could open opportunities for the swabians .

however , he said , rules must be strictly observed . european central bank president jean-claude trichet has hailed the efforts of estonia in edging closer to joining the eurozone .
trichet said on monday that the fact that the baltic state had qualified showed that the currency bloc still had room to expand , despite recent concerns over the integrity of the currency .
estonia is due to become the eurozone 's 17th member on january 1 .
trichet said this showed that " that the euro area is not a ' closed shop ' but is open to those countries and economies that are fully compliant with the entry criteria in a convincing and sustainable manner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro will be circulate alongside the kroon for two weeks trichet used an address in the estonian capital tallinn to repeat calls to strengthen the eurozone 's foundations and avoid the possibility of a new sovereign debt crisis , similar to that in greece earlier this year .
" the success of the euro depends on all euro area countries seriously engaging with the responsibilities that go hand in hand with the considerable benefits that euro area membership offers , " trichet said .
prices in estonia are already being displayed in euros as well as estonian kroons and there will be a two week period of dual circulation before the kroon ceases to become legal tender .
although the eu has approved a rescue fund for european states in danger of a debt crisis - worth 440 billion euros -lrb- $ 575 billion -rrb- - there are fresh fears about high levels of borrowing in greece , ireland and portugal .

at this oktoberfest , its hard to tell this year is the 200th anniversary of oktoberfest , but you don ’ t need to go to munich to experience the famous bavarian beer festival .
instead , you could head to sydney , australia at the opposite side of the world . australians tend to enjoy drinking .
they especially like beer in large quantities .
so it 's no wonder they embrace that greatest celebration of beer : oktoberfest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guests seem to enjoy it - no matter what continent they 're on in australia 's largest city , sydney , a number of “ oktoberfest ” celebrations are held across town .
they take place at german breweries , german restaurants , a university campus and pretty much anywhere people are looking for an excuse to imbibe and be merry .
the first venue to kick off the festivities this year was the loewenbraeu keller , a bavarian brewery and restaurant in an area known as the rocks , which is one of the oldest parts of the city and not far from sydney 's famous opera house .
the oktoberfest here at the loewenbraeu began the same weekend as the real event in munich and the festivities also began in the traditional way , with a keg tapping and a subsequent " beer shower " for those standing nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a delicious meal , if you can finish it the room is a smaller version of the famous oktoberfest beer tents .
there are drapes in bavarian blue and white hanging around the room and long wooden tables at which the guests eat and drink their fill .
the waiters and waitresses – most of whom are german or german-speaking – serve the guests with a smile while wearing dirndls and lederhosen , the traditional bavarian dresses and leather pants .
there are traditional bavarian beers imported from germany on offer .
loewenbraeu is available , as well as spaten , hofbraeu and others .
few guests are able to conquer the mountain of food served up by the kitchen : schnitzel , pork knuckle , sausages , bread dumplings and sauerkraut .
the bavarians ' representative reinhard wurtz , the general manager of the loewenbraeu , has been living in australia for ten years .
although originally from lake constance , he says he feels bavarian after serving in the army there and identifying with the culture .
" i think i 'm the right representative for the bavarians , " reinhard says .
he 's certainly getting into the bavarian spirit during oktoberfest , dressed in lederhosen and singing along when the live " oompah " band strikes up a tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loewenbraeu recreates munich 's beer tents reinhard is proud of the authenticity of the loewenbraeu 's oktoberfest , claiming the brewery is the most authentic bavarian beer house outside of bavaria .
he 's even about to head back to munich for this year 's oktoberfest to make sure he stays in touch with how it 's done at home .
" you have to get ideas when you 're away for a long time , " he says .
beer matters to australians most of the guests at the loewenbraeu oktoberfest are local sydneysiders , keen to enjoy some bavarian culture .
one woman says she 's always wanted to go to the real oktoberfest , but has never had the chance .
this is the next best thing , she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelry starts with a traditional keg-tapping others have been to munich and are happy to relive the memories .
but at least one visitor , known in this article as paul – but who also gave his name as steve and peter when asked – is more honest about his reasons for attending .
" the reason we 're out tonight is mainly because beer is very important to australians , " says paul , or steve , or peter .
" it 's also about good looking girls , but mainly it 's about the boys and having a few beers . "

officials say the two met for informal discussions while at united nations talks in new york . following a meeting on the sidelines of the un millennium summit in new york , the office of french president nicolas sarkozy said that he and german chancellor angela merkel had cleared up a misunderstanding over the issue of france 's roma deportations .
officials said merkel and sarkozy had both been " surprised by the trivial and baseless media controversy , " adding that the two leaders spent a minute discussing the topic during conversations on the sidelines in new york , and another 20 minutes on franco-german cooperation .
sarkozy had said last week that merkel told him she , like him , was planning to clear illegal roma settlements .
however the german government strongly denied she had made such a statement .
there are no reported camps of roma immigrants in germany .
the french president made the comment at an eu summit in brussels as he came under fire for france 's deportation of more than 8,300 romanians and bulgarians , most of them roma .
both leaders are attending the un general assembly 's special session on the millennium development goals in new york .

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .
the proposed code may make a law on the issue redundant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german interior minister hosted the one-day summit in berlin however , de maiziere recognized that such technology can be beneficial , and said he does not want to give people the right to delete images that can be viewed by the public anyway .
he does , however , want service providers to make it clearer how their privacy rights may be infringed by using particular services .
de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "
however , the interior minister wants to lay down a law to draw a " red line , " " which can not be crossed under any circumstances . "
this will be designed to stop particularly extreme violations of privacy .
if the internet companies can not decide on a code by december , de maiziere said the government would immediately intervene in the matter .
the german consumer protection minister ilse aigner welcomed the move as " a good basis , which we can build upon , and which will allow us to take into account the interests of the users . "
she demanded a balance between new technological advances , which can benefit consumers , and the protection of the privacy of individuals .
the head of internet giant google in europe , philipp schindler , also greeted the suggestion with enthusiasm and agreed his company would work with others to draw up the code .
" geo-data from the internet is becoming more important for citizens , authorities and companies , a trend which will grow further with the rise of mobile internet use , " schindler added .

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .
the proposed code may make a law on the issue redundant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german interior minister hosted the one-day summit in berlin however , de maiziere recognized that such technology can be beneficial , and said he does not want to give people the right to delete images that can be viewed by the public anyway .
he does , however , want service providers to make it clearer how their privacy rights may be infringed by using particular services .
de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "
however , the interior minister wants to lay down a law to draw a " red line , " " which can not be crossed under any circumstances . "
this will be designed to stop particularly extreme violations of privacy .
if the internet companies can not decide on a code by december , de maiziere said the government would immediately intervene in the matter .
the german consumer protection minister ilse aigner welcomed the move as " a good basis , which we can build upon , and which will allow us to take into account the interests of the users . "
she demanded a balance between new technological advances , which can benefit consumers , and the protection of the privacy of individuals .
the head of internet giant google in europe , philipp schindler , also greeted the suggestion with enthusiasm and agreed his company would work with others to draw up the code .
" geo-data from the internet is becoming more important for citizens , authorities and companies , a trend which will grow further with the rise of mobile internet use , " schindler added .

however , he said , rules must be strictly observed . european central bank president jean-claude trichet has hailed the efforts of estonia in edging closer to joining the eurozone .
trichet said on monday that the fact that the baltic state had qualified showed that the currency bloc still had room to expand , despite recent concerns over the integrity of the currency .
estonia is due to become the eurozone 's 17th member on january 1 .
trichet said this showed that " that the euro area is not a ' closed shop ' but is open to those countries and economies that are fully compliant with the entry criteria in a convincing and sustainable manner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro will be circulate alongside the kroon for two weeks trichet used an address in the estonian capital tallinn to repeat calls to strengthen the eurozone 's foundations and avoid the possibility of a new sovereign debt crisis , similar to that in greece earlier this year .
" the success of the euro depends on all euro area countries seriously engaging with the responsibilities that go hand in hand with the considerable benefits that euro area membership offers , " trichet said .
prices in estonia are already being displayed in euros as well as estonian kroons and there will be a two week period of dual circulation before the kroon ceases to become legal tender .
although the eu has approved a rescue fund for european states in danger of a debt crisis - worth 440 billion euros -lrb- $ 575 billion -rrb- - there are fresh fears about high levels of borrowing in greece , ireland and portugal .

a lot of money has been spent on development of the eastern states and the process is not yet finished . things did not go entirely to plan when , on july 1 , 1990 monetary , economic and social union and the deutschmark were introduced in east germany .
citizens of east germany greeted the changes with celebration but for the former socialist republic 's economy the consequences were devastating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall may have fallen , but economic divisions remain bonds and savings up to the value of 6,000 east german marks could be exchanged one-to-one for the deutschmark , but now firms had to pay for salaries in the new west german currency .
overnight , eastern companies were plunged defenselessly into competition with the west german economy - and they could only emerge as losers .
demand for east german products dropped dramatically as citizens simply did not want to buy the familiar old products with their new deutschmarks .
whether it was a basic food , a luxury item , technical equipment or a vehicle - it had to be a product from the west .
no alternative to monetary union experts had anticipated that monetary union would ruin the east german economy .
however , the then west german finance minister theo waigel said there was no alternative in 1990 .
the popular east german call of that year became " if the deutschmark does n't come to us , we will go to the deutschmark ! " and there was already mass immigration to the west .
" in the finance ministry at the time we discussed all theoretical possibilities , step-by step plans and ways to make the situation better . " said waigel .
" but introducing these plans would not have helped .
it would have been like putting up another wall in germany . "

former west german businesses did indeed sell their products in the east , but these continued to be produced in the west .
industrial jobs in the eastern states emerged only slowly .
even today , the economic output in the former east german states is only 71 percent of the level in the west .
gross domestic product per capita generated by private industry - a standard measure of performance - stands at around 66 percent of that in the west . continued solidarity waigel said that the development of the east had been the greatest act of solidarity to have ever taken place in germany .
he added that this was continuing ; it remains the case that none of the eastern states can finance itself .
according to the current plan of the german government the so called solidarity pact - about sharing the costs of development - is supposed to run until 2019 .

the researchers are presenting their work at a user interface conference in new york next month . while touch screens have existed for decades , multi-touch screens are still a relatively new innovation .
that 's the kind of screen found in the iphone , ipad and other devices .
it allows the user to touch the screen at three or more points , and enables stretching , dragging and other kinds of digital manipulation .
while multi-touch screens are becoming more and more commonplace , german researchers are now working on integrating this same technology into floors .
users would interact with the multi-touch floor by using their feet . "
when i walk across the floor with my shoes , i get a glowing , infrared imprint of my footprints , " explained patrick baudisch , head of the human computer interaction group at the hasso plattner institute in potsdam , germany . " and from that we can reconstruct where people are , and what shoes people wear because the soles are recognizable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multitoe floor would be able to identify users based on their footprints the demonstration model of the " multitoe " floor is about the size of a coffee table and measures about one meter by a half meter , and is raised up off the ground .

here , close to the equator , the sun sets for most of the year at around 6 in the evening and only rises 12 hours later .
in south american capitals like lima and quito , the population switches the lights on as soon as twilight kicks in .
but that 's not an option in villages up in the andes , most of which are n't connected to electricity grids .
across the planet , 1.6 billion people lack access to electricity , most of them in remote regions , and therefore lead their lives according to the changing of the seasons , sunrise and sunset – a way people in europe and north america stopped living hundreds of years ago .
decentralizing energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-wind hybrid systems are gaining ground the only way to bring electricity to rural areas is to focus on the development of decentralized , renewable energies .
solar panels on the roofs of huts have become a common sight in many developing nations .
these days , micro wind turbines are also becoming increasingly common , capable of covering the energy needs of households and farmsteads as well as being user-friendly and carbon-neutral .
" mini wind turbines are an excellent opportunity for developing nations , " ulf gerder from the german wind energy association -lrb- bwe -rrb- said .
in mongolia , for example , they are often the only source of energy available to nomads .
they carry their super-small wind turbines on the back of their horses .
energy needed for economic progress a reliable energy supply is a prerequisite for economic development . the populations of poor countries often depend for their electricity on diesel generators and batteries , which are costly and environmentally damaging .
mini wind turbines , on the other hand , are an efficient solution in terms both of easing poverty and helping the environment .
an east african ngo called green africa certainly thinks so , and is aiming to make them more common , installing mini wind turbines in villages in countries such as kenya , burundi and rwanda .
" access to electricity has a positive effect on many areas of life , " green africa 's kefa rabah explained .
it allows people to recharge mobile phones , for example , without having to head into a nearby town , which might be many kilometers away .
and in africa , cell phones are often a vital means of communication .
rabah also stressed how much access to electricity improves educational opportunities .
" the children of a goat herd only come home after dark , for example , " he said . " if there is electricity in their home , they can then still spend a few hours reading and doing homework . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the west bank village of susya , locals use solar panels and wind turbines to illuminate their makeshift homes but in fact , mini wind turbines are gaining in popularity not only in developing countries and emerging economies .
in europe and north america , they are seen as an attractive source of sustainable energy , and moreover , as affordable thanks to state subsidies supporting renewable energy infrastructure .
let there be light however , a major drawback to mini wind turbines in germany is that while power generated by a photovoltaic system stored in the grid is worth between 24 and 42 cents per kilowatt-hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- , energy generated by wind power is worth just 9 cents .
" solar and wind power should n't compete , they should complement one another , " gerder from the bwe said . hybrid energy providers that combine solar and wind power are indeed already available .
the winds of change are already blowing in the region of cajamarca in the remote northern highlands of peru .
the ngo " soluciones practicas " has installed mini wind turbines that provide over 4,000 families with a daily supply of electricity amounting to an average 0.3 kilowatts per hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- .
moreover , the organization ensures that every village is home to at least one technician able to repair and maintain the technology . " soluciones practicas " has also set up a training center where young people from all over the world can learn about renewable energy and take their expertise home with them .
micro turbines do n't just provide clean energy , they also offer people in remote regions the chance to be connected to the world .
in peru , the technology has already brought light to some of the darkest corners of the country .

dw-world.de use of wind energy continues to soar around the world clean wind energy is increasing in popularity around the world .
some 82 countries already harness energy from the wind to power homes and towns .
but the technology is still in its infancy in developing nations .
-lrb- 01.06.2010 -rrb- turbines start spinning at germany 's first offshore wind park germany 's first off-shore wind farm has gone into operation tuesday with environment minister norbert roettgen officially starting the 12 turbines constructed in the north sea .
-lrb- 27.04.2010 -rrb- the answer to clean living may be blowing in the wind wind power currently meets eight percent of national energy needs .
much of that comes from huge turbines at wind farms , but experts are now predicting major growth in a diminutive version of the same thing .

could new right-wing parties emerge in both countries ? the latest shock to the system came for the republican party in the name of christine o 'donnell .
her stunning victory over the establishment-backed candidate in the republican primary in the state of delaware catapulted the tea party activist from obscurity into the limelight .
on the same day , in the new york republican primary , a tea party supporter also beat the candidate favored by the party hierarchy .
their upsets , but also the growing public profile of a movement which has been supported by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin and right-wing talk-show host glenn beck , signal a possible realignment within the conservative political spectrum of the united states .
the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .
unlike most other advanced democracies , germany and the us so far have only one mainstream conservative party .
could that change now with a new right-wing party emerging in both countries ? economic loss while germany and the us share a segment of the electorate that is unhappy with the current situation and the political elite , the chances for a new party to the right of the center to profit from this malaise are vastly different , argue experts .
" what you have in these advanced industrial democracies is a general fear or sense of economic loss and i think this is very justified , " andrei markovits , professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , told deutsche welle .
" the response i may not agree with , but there is clearly a sense of that for the first time maybe the next generation will not be as well off as its parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tea party movement has been supported by fox news talk show host glenn beck however , below the surface of discontent with the conservative mainstream , the constituents of the tea party have a distinct background and motivation that sets them apart from the disenchanted conservatives in germany , notes thomas poguntke , professor for comparative politics at heinrich heine university in duesseldorf .
" i think the religious component of the tea party is a lot stronger than the religious component of the intra-conservative dissent in germany .
i would argue that the german debate within the christian democratic party has a lot to do with that the profile of the christian parties in germany has become a lot more unclear than it was in the past , " he told deutsche welle .
libertarian roots what 's more , says stephen silvia , a comparative politics expert at american university in washington d.c. , " the tea party is a party that is fundamentally a libertarian party .
and when one looks at the german political landscape the party that is ideologically closest to the tea party is not the cdu , but the -lrb- free market-oriented liberal party - ed . -rrb-
fdp . "
while it appears at the moment that the tea party movement stands a much better chance than the disenfranchized german conservatives of having a concrete impact on politics and policies , the likelihood of the tea party becoming a unique political force in the us is next to none .
" in the anglo-american so-called first-past-the-post system it is very difficult to create a successful third party , " says markovits .
" in fact the american history is littered with the graveyard of so-called third parties . "
poguntke concurs that the us two-party system is so strongly entrenched in the way the political system works that the only viable option for dissenting voices is to work through the existing parties .
he adds : " what the tea party movement is about is changing the republican party , pulling it further to the right . "
" it seems to me that the republican party has a very serious issue on its hands , because it basically played with fire , " says markovits .
" they are really the sorceror 's apprentice in that they played with it and then this suddenly became big and endangered the party itself . "
hurdles for new right-wing party in germany due to germany 's electoral system of proportional representation , the structural hurdles for establishing a new party are lower as the rise of the greens and left party has indicated .
but none of the experts interviewed by deutsche welle predicts the emergence of a national party right of the cdu in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the cdu is devoid of conservative voices the switch from a successful movement to a successful party is very difficult , says markovits .
" it 's a totally different gig .
movements can talk , movements have phenomenal voice options , whether they have the same deed options in a very complex parliamentarian system is a completely different story .
if you want to be a player , that 's a very tall order . "
what 's more , says poguntke , " there also is a stronger taboo to mobilize on the right in germany as in most other european countries due to our nazi past . "
in addition , he adds , until now the conservative parties in germany have always been very clever to cover their right-wing flank .
" i think to a certain degree this debate in germany is based on the partially false assumption that there is a huge electorate which is structurally very conservative , " says poguntke . there certainly are conservatives who do n't feel at home in the cdu anymore , he contends . " but this portion of the population is not as big as it used to be . "
for all those reasons , the experts view the battle over the soul of the republican party as the more interesting intra-conservative rumblings .
" the only chance is for the republicans to walk this fine tight rope that they have to moderate and also try to keep these guys , " says markovits .
" whether they can do it , i actually doubt very much because at the moment i do n't see a major republican leader who could do it .
ronald reagan could have . "

the researchers are presenting their work at a user interface conference in new york next month . while touch screens have existed for decades , multi-touch screens are still a relatively new innovation .
that 's the kind of screen found in the iphone , ipad and other devices .
it allows the user to touch the screen at three or more points , and enables stretching , dragging and other kinds of digital manipulation .
while multi-touch screens are becoming more and more commonplace , german researchers are now working on integrating this same technology into floors .
users would interact with the multi-touch floor by using their feet . "
when i walk across the floor with my shoes , i get a glowing , infrared imprint of my footprints , " explained patrick baudisch , head of the human computer interaction group at the hasso plattner institute in potsdam , germany . " and from that we can reconstruct where people are , and what shoes people wear because the soles are recognizable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multitoe floor would be able to identify users based on their footprints the demonstration model of the " multitoe " floor is about the size of a coffee table and measures about one meter by a half meter , and is raised up off the ground .
the floor itself is made of a thick piece of glass , topped with a black sheet of acrylic .
a camera , built-in to the floor , points up towards the ceiling .
the research team uses a technique called frustrated total internal reflection , that had been developed for use in finger-print scanners , until jeff han from new york university adapted it for use in multi-touch displays .
baudisch and his team hope that a multi-touch floor could be useful as a new way to interact with large amounts of visual data - like maps - or to play video games .
logging into the floor one of the interesting things about the floor is that you can log into it , just like a computer , because it can recognize individuals based on the pattern of their shoes .
when thomas augsten , one of the students working on the project , steps up onto the multi-touch floor , floor asks him a question : who are you ?
augsten taps the word " new " for new user , the floor scans his shoes and he 's given a color .
a keypad then appears on the floor and augsten types in his name with the toe of his shoe , making him a registered user .
while it is possible to type standing on one foot , it would probably be too tiring to write more than a few words .
one of the first challenges the research team had to overcome was how not to interact with the multi-touch floor - it has to be able to differentiate between people just walking around , and understand when they want to interact .
a smart floor could show the way according to johannes schoening , from the german research centre for artificial intelligence in saarbruecken , a touch sensitive floor could open up a whole range of possibilities . "
the main advantage is you can sense what 's going on , on the floor , " he said " but now you have to think about so what can you do with that information .
so for example if you are in the supermarket , you can provide navigational instructions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multitoe floor could be used for large scale visual applications , like maps other examples could include a smart-floor in a museum or an airport that shows you the way - or even a dance club where you can interact with the visuals on the floor .
previously , the sustainable dance club company in the netherlands created a floor that generates power when people walk , jump and dance on it .
it 's fitted with led lights that can change color , but these use as little energy as possible because generating power is the priority .
eric van duin , an engineer with sustainable dance club , said his company is excited about the potential of an interactive floor like the multitoe - just as long as it does n't use too much power . "
our touch experience is very limited , so maybe it would be very interesting to combine these technologies to enhance our dance floor " , he said .
not just entertainment because the multitoe floor has a pressure sensor , baudisch added that potentially it could also be used as a medical tool to analyse posture and assess back problems , or in an assisted living situation .
the floor could sense if people have fallen down and help to increase the safety of inhabitants - without the drawback of visual surveillance . "
we probably would n't like the idea of people installing cameras in our homes , " he said . " and so you could envision something like a touch-sensitive floor that could actually reconstruct bits of your day .
have you gotten up ?
have you gotten some exercise ?
have you dressed ?
we can reconstruct a lot of these things , but without a lot of the privacy implications that a whole camera system has . "
a future of touch-screen interactivity even so , researchers envision a future where multi-touch devices and interactive elements like walls and floors could become a part of our everyday lives - where visual data will migrate between different devices - from an iphone , to a table , or be spread out and manipulated on a multi-touch floor .
still thought , despite the current boom in multi-touch devices , schoening also cautioned that modern society should n't incorporate multi-touch technology into everything just because it 's sexy . he added that designers and application developers should also think about where multi-touch devices are actually needed . "
there are definitely some really crappy examples how we should not use multi-touch , " he said . " do we really need a multi-touch ipod nano when all the thing we can do is rotate the mainscreen ? "

energy needed for economic progress a reliable energy supply is a prerequisite for economic development . the populations of poor countries often depend for their electricity on diesel generators and batteries , which are costly and environmentally damaging .
mini wind turbines , on the other hand , are an efficient solution in terms both of easing poverty and helping the environment .
an east african ngo called green africa certainly thinks so , and is aiming to make them more common , installing mini wind turbines in villages in countries such as kenya , burundi and rwanda .
" access to electricity has a positive effect on many areas of life , " green africa 's kefa rabah explained .
it allows people to recharge mobile phones , for example , without having to head into a nearby town , which might be many kilometers away .
and in africa , cell phones are often a vital means of communication .

let there be light however , a major drawback to mini wind turbines in germany is that while power generated by a photovoltaic system stored in the grid is worth between 24 and 42 cents per kilowatt-hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- , energy generated by wind power is worth just 9 cents .

across the planet , 1.6 billion people lack access to electricity , most of them in remote regions , and therefore lead their lives according to the changing of the seasons , sunrise and sunset – a way people in europe and north america stopped living hundreds of years ago .
decentralizing energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-wind hybrid systems are gaining ground the only way to bring electricity to rural areas is to focus on the development of decentralized , renewable energies .
solar panels on the roofs of huts have become a common sight in many developing nations .
these days , micro wind turbines are also becoming increasingly common , capable of covering the energy needs of households and farmsteads as well as being user-friendly and carbon-neutral .
" mini wind turbines are an excellent opportunity for developing nations , " ulf gerder from the german wind energy association -lrb- bwe -rrb- said .
in mongolia , for example , they are often the only source of energy available to nomads .
they carry their super-small wind turbines on the back of their horses .
energy needed for economic progress a reliable energy supply is a prerequisite for economic development . the populations of poor countries often depend for their electricity on diesel generators and batteries , which are costly and environmentally damaging .
mini wind turbines , on the other hand , are an efficient solution in terms both of easing poverty and helping the environment .
an east african ngo called green africa certainly thinks so , and is aiming to make them more common , installing mini wind turbines in villages in countries such as kenya , burundi and rwanda .
" access to electricity has a positive effect on many areas of life , " green africa 's kefa rabah explained .
it allows people to recharge mobile phones , for example , without having to head into a nearby town , which might be many kilometers away .
and in africa , cell phones are often a vital means of communication .
rabah also stressed how much access to electricity improves educational opportunities .
" the children of a goat herd only come home after dark , for example , " he said . " if there is electricity in their home , they can then still spend a few hours reading and doing homework . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the west bank village of susya , locals use solar panels and wind turbines to illuminate their makeshift homes but in fact , mini wind turbines are gaining in popularity not only in developing countries and emerging economies .
in europe and north america , they are seen as an attractive source of sustainable energy , and moreover , as affordable thanks to state subsidies supporting renewable energy infrastructure .
let there be light however , a major drawback to mini wind turbines in germany is that while power generated by a photovoltaic system stored in the grid is worth between 24 and 42 cents per kilowatt-hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- , energy generated by wind power is worth just 9 cents .
" solar and wind power should n't compete , they should complement one another , " gerder from the bwe said . hybrid energy providers that combine solar and wind power are indeed already available .
the winds of change are already blowing in the region of cajamarca in the remote northern highlands of peru .
the ngo " soluciones practicas " has installed mini wind turbines that provide over 4,000 families with a daily supply of electricity amounting to an average 0.3 kilowatts per hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- .
moreover , the organization ensures that every village is home to at least one technician able to repair and maintain the technology . " soluciones practicas " has also set up a training center where young people from all over the world can learn about renewable energy and take their expertise home with them .
micro turbines do n't just provide clean energy , they also offer people in remote regions the chance to be connected to the world .
in peru , the technology has already brought light to some of the darkest corners of the country .

dw-world.de use of wind energy continues to soar around the world clean wind energy is increasing in popularity around the world .
some 82 countries already harness energy from the wind to power homes and towns .
but the technology is still in its infancy in developing nations .
-lrb- 01.06.2010 -rrb- turbines start spinning at germany 's first off-shore wind park germany 's first off-shore wind farm has gone into operation tuesday with environment minister norbert roettgen officially starting the 12 turbines constructed in the north sea .
-lrb- 27.04.2010 -rrb- the answer to clean living may be blowing in the wind wind power currently meets eight percent of national energy needs .
much of that comes from huge turbines at wind farms , but experts are now predicting major growth in a diminutive version of the same thing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de computer -pipe- 21.09.2010 multi-touch floor on the way , german researchers say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multi-touch floor could have a login screen like this one from iphone to multi-touch tables , the leap has now been made to a touch-sensitive floor .
the researchers are presenting their work at a user interface conference in new york next month . while touch screens have existed for decades , multi-touch screens are still a relatively new innovation .
that 's the kind of screen found in the iphone , ipad and other devices .
it allows the user to touch the screen at three or more points , and enables stretching , dragging and other kinds of digital manipulation .
while multi-touch screens are becoming more and more commonplace , german researchers are now working on integrating this same technology into floors .
users would interact with the multi-touch floor by using their feet . "
when i walk across the floor with my shoes , i get a glowing , infrared imprint of my footprints , " explained patrick baudisch , head of the human computer interaction group at the hasso plattner institute in potsdam , germany . " and from that we can reconstruct where people are , and what shoes people wear because the soles are recognizable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multitoe floor would be able to identify users based on their footprints the demonstration model of the " multitoe " floor is about the size of a coffee table and measures about one meter by a half meter , and is raised up off the ground .
the floor itself is made of a thick piece of glass , topped with a black sheet of acrylic .
a camera , built-in to the floor , points up towards the ceiling .
the research team uses a technique called frustrated total internal reflection , that had been developed for use in finger-print scanners , until jeff han from new york university adapted it for use in multi-touch displays .
baudisch and his team hope that a multi-touch floor could be useful as a new way to interact with large amounts of visual data - like maps - or to play video games .
logging into the floor one of the interesting things about the floor is that you can log into it , just like a computer , because it can recognize individuals based on the pattern of their shoes .
when thomas augsten , one of the students working on the project , steps up onto the multi-touch floor , floor asks him a question : who are you ?
augsten taps the word " new " for new user , the floor scans his shoes and he 's given a color .
a keypad then appears on the floor and augsten types in his name with the toe of his shoe , making him a registered user .
while it is possible to type standing on one foot , it would probably be too tiring to write more than a few words .
one of the first challenges the research team had to overcome was how not to interact with the multi-touch floor - it has to be able to differentiate between people just walking around , and understand when they want to interact .
a smart floor could show the way according to johannes schoening , from the german research centre for artificial intelligence in saarbruecken , a touch sensitive floor could open up a whole range of possibilities . "
the main advantage is you can sense what 's going on , on the floor , " he said " but now you have to think about so what can you do with that information .
so for example if you are in the supermarket , you can provide navigational instructions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multitoe floor could be used for large scale visual applications , like maps other examples could include a smart-floor in a museum or an airport that shows you the way - or even a dance club where you can interact with the visuals on the floor .
previously , the sustainable dance club company in the netherlands created a floor that generates power when people walk , jump and dance on it .
it 's fitted with led lights that can change color , but these use as little energy as possible because generating power is the priority .
eric van duin , an engineer with sustainable dance club , said his company is excited about the potential of an interactive floor like the multitoe - just as long as it does n't use too much power . "
our touch experience is very limited , so maybe it would be very interesting to combine these technologies to enhance our dance floor " , he said .
not just entertainment because the multitoe floor has a pressure sensor , baudisch added that potentially it could also be used as a medical tool to analyse posture and assess back problems , or in an assisted living situation .
the floor could sense if people have fallen down and help to increase the safety of inhabitants - without the drawback of visual surveillance . "
we probably would n't like the idea of people installing cameras in our homes , " he said . " and so you could envision something like a touch-sensitive floor that could actually reconstruct bits of your day .
have you gotten up ?
have you gotten some exercise ?
have you dressed ?
we can reconstruct a lot of these things , but without a lot of the privacy implications that a whole camera system has . "
a future of touch-screen interactivity even so , researchers envision a future where multi-touch devices and interactive elements like walls and floors could become a part of our everyday lives - where visual data will migrate between different devices - from an iphone , to a table , or be spread out and manipulated on a multi-touch floor .
still thought , despite the current boom in multi-touch devices , schoening also cautioned that modern society should n't incorporate multi-touch technology into everything just because it 's sexy . he added that designers and application developers should also think about where multi-touch devices are actually needed . "
there are definitely some really crappy examples how we should not use multi-touch , " he said . " do we really need a multi-touch ipod nano when all the thing we can do is rotate the mainscreen ? "

the bid will be paid for by a 10.2 billion euro capital increase . investors in postbank will be able to sell their shares to deutsche bank at 25 euros a piece from wednesday .
germany 's financial regulator bafin on tuesday set the price based on a three month average .
deutsche bank already owns 29.95 percent of postbank and is looking to take control of the bank , which has the largest retail network in the country .
tuesday 's announcement applies to the roughly 30 percent of shares owned by various private and institutional investors , known as free float .
those investors have until october 5 to sell their shares .
biggest ever cash call deutsche bank will finance its bid via a capital increase worth 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4bn -rrb- .
on monday , the bank announced it would issue 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros a piece .
investors will be able to buy one new share for every two they already own in what is deutsche bank 's biggest ever cash call to investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post still owns 39.5 percent of postbank the remaining 39.5 percent stake in postbank belongs to deutsche post .
in september 2008 , deutsche post agreed to sell that stake to deutsche bank for 45 euros per share by 2013 .
at the time , postbank 's value was higher and deutsche bank will have to honor that price .
deutsche bank is keen to boost its customer base in germany .
taking over postbank means the combined bank will have 24 million retail clients , more than any other bank in germany .
at present , deutsche bank 's focus is on investment banking .
equity boost the takeover will also help boost deutsche 's capital base .
new global banking rules , known as the basel iii accord , require banks to hold more capital .
the agreement stipulates that banks will have to hold common equity equivalent to at least seven percent of their assets by 2019 .
that is more than triple the two percent required at the moment and is meant to shield banks from another financial crisis by acting as a cushion for potential losses .

tuesday , september 21 mainz – cologne mainz are topping the table to everyone 's surprise and look like a very solid team with a variety of players who can score .
cologne are doing what they do best and eking enough points to stay just above the relegation zone .
the billy goats held bayern to a scoreless draw in the last round , and they should be able to do the same against mainz .
prediction : 0-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings and bremen will look to get a boot in against hanover hoffenheim – bayern munich hoffenheim are off to a fine start , while bayern have n't scored in their past three matches .
not having arjen robben is a big factor , of course , and ivica olic has yet to find last season 's form .
but no one 's panicking in munich yet , and we think bayern will find their range again on tuesday .
prediction : bayern 2-1 hanover – werder bremen after two wins and a draw , hanover reverted to their meek losing form last weekend , while bremen will be looking for redemption after losing to mainz at home .
both teams are suspect at the back so this could be a real goal-fest , which always favors bremen .
prediction : bremen 4-2 wednesday , september 22 leverkusen – frankfurt frankfurt have looked better than their 1-0-3 record while leverkusen will have to get used to life without stefan kiessling , whose ankle injury will sideline him for the foreseeable future .
put those two things together and what you come out with is a dull draw .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thins have been hunky-dory for the men in yellow dortmund – kaiserslautern dortmund 's main challenge in this match is to get their feet back on the ground after thrashing arch-rivals schalke away on sunday .
kaiserslautern are proving difficult to beat , but then again dortmund , with its huge crowds , is a very difficult place to play , especially for a newly promoted team .
prediction : dortmund 2-1 hamburg – wolfsburg intriguing , intriguing .
there 's was little to like about hamburg 's draw with st. pauli over the weekend – except for mladen petric 's stunning goal .
if petric gets into the line-up , the northern germans should be able to handle the wolves , who have yet to show they can beat a good team .
prediction : hamburg 2-1 moenchengladbach – st. pauli this is a crucial match for gladbach after the foals got hammered to the tune of 7-1 by previously winless stuttgart .
st. pauli should give their back four much more time to get sorted , and gladbach have proven they can score goals .
prediction : gladbach 2-0 freiburg – schalke speaking of teams facing must-win situations … schalke .
four games , zero points , and a team that 's yet to gel on the pitch is the sad summation of the royal blues campaign thus far .
meanwhile , freiburg are a surprising fourth in the table , albeit thanks to a couple of lucky results .
schalke have n't had enough time to get their house in order , but a point should be within reach .
prediction : 1-1 nuremberg – stuttgart nuremberg have drawn three of their first four , while stuttgart recovered from an awful start to put seven past gladbach last week .
the club will put up much sturdier resistance , but they may try too hard to get a first win in front of their home fans , which could open opportunities for the swabians .

after a less than stellar start , they 'll try to reverse their fortunes by picking the winners and losers correctly this week . match day five in the bundesliga is upon us , and the only ones doing worse than schalke are dw 's team of football freaks .
we pulled off a rare feat last time around and managed to get all the results wrong -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but winners never quit , and quitters never win .
so we 're back at it again for the midweek matches .
here 's goes nothing .
tuesday , september 21 mainz – cologne mainz are topping the table to everyone 's surprise and look like a very solid team with a variety of players who can score .
cologne are doing what they do best and eking enough points to stay just above the relegation zone .
the billy goats held bayern to a scoreless draw in the last round , and they should be able to do the same against mainz .
prediction : 0-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings and bremen will look to get a boot in against hanover hoffenheim – bayern munich hoffenheim are off to a fine start , while bayern have n't scored in their past three matches .
not having arjen robben is a big factor , of course , and ivica olic has yet to find last season 's form .
but no one 's panicking in munich yet , and we think bayern will find their range again on tuesday .
prediction : bayern 2-1 hanover – werder bremen after two wins and a draw , hanover reverted to their meek losing form last weekend , while bremen will be looking for redemption after losing to mainz at home .
both teams are suspect at the back so this could be a real goal-fest , which always favors bremen .
prediction : bremen 4-2 wednesday , september 22 leverkusen – frankfurt frankfurt have looked better than their 1-0-3 record while leverkusen will have to get used to life without stefan kiessling , whose ankle injury will sideline him for the foreseeable future .
put those two things together and what you come out with is a dull draw .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thins have been hunky-dory for the men in yellow dortmund – kaiserslautern dortmund 's main challenge in this match is to get their feet back on the ground after thrashing arch-rivals schalke away on sunday .
kaiserslautern are proving difficult to beat , but then again dortmund , with its huge crowds , is a very difficult place to play , especially for a newly promoted team .
prediction : dortmund 2-1 hamburg – wolfsburg intriguing , intriguing .
there 's was little to like about hamburg 's draw with st. pauli over the weekend – except for mladen petric 's stunning goal .
if petric gets into the line-up , the northern germans should be able to handle the wolves , who have yet to show they can beat a good team .
prediction : hamburg 2-1 moenchengladbach – st. pauli this is a crucial match for gladbach after the foals got hammered to the tune of 7-1 by previously winless stuttgart .
st. pauli should give their back four much more time to get sorted , and gladbach have proven they can score goals .
prediction : gladbach 2-0 freiburg – schalke speaking of teams facing must-win situations … schalke .
four games , zero points , and a team that 's yet to gel on the pitch is the sad summation of the royal blues campaign thus far .
meanwhile , freiburg are a surprising fourth in the table , albeit thanks to a couple of lucky results .
schalke have n't had enough time to get their house in order , but a point should be within reach .
prediction : 1-1 nuremberg – stuttgart nuremberg have drawn three of their first four , while stuttgart recovered from an awful start to put seven past gladbach last week .
the club will put up much sturdier resistance , but they may try too hard to get a first win in front of their home fans , which could open opportunities for the swabians .

energy needed for economic progress a reliable energy supply is a prerequisite for economic development . the populations of poor countries often depend for their electricity on diesel generators and batteries , which are costly and environmentally damaging .

here , close to the equator , the sun sets for most of the year at around 6 in the evening and only rises 12 hours later .
in south american capitals like lima and quito , the population switches the lights on as soon as twilight kicks in .
but that 's not an option in villages up in the andes , most of which are n't connected to electricity grids .
across the planet , 1.6 billion people lack access to electricity , most of them in remote regions , and therefore lead their lives according to the changing of the seasons , sunrise and sunset – a way people in europe and north america stopped living hundreds of years ago .
decentralizing energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-wind hybrid systems are gaining ground the only way to bring electricity to rural areas is to focus on the development of decentralized , renewable energies .
solar panels on the roofs of huts have become a common sight in many developing nations .
these days , micro wind turbines are also becoming increasingly common , capable of covering the energy needs of households and farmsteads as well as being user-friendly and carbon-neutral .
" mini wind turbines are an excellent opportunity for developing nations , " ulf gerder from the german wind energy association -lrb- bwe -rrb- said .
in mongolia , for example , they are often the only source of energy available to nomads .
they carry their super-small wind turbines on the back of their horses .
energy needed for economic progress a reliable energy supply is a prerequisite for economic development . the populations of poor countries often depend for their electricity on diesel generators and batteries , which are costly and environmentally damaging .
mini wind turbines , on the other hand , are an efficient solution in terms both of easing poverty and helping the environment .
an east african ngo called green africa certainly thinks so , and is aiming to make them more common , installing mini wind turbines in villages in countries such as kenya , burundi and rwanda .
" access to electricity has a positive effect on many areas of life , " green africa 's kefa rabah explained .
it allows people to recharge mobile phones , for example , without having to head into a nearby town , which might be many kilometers away .
and in africa , cell phones are often a vital means of communication .
rabah also stressed how much access to electricity improves educational opportunities .
" the children of a goat herd only come home after dark , for example , " he said . " if there is electricity in their home , they can then still spend a few hours reading and doing homework . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the west bank village of susya , locals use solar panels and wind turbines to illuminate their makeshift homes but in fact , mini wind turbines are gaining in popularity not only in developing countries and emerging economies .
in europe and north america , they are seen as an attractive source of sustainable energy , and moreover , as affordable thanks to state subsidies supporting renewable energy infrastructure .
let there be light however , a major drawback to mini wind turbines in germany is that while power generated by a photovoltaic system stored in the grid is worth between 24 and 42 cents per kilowatt-hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- , energy generated by wind power is worth just 9 cents .
" solar and wind power should n't compete , they should complement one another , " gerder from the bwe said . hybrid energy providers that combine solar and wind power are indeed already available .
the winds of change are already blowing in the region of cajamarca in the remote northern highlands of peru .
the ngo " soluciones practicas " has installed mini wind turbines that provide over 4,000 families with a daily supply of electricity amounting to an average 0.3 kilowatts per hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- .
moreover , the organization ensures that every village is home to at least one technician able to repair and maintain the technology . " soluciones practicas " has also set up a training center where young people from all over the world can learn about renewable energy and take their expertise home with them .
micro turbines do n't just provide clean energy , they also offer people in remote regions the chance to be connected to the world .
in peru , the technology has already brought light to some of the darkest corners of the country .

dw-world.de use of wind energy continues to soar around the world clean wind energy is increasing in popularity around the world .
some 82 countries already harness energy from the wind to power homes and towns .
but the technology is still in its infancy in developing nations .
-lrb- 01.06.2010 -rrb- turbines start spinning at germany 's first offshore wind park germany 's first off-shore wind farm has gone into operation tuesday with environment minister norbert roettgen officially starting the 12 turbines constructed in the north sea .
-lrb- 27.04.2010 -rrb- the answer to clean living may be blowing in the wind wind power currently meets eight percent of national energy needs .
much of that comes from huge turbines at wind farms , but experts are now predicting major growth in a diminutive version of the same thing .
-lrb- 13.04.2010 -rrb- feedback do you think mini wind turbines should be used more in the developed world ?

at this oktoberfest , its hard to tell this year is the 200th anniversary of oktoberfest , but you don ’ t need to go to munich to experience the famous bavarian beer festival .
instead , you could head to sydney , australia at the opposite side of the world . australians tend to enjoy drinking .
they especially like beer in large quantities .
so it 's no wonder they embrace that greatest celebration of beer : oktoberfest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guests seem to enjoy it - no matter what continent they 're on in australia 's largest city , sydney , a number of “ oktoberfest ” celebrations are held across town .
they take place at german breweries , german restaurants , a university campus and pretty much anywhere people are looking for an excuse to imbibe and be merry .
the first venue to kick off the festivities this year was the loewenbraeu keller , a bavarian brewery and restaurant in an area known as the rocks , which is one of the oldest parts of the city and not far from sydney 's famous opera house .
the oktoberfest here at the loewenbraeu began the same weekend as the real event in munich and the festivities also began in the traditional way , with a keg tapping and a subsequent " beer shower " for those standing nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a delicious meal , if you can finish it the room is a smaller version of the famous oktoberfest beer tents .
there are drapes in bavarian blue and white hanging around the room and long wooden tables at which the guests eat and drink their fill .
the waiters and waitresses – most of whom are german or german-speaking – serve the guests with a smile while wearing dirndls and lederhosen , the traditional bavarian dresses and leather pants .
there are traditional bavarian beers imported from germany on offer .
loewenbraeu is available , as well as spaten , hofbraeu and others .
few guests are able to conquer the mountain of food served up by the kitchen : schnitzel , pork knuckle , sausages , bread dumplings and sauerkraut .
the bavarians ' representative reinhard wurtz , the general manager of the loewenbraeu , has been living in australia for ten years .
although originally from lake constance , he says he feels bavarian after serving in the army there and identifying with the culture .
" i think i 'm the right representative for the bavarians , " reinhard says .
he 's certainly getting into the bavarian spirit during oktoberfest , dressed in lederhosen and singing along when the live " oompah " band strikes up a tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loewenbraeu recreates munich 's beer tents reinhard is proud of the authenticity of the loewenbraeu 's oktoberfest , claiming the brewery is the most authentic bavarian beer house outside of bavaria .
he 's even about to head back to munich for this year 's oktoberfest to make sure he stays in touch with how it 's done at home .
" you have to get ideas when you 're away for a long time , " he says .
beer matters to australians most of the guests at the loewenbraeu oktoberfest are local sydneysiders , keen to enjoy some bavarian culture .
one woman says she 's always wanted to go to the real oktoberfest , but has never had the chance .
this is the next best thing , she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelry starts with a traditional keg-tapping others have been to munich and are happy to relive the memories .
but at least one visitor , known in this article as paul – but who also gave his name as steve and peter when asked – is more honest about his reasons for attending .
" the reason we 're out tonight is mainly because beer is very important to australians , " says paul , or steve , or peter .
" it 's also about good looking girls , but mainly it 's about the boys and having a few beers . "

at this oktoberfest , its hard to tell this year is the 200th anniversary of oktoberfest , but you don ’ t need to go to munich to experience the famous bavarian beer festival .
instead , you could head to sydney , australia at the opposite side of the world . australians tend to enjoy drinking .
they especially like beer in large quantities .
so it 's no wonder they embrace that greatest celebration of beer : oktoberfest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guests seem to enjoy it - no matter what continent they 're on in australia 's largest city , sydney , a number of “ oktoberfest ” celebrations are held across town .
they take place at german breweries , german restaurants , a university campus and pretty much anywhere people are looking for an excuse to imbibe and be merry .
the first venue to kick off the festivities this year was the loewenbraeu keller , a bavarian brewery and restaurant in an area known as the rocks , which is one of the oldest parts of the city and not far from sydney 's famous opera house .
the oktoberfest here at the loewenbraeu began the same weekend as the real event in munich and the festivities also began in the traditional way , with a keg tapping and a subsequent " beer shower " for those standing nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a delicious meal , if you can finish it the room is a smaller version of the famous oktoberfest beer tents .
there are drapes in bavarian blue and white hanging around the room and long wooden tables at which the guests eat and drink their fill .
the waiters and waitresses – most of whom are german or german-speaking – serve the guests with a smile while wearing dirndls and lederhosen , the traditional bavarian dresses and leather pants .
there are traditional bavarian beers imported from germany on offer .
loewenbraeu is available , as well as spaten , hofbraeu and others .
few guests are able to conquer the mountain of food served up by the kitchen : schnitzel , pork knuckle , sausages , bread dumplings and sauerkraut .
the bavarians ' representative reinhard wurtz , the general manager of the loewenbraeu , has been living in australia for ten years .
although originally from lake constance , he says he feels bavarian after serving in the army there and identifying with the culture .
" i think i 'm the right representative for the bavarians , " reinhard says .
he 's certainly getting into the bavarian spirit during oktoberfest , dressed in lederhosen and singing along when the live " oompah " band strikes up a tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loewenbraeu recreates munich 's beer tents reinhard is proud of the authenticity of the loewenbraeu 's oktoberfest , claiming the brewery is the most authentic bavarian beer house outside of bavaria .
he 's even about to head back to munich for this year 's oktoberfest to make sure he stays in touch with how it 's done at home .
" you have to get ideas when you 're away for a long time , " he says .
beer matters to australians most of the guests at the loewenbraeu oktoberfest are local sydneysiders , keen to enjoy some bavarian culture .
one woman says she 's always wanted to go to the real oktoberfest , but has never had the chance .
this is the next best thing , she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelry starts with a traditional keg-tapping others have been to munich and are happy to relive the memories .
but at least one visitor , known in this article as paul – but who also gave his name as steve and peter when asked – is more honest about his reasons for attending .
" the reason we 're out tonight is mainly because beer is very important to australians , " says paul , or steve , or peter .
" it 's also about good looking girls , but mainly it 's about the boys and having a few beers . "

the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .
the proposed code may make a law on the issue redundant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german interior minister hosted the one-day summit in berlin however , de maiziere recognized that such technology can be beneficial , and said he does not want to give people the right to delete images that can be viewed by the public anyway .
he does , however , want service providers to make it clearer how their privacy rights may be infringed by using particular services .
de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "
however , the interior minister wants to lay down a law to draw a " red line , " " which can not be crossed under any circumstances . "
this will be designed to stop particularly extreme violations of privacy .
if the internet companies can not decide on a code by december , de maiziere said the government would immediately intervene in the matter .
the german consumer protection minister ilse aigner welcomed the move as " a good basis , which we can build upon , and which will allow us to take into account the interests of the users . "
she demanded a balance between new technological advances , which can benefit consumers , and the protection of the privacy of individuals .
the head of internet giant google in europe , philipp schindler , also greeted the suggestion with enthusiasm and agreed his company would work with others to draw up the code .

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .
the proposed code may make a law on the issue redundant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german interior minister hosted the one-day summit in berlin however , de maiziere recognized that such technology can be beneficial , and said he does not want to give people the right to delete images that can be viewed by the public anyway .
he does , however , want service providers to make it clearer how their privacy rights may be infringed by using particular services .
de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "
however , the interior minister wants to lay down a law to draw a " red line , " " which can not be crossed under any circumstances . "
this will be designed to stop particularly extreme violations of privacy .
if the internet companies can not decide on a code by december , de maiziere said the government would immediately intervene in the matter .
the german consumer protection minister ilse aigner welcomed the move as " a good basis , which we can build upon , and which will allow us to take into account the interests of the users . "
she demanded a balance between new technological advances , which can benefit consumers , and the protection of the privacy of individuals .
the head of internet giant google in europe , philipp schindler , also greeted the suggestion with enthusiasm and agreed his company would work with others to draw up the code .
" geo-data from the internet is becoming more important for citizens , authorities and companies , a trend which will grow further with the rise of mobile internet use , " schindler added .

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .
the proposed code may make a law on the issue redundant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german interior minister hosted the one-day summit in berlin however , de maiziere recognized that such technology can be beneficial , and said he does not want to give people the right to delete images that can be viewed by the public anyway .
he does , however , want service providers to make it clearer how their privacy rights may be infringed by using particular services .
de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "
however , the interior minister wants to lay down a law to draw a " red line , " " which can not be crossed under any circumstances . "
this will be designed to stop particularly extreme violations of privacy .
if the internet companies can not decide on a code by december , de maiziere said the government would immediately intervene in the matter .
the german consumer protection minister ilse aigner welcomed the move as " a good basis , which we can build upon , and which will allow us to take into account the interests of the users . "
she demanded a balance between new technological advances , which can benefit consumers , and the protection of the privacy of individuals .
the head of internet giant google in europe , philipp schindler , also greeted the suggestion with enthusiasm and agreed his company would work with others to draw up the code .
" geo-data from the internet is becoming more important for citizens , authorities and companies , a trend which will grow further with the rise of mobile internet use , " schindler added .

a lot of money has been spent on development of the eastern states and the process is not yet finished . things did not go entirely to plan when , on july 1 , 1990 monetary , economic and social union and the deutschmark were introduced in east germany .
citizens of east germany greeted the changes with celebration but for the former socialist republic 's economy the consequences were devastating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall may have fallen , but economic divisions remain bonds and savings up to the value of 6,000 east german marks could be exchanged one-to-one for the deutschmark , but now firms had to pay for salaries in the new west german currency .
overnight , eastern companies were plunged defenselessly into competition with the west german economy - and they could only emerge as losers .
demand for east german products dropped dramatically as citizens simply did not want to buy the familiar old products with their new deutschmarks .
whether it was a basic food , a luxury item , technical equipment or a vehicle - it had to be a product from the west .
no alternative to monetary union experts had anticipated that monetary union would ruin the east german economy .
however , the then west german finance minister theo waigel said there was no alternative in 1990 .
the popular east german call of that year became " if the deutschmark does n't come to us , we will go to the deutschmark ! " and there was already mass immigration to the west .
" in the finance ministry at the time we discussed all theoretical possibilities , step-by step plans and ways to make the situation better . " said waigel .
" but introducing these plans would not have helped .
it would have been like putting up another wall in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister in 1990 theo waigel said all possibilities were explored in the united germany , economic power remained unevenly distributed .
former west german businesses did indeed sell their products in the east , but these continued to be produced in the west .
industrial jobs in the eastern states emerged only slowly .
even today , the economic output in the former east german states is only 71 percent of the level in the west .
gross domestic product per capita generated by private industry - a standard measure of performance - stands at around 66 percent of that in the west . continued solidarity waigel said that the development of the east had been the greatest act of solidarity to have ever taken place in germany .
he added that this was continuing ; it remains the case that none of the eastern states can finance itself .
according to the current plan of the german government the so called solidarity pact - about sharing the costs of development - is supposed to run until 2019 .

citizens of east germany greeted the changes with celebration but for the former socialist republic 's economy the consequences were devastating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall may have fallen , but economic divisions remain bonds and savings up to the value of 6,000 east german marks could be exchanged one-to-one for the deutschmark , but now firms had to pay for salaries in the new west german currency .
overnight , eastern companies were plunged defenselessly into competition with the west german economy - and they could only emerge as losers .
demand for east german products dropped dramatically as citizens simply did not want to buy the familiar old products with their new deutschmarks .
whether it was a basic food , a luxury item , technical equipment or a vehicle - it had to be a product from the west .
no alternative to monetary union experts had anticipated that monetary union would ruin the east german economy .
however , the then west german finance minister theo waigel said there was no alternative in 1990 .
the popular east german call of that year became " if the deutschmark does n't come to us , we will go to the deutschmark ! " and there was already mass immigration to the west .
" in the finance ministry at the time we discussed all theoretical possibilities , step-by step plans and ways to make the situation better . " said waigel .
" but introducing these plans would not have helped .
it would have been like putting up another wall in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister in 1990 theo waigel said all possibilities were explored in the united germany , economic power remained unevenly distributed .
former west german businesses did indeed sell their products in the east , but these continued to be produced in the west .
industrial jobs in the eastern states emerged only slowly .
even today , the economic output in the former east german states is only 71 percent of the level in the west .
gross domestic product per capita generated by private industry - a standard measure of performance - stands at around 66 percent of that in the west . continued solidarity waigel said that the development of the east had been the greatest act of solidarity to have ever taken place in germany .
he added that this was continuing ; it remains the case that none of the eastern states can finance itself .
according to the current plan of the german government the so called solidarity pact - about sharing the costs of development - is supposed to run until 2019 .

officials said merkel and sarkozy had both been " surprised by the trivial and baseless media controversy , " adding that the two leaders spent a minute discussing the topic during conversations on the sidelines in new york , and another 20 minutes on franco-german cooperation .

both leaders are attending the un general assembly 's special session on the millennium development goals in new york .

the bid will be paid for by a 10.2 billion euro capital increase . investors in postbank will be able to sell their shares to deutsche bank at 25 euros a piece from wednesday .
germany 's financial regulator bafin on tuesday set the price based on a three month average .
deutsche bank already owns 29.95 percent of postbank and is looking to take control of the bank , which has the largest retail network in the country .
tuesday 's announcement applies to the roughly 30 percent of shares owned by various private and institutional investors , known as free float .
those investors have until october 5 to sell their shares .
biggest ever cash call deutsche bank will finance its bid via a capital increase worth 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4bn -rrb- .
on monday , the bank announced it would issue 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros a piece .

in september 2008 , deutsche post agreed to sell that stake to deutsche bank for 45 euros per share by 2013 .
at the time , postbank 's value was higher and deutsche bank will have to honor that price .
deutsche bank is keen to boost its customer base in germany .
taking over postbank means the combined bank will have 24 million retail clients , more than any other bank in germany .
at present , deutsche bank 's focus is on investment banking .
equity boost the takeover will also help boost deutsche 's capital base .
new global banking rules , known as the basel iii accord , require banks to hold more capital .
the agreement stipulates that banks will have to hold common equity equivalent to at least seven percent of their assets by 2019 .
that is more than triple the two percent required at the moment and is meant to shield banks from another financial crisis by acting as a cushion for potential losses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 21.09.2010 germany launches campaign for sexual abuse victims to speak out großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign tells victims that talking can heal mental wounds in response to the child abuse scandal in the catholic church , thousands of german victims are being targeted by a new campaign that aims to end their silent suffering .
the message is that talking helps . in response to cases of child abuse within the jesuit order in germany earlier this year , the government in march established the post of an independent commissioner and also set up a telephone hotline for victims to speak about their suffering and seek help .
since then , about 2,500 germans have made contact with her office , said commissioner christine bergmann , adding " some 60 percent of them have never previously talked about what happened to them " .
on average , the victims were now " in their 50s " , she said , with the abuse having taken place " mostly some 20 , or sometimes even 40 or 50 years ago . "
clerical culprits almost 50 percent of sex abuse cases reported took place in german institutions , primarily in the roman catholic church , as well as on a lesser scale in sports clubs and at schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at berlin 's canisius college , run by jesuits , first cases of abuse were reported in january 2010 some 34 percent of the callers claimed to have been abused within their own families or by acquaintances .
" while the perpetrators were more than 80 percent male , it was surprising to see that almost as many men as women were victims of sexual abuse " , said joerg fegert , director of the ulm university clinic , who heads the team analysing the calls .
clear message fegert said the figures his team compiled with the prior consent of the victims were " far from representative for the entire german population " .
nevertheless the message the victims wanted to send to the general public was " very clear " .
" they believe it 's important to have someone who finally listens to them and believes what they say , " he said .
" compensation is also an issue because it would mean that the victims ' suffering is officially acknowledged . "
a key demand for politics was to make sure that a statute of limitations on sexual abuse was completely abolished , fegert said , because victims ' suffering did n't end after a certain time limit .
raising public awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a telephone hotline has been set up for victims independent commissioner christine bergmann on tuesday also launched a public campaign aimed at ending " decades of ignorance about the issue of sexual abuse in germany " .
a special internet website , as well as newspaper and television advertisements , are intended to publicise the abuse telephone hotline , so that many more victims can " break out of their isolation " .
german filmmaker wim wenders produced a special tv spot entitled : " breaking the silence breaks the power of the perpetrator " .
" ignoring bad things has a long tradition in germany " , wenders said , " but this ignorance perpetuates the trauma and must be ended to prevent cases of sexual abuse from happening again . "
experts ' roundtable round-table talks organized by the german government are scheduled to be held in november to discuss legal issues concerning sexual abuse , as well as medical and financial aid for the victims .
a group of victims who were sexually abused by members of the catholic jesuit order said on monday they would seek compensation payments of more than 80,000 euros -lrb- $ 105,000 -rrb- for each of the 205 victims .
german catholic bishops , currently meeting for their autumn session in fulda , said this sum was hard to imagine , and that they would seek a broader agreement on compensation with the government in november .

merkel said that more conditions should be attached to aid to ensure effective results . chancellor angela merkel has called for the governments of developing nations to take more responsibility in fighting poverty .
the chancellor also said that developed nations should attach tighter conditions to the money they lend and argued in favor of linking the amount to results already achieved .
she said that countries should not rely indefinitely on handouts and had to take charge of their own development . she added social progress was " unthinkable " without good governance and human rights .

" the primary responsibility for development lies with the governments of the developing countries .

therefore , support for good governance is as important as aid itself . "
merkel made her comments at the un general assembly 's special session on the millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- in new york on tuesday , an event attended by some 140 heads of state or government .
they are reviewing the progress of the mdgs agreed 10 years ago to cut poverty , and improve gender quality , health and education .
aid should be used more effectively firm conditions to ensure that money was spent in an effective way should be applied , according to the chancellor .
" development aid can not continue indefinitely .
the task is to use limited resources as effectively as possible . "
" we have to put results-based development aid at center stage , " merkel said .
" it should just only be about money but also about what comes of that money . "
the chancellor added lasting progress on development would require the world to successfully address challenges in four fields - peace and security , poverty reduction , environmental protection and promotion of human rights and good governance .
germany is the third biggest contributor to the un budget and it is one of the largest development aid donors .

however , the aid organization oxfam expressed disappointment in merkel 's speech .
" we expected much more from the german contribution , " oxfam spokeswoman emma seery commented after the speech .
" germany did not say how it will keep its promises to help poorer countries . "
helping women help themselves many experts are concerned that a number of the mdgs on poverty are unlikely to be achieved by the 2015 deadline .
several speakers at the meeting said the goals would not be achieved unless more is done to improve the lives of poor women .
liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf , africa 's first female head of state , called for more investment in sectors that help women , including agriculture and small businesses .
" as we renew our resolve in the year 2010 , we must recognize the need for inclusive economic growth , " she said .
the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , announced that 1 billion euros -lrb- 1.3 billion dollars -rrb- would be given to help africa , the caribbean and pacific countries lagging behind their mdgs .
barroso urged other donors not to use the economic crisis as an excuse to shirk their responsibilities to the poor .
" the international community still has a long way to go before the millennium goals are reached , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 21.09.2010 festival pays homage to german cinema classic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film 's expressionist style is still influential today arguably the best example of german expressionist cinema , the silent masterpiece " the cabinet of dr. caligari " was released to cinemas 90 years ago .
a festival in berlin is keen to keep its memory alive . ninety years after its release in berlin , the film " the cabinet of dr. caligari " is still recognized as having kick-started expressionist cinema , launched horror as a viable film genre , and introduced new narrative concepts such as flashbacks and twist endings .
it was a major influence on directors such as fritz lang and alfred hitchcock , who adopted caligari 's inventive and atmospheric use of light and shadow . now , the film has inspired its first festival , called somnambule .
held in weissensee - the same berlin neighborhood where the film was originally shot - the somnambule festival featured 10 days of film screenings , dance performances and exhibitions , all dedicated to the memory of a german masterpiece . history of a ' milestone ' " it wouldn ’ t be an exaggeration to describe this film as a milestone , " said nils foerster , the program director at the brotfabrik arts and culture center , where the festival was held .
" its influence can still be seen in film and art to this day . " " the cabinet of dr. caligari " was written by hans janowitz and carl mayer , who met in berlin just after world war i. they were fans of the then rapidly developing wave of expressionist art , and thought film could be a new platform for the style .
the pair decided to develop a horror story - a genre well-suited to the macabre and disorienting direction they visualized for their film .
they approached legendary producer erich pommer , then head of the decla-biscop studio .
he bought their script idea on the spot and agreed to produce the film in an avant-garde , expressionist style .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festival aims to be an annual event after director fritz lang initially turned the project down , robert wiene was assigned to direct the film in 1919 - although lang still had an influence on the film .
it was he who suggested bookending the main story with scenes set in a normal garden , creating a stark contrast to the bizarre , off-kilter world in which the film 's main narrative takes place . a film full of ' firsts ' much has been written about caligari 's novel use of artistic design ; the dizzying dreamworld at the heart of the film was created by hermann warm and set decorators walter reihmann and walter roehrig .
their use of skewed , paper sets which played with perspective , and had shadows painted directly onto them , was absolutely novel . producer pommer was wary at first , but after seeing test scenes , he was won over and gave his team free reign to produce the film as they saw fit . bildunterschrift : atmospheric lighting , distorted set design and exaggerated make-up combine to create a bizarre dreamworld the story was also one of the first in cinema to be told in flashback .
it concerns the villainous dr. caligari , played by werner krauss .
krauss was one of germany ’ s most highly-respected actors at the time , but his career was later tainted after he appeared in the 1940 nazi propaganda film " jud suess . "
a young conrad veidt was cast as caesare , caligari 's murderous accomplice , a somnambulist - or sleepwalker - who stalks the streets at night murdering young women .
actress lil dagover played jane , the sleeping beauty kidnapped by caesare . as if the novel set design and flashback framing device were n't revolutionary enough , the film is also credited with being the first in cinema history to introduce a twist-ending .
at the film 's conclusion it transpires that the events related by narrator fancis to his friend alan are not true at all : francis , jane and caesare are all inmates of a lunatic asylum , with caligari the asylum 's chief medical officer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somnambule patterned its logo on expressionist art " the cabinet of dr. caligari " went into production at the lixie-atelier in weissensee , just a few blocks from where the brotfabrik stands today - making it an utterly appropriate place to hold the somnambule festival , according to the brotfabrik 's foerster . . " wiessensee was the heart of the german film industry in the 1920s , " foerster said .
" nobody knows this anymore . " the film premiered at the marmorhaus cinema in berlin on february 26 , 1920 .
it was an immediate hit with critics and at the box office at home and abroad - and its influence is still felt in art world . " in our film program , there were movies from 1924 to 2010 , all of which were directly or indirectly influenced by ' the cabinet of dr. caligari . " ' said foerster .
" it was a trend-setter in the formative years of cinema , and the rules of set design and film language which it created are still valid to this day .

it was an immediate hit with critics and at the box office at home and abroad - and its influence is still felt in art world . " in our film program , there were movies from 1924 to 2010 , all of which were directly or indirectly influenced by ' the cabinet of dr. caligari . " ' said foerster .
" it was a trend-setter in the formative years of cinema , and the rules of set design and film language which it created are still valid to this day .

could new right-wing parties emerge in both countries ? the latest shock to the system came for the republican party in the name of christine o 'donnell .
her stunning victory over the establishment-backed candidate in the republican primary in the state of delaware catapulted the tea party activist from obscurity into the limelight .
on the same day , in the new york republican primary , a tea party supporter also beat the candidate favored by the party hierarchy .
their upsets , but also the growing public profile of a movement which has been supported by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin and right-wing talk-show host glenn beck , signal a possible realignment within the conservative political spectrum of the united states .
the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .
unlike most other advanced democracies , germany and the us so far have only one mainstream conservative party .
could that change now with a new right-wing party emerging in both countries ? economic loss while germany and the us share a segment of the electorate that is unhappy with the current situation and the political elite , the chances for a new party to the right of the center to profit from this malaise are vastly different , argue experts .
" what you have in these advanced industrial democracies is a general fear or sense of economic loss and i think this is very justified , " andrei markovits , professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , told deutsche welle .
" the response i may not agree with , but there is clearly a sense of that for the first time maybe the next generation will not be as well off as its parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tea party movement has been supported by fox news talk show host glenn beck however , below the surface of discontent with the conservative mainstream , the constituents of the tea party have a distinct background and motivation that sets them apart from the disenchanted conservatives in germany , notes thomas poguntke , professor for comparative politics at heinrich heine university in duesseldorf .
" i think the religious component of the tea party is a lot stronger than the religious component of the intra-conservative dissent in germany .
i would argue that the german debate within the christian democratic party has a lot to do with that the profile of the christian parties in germany has become a lot more unclear than it was in the past , " he told deutsche welle .
libertarian roots what 's more , says stephen silvia , a comparative politics expert at american university in washington d.c. , " the tea party is a party that is fundamentally a libertarian party .
and when one looks at the german political landscape the party that is ideologically closest to the tea party is not the cdu , but the -lrb- free market-oriented liberal party - ed . -rrb-
fdp . "
while it appears at the moment that the tea party movement stands a much better chance than the disenfranchized german conservatives of having a concrete impact on politics and policies , the likelihood of the tea party becoming a unique political force in the us is next to none .
" in the anglo-american so-called first-past-the-post system it is very difficult to create a successful third party , " says markovits .
" in fact the american history is littered with the graveyard of so-called third parties . "
poguntke concurs that the us two-party system is so strongly entrenched in the way the political system works that the only viable option for dissenting voices is to work through the existing parties .
he adds : " what the tea party movement is about is changing the republican party , pulling it further to the right . "
" it seems to me that the republican party has a very serious issue on its hands , because it basically played with fire , " says markovits .
" they are really the sorceror 's apprentice in that they played with it and then this suddenly became big and endangered the party itself . "
hurdles for new right-wing party in germany due to germany 's electoral system of proportional representation , the structural hurdles for establishing a new party are lower as the rise of the greens and left party has indicated .
but none of the experts interviewed by deutsche welle predicts the emergence of a national party right of the cdu in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the cdu is devoid of conservative voices the switch from a successful movement to a successful party is very difficult , says markovits .
" it 's a totally different gig .
movements can talk , movements have phenomenal voice options , whether they have the same deed options in a very complex parliamentarian system is a completely different story .
if you want to be a player , that 's a very tall order . "
what 's more , says poguntke , " there also is a stronger taboo to mobilize on the right in germany as in most other european countries due to our nazi past . "
in addition , he adds , until now the conservative parties in germany have always been very clever to cover their right-wing flank .
" i think to a certain degree this debate in germany is based on the partially false assumption that there is a huge electorate which is structurally very conservative , " says poguntke . there certainly are conservatives who do n't feel at home in the cdu anymore , he contends . " but this portion of the population is not as big as it used to be . "
for all those reasons , the experts view the battle over the soul of the republican party as the more interesting intra-conservative rumblings .
" the only chance is for the republicans to walk this fine tight rope that they have to moderate and also try to keep these guys , " says markovits .
" whether they can do it , i actually doubt very much because at the moment i do n't see a major republican leader who could do it .

while it appears at the moment that the tea party movement stands a much better chance than the disenfranchized german conservatives of having a concrete impact on politics and policies , the likelihood of the tea party becoming a unique political force in the us is next to none .

could new right-wing parties emerge in both countries ? the latest shock to the system came for the republican party in the name of christine o 'donnell .
her stunning victory over the establishment-backed candidate in the republican primary in the state of delaware catapulted the tea party activist from obscurity into the limelight .
on the same day , in the new york republican primary , a tea party supporter also beat the candidate favored by the party hierarchy .
their upsets , but also the growing public profile of a movement which has been supported by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin and right-wing talk-show host glenn beck , signal a possible realignment within the conservative political spectrum of the united states .
the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .
unlike most other advanced democracies , germany and the us so far have only one mainstream conservative party .
could that change now with a new right-wing party emerging in both countries ? economic loss while germany and the us share a segment of the electorate that is unhappy with the current situation and the political elite , the chances for a new party to the right of the center to profit from this malaise are vastly different , argue experts .
" what you have in these advanced industrial democracies is a general fear or sense of economic loss and i think this is very justified , " andrei markovits , professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , told deutsche welle .
" the response i may not agree with , but there is clearly a sense of that for the first time maybe the next generation will not be as well off as its parents . "

at this oktoberfest , its hard to tell this year is the 200th anniversary of oktoberfest , but you don ’ t need to go to munich to experience the famous bavarian beer festival .
instead , you could head to sydney , australia at the opposite side of the world . australians tend to enjoy drinking .
they especially like beer in large quantities .
so it 's no wonder they embrace that greatest celebration of beer : oktoberfest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guests seem to enjoy it - no matter what continent they 're on in australia 's largest city , sydney , a number of “ oktoberfest ” celebrations are held across town .
they take place at german breweries , german restaurants , a university campus and pretty much anywhere people are looking for an excuse to imbibe and be merry .
the first venue to kick off the festivities this year was the loewenbraeu keller , a bavarian brewery and restaurant in an area known as the rocks , which is one of the oldest parts of the city and not far from sydney 's famous opera house .
the oktoberfest here at the loewenbraeu began the same weekend as the real event in munich and the festivities also began in the traditional way , with a keg tapping and a subsequent " beer shower " for those standing nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a delicious meal , if you can finish it the room is a smaller version of the famous oktoberfest beer tents .
there are drapes in bavarian blue and white hanging around the room and long wooden tables at which the guests eat and drink their fill .
the waiters and waitresses – most of whom are german or german-speaking – serve the guests with a smile while wearing dirndls and lederhosen , the traditional bavarian dresses and leather pants .
there are traditional bavarian beers imported from germany on offer .
loewenbraeu is available , as well as spaten , hofbraeu and others .
few guests are able to conquer the mountain of food served up by the kitchen : schnitzel , pork knuckle , sausages , bread dumplings and sauerkraut .
the bavarians ' representative reinhard wurtz , the general manager of the loewenbraeu , has been living in australia for ten years .
although originally from lake constance , he says he feels bavarian after serving in the army there and identifying with the culture .
" i think i 'm the right representative for the bavarians , " reinhard says .
he 's certainly getting into the bavarian spirit during oktoberfest , dressed in lederhosen and singing along when the live " oompah " band strikes up a tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loewenbraeu recreates munich 's beer tents reinhard is proud of the authenticity of the loewenbraeu 's oktoberfest , claiming the brewery is the most authentic bavarian beer house outside of bavaria .

the french interior minister says the country is facing a " real terrorist threat . " the security level in france has been heightened after receiving intelligence that there was a threat of a possible suicide attack .
the tip-off came from algerian intelligence services and the potential bomber was thought to be a woman targeting either the paris metro transport system or a public gathering place .
" the terrorism threat is real , we have increased our vigilance , " said interior minister brice hortefeux on monday , without giving any specific details .
the heightened alert follows last tuesday 's ban on the wearing of the islamic face veil in public and recent military action against suspected islamic militants in north africa .
niger kidnappings authorities have warned an attack was increasingly possible since july when french soldiers were involved in a raid on an al qaeda camp in mali .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security has been boosted in public after al qaeda threats the north african wing of al qaeda , or al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- have warned they will kill french citizens in revenge for fighters killed in the raid .
as a result of the french action , aqim assassinated a 78-year-old french engineer who they took hostage in niger .
in addition , five french nationals were kidnapped in niger last week , reportedly by aqim .
the head of france 's counter intelligence service , bernard squarcini , has appeared in several interviews recently evoking the heightened alert , telling le monde on sunday : " carrying out an attack on our territory is among their objectives . "
authorities have visibly boosted police and military units patrolling landmarks , including the eiffel tower , where 2,000 people were evacuated last week after a hoax bomb threat .

the dung 's book , however , has made it to germany ’ s bookshelves . it is the 1980s .
tran linh is a young , well-educated man who lives in a provincial town in vietnam .
he plans to move to hanoi with his fiancée .
however , not being a member of the ruling socialist party , he is unable to obtain a valid residence permit for the capital and encounters many obstacles .
he does not have enough money to bribe the civil servants . tran linh is not a real person .
he is the main character of a novel by the dung , a vietnamese-born author who lives and works in berlin .
in der traum von orly -lrb- the dream of orly -rrb- , the author describes the various difficulties young intellectuals from vietnam would have faced some 25 years ago . " young vietnamese intellectuals didn ’ t have much choice when it came to going abroad .
it was a question of fate whether they got permission to go to russia , the gdr or poland , " the dung told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german version of the dream of orly was published in march 2010 " my main protagonist has one goal , " he explained .
" he wants to live in hanoi but unfortunately his situation is not very promising .
that ’ s why he draws up a big plan .
first , he has to go abroad .
orly is an address he has in mind .
he needs to make a detour to pursue his dream . " thousands of vietnamese went to gdr in 1980s to his disappointment , tran linh finds out that there is barely any chance of emigrating to france legally .
he could , if he wanted , join the growing number of boat people who escape in small fishing vessels .
however , he only wants to study abroad and then return to hanoi and therefore he has to find a legal way of leaving the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dung 's protagonist does not want to leave vietnam illegally like the boat people one legal way of leaving the country is to go to the gdr , where during the 1980s thousands of vietnamese were employed in the textile industry , numbering some 60,000 when the berlin wall fell in 1989 . many of them were forced to go home after german reunification but thousands stayed and today the vietnamese community in germany is about 85,000 strong . active on berlin 's literary scene the dung came to germany in 1989 and now plays an active role in berlin ’ s literary circles .
he is also a member of the german section of the international writers ’ association , the pen club . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of vietnamese stayed in germany after the fall of the berlin wall " today , i write about the life of vietnamese people in germany , and i want to continue doing that .
sometimes i organize public readings with my friends here in berlin . " at the end of the dung 's book , after the fall of the berlin wall , the hero finally leaves vietnam for germany .
he knows that there have been changes in the country he ’ s heading to but he can not foresee what this means for his own destiny .

the french interior minister says the country is facing a " real terrorist threat . " the security level in france has been heightened after receiving intelligence that there was a threat of a possible suicide attack .
the tip-off came from algerian intelligence services and the potential bomber was thought to be a woman targeting either the paris metro transport system or a public gathering place .
" the terrorism threat is real , we have increased our vigilance , " said interior minister brice hortefeux on monday , without giving any specific details .
the heightened alert follows last tuesday 's ban on the wearing of the islamic face veil in public and recent military action against suspected islamic militants in north africa .
niger kidnappings authorities have warned an attack was increasingly possible since july when french soldiers were involved in a raid on an al qaeda camp in mali .

as a result of the french action , aqim assassinated a 78-year-old french engineer who they took hostage in niger .
in addition , five french nationals were kidnapped in niger last week , reportedly by aqim .
the head of france 's counter intelligence service , bernard squarcini , has appeared in several interviews recently evoking the heightened alert , telling le monde on sunday : " carrying out an attack on our territory is among their objectives . "
authorities have visibly boosted police and military units patrolling landmarks , including the eiffel tower , where 2,000 people were evacuated last week after a hoax bomb threat .

however , he said , rules must be strictly observed . european central bank president jean-claude trichet has hailed the efforts of estonia in edging closer to joining the eurozone .
trichet said on monday that the fact that the baltic state had qualified showed that the currency bloc still had room to expand , despite recent concerns over the integrity of the currency .
estonia is due to become the eurozone 's 17th member on january 1 .
trichet said this showed that " that the euro area is not a ' closed shop ' but is open to those countries and economies that are fully compliant with the entry criteria in a convincing and sustainable manner . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro will be circulate alongside the kroon for two weeks trichet used an address in the estonian capital tallinn to repeat calls to strengthen the eurozone 's foundations and avoid the possibility of a new sovereign debt crisis , similar to that in greece earlier this year .
" the success of the euro depends on all euro area countries seriously engaging with the responsibilities that go hand in hand with the considerable benefits that euro area membership offers , " trichet said .
prices in estonia are already being displayed in euros as well as estonian kroons and there will be a two week period of dual circulation before the kroon ceases to become legal tender .
although the eu has approved a rescue fund for european states in danger of a debt crisis - worth 440 billion euros -lrb- $ 575 billion -rrb- - there are fresh fears about high levels of borrowing in greece , ireland and portugal .

a lot of money has been spent on development of the eastern states and the process is not yet finished . things did not go entirely to plan when , on july 1 , 1990 monetary , economic and social union and the deutschmark were introduced in east germany .
citizens of east germany greeted the changes with celebration but for the former socialist republic 's economy the consequences were devastating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall may have fallen , but economic divisions remain bonds and savings up to the value of 6,000 east german marks could be exchanged one-to-one for the deutschmark , but now firms had to pay for salaries in the new west german currency .
overnight , eastern companies were plunged defenselessly into competition with the west german economy - and they could only emerge as losers .
demand for east german products dropped dramatically as citizens simply did not want to buy the familiar old products with their new deutschmarks .
whether it was a basic food , a luxury item , technical equipment or a vehicle - it had to be a product from the west .
no alternative to monetary union experts had anticipated that monetary union would ruin the east german economy .
however , the then west german finance minister theo waigel said there was no alternative in 1990 .
the popular east german call of that year became " if the deutschmark does n't come to us , we will go to the deutschmark ! " and there was already mass immigration to the west .
" in the finance ministry at the time we discussed all theoretical possibilities , step-by step plans and ways to make the situation better . " said waigel .

it would have been like putting up another wall in germany . "

former west german businesses did indeed sell their products in the east , but these continued to be produced in the west .
industrial jobs in the eastern states emerged only slowly .
even today , the economic output in the former east german states is only 71 percent of the level in the west .
gross domestic product per capita generated by private industry - a standard measure of performance - stands at around 66 percent of that in the west . continued solidarity waigel said that the development of the east had been the greatest act of solidarity to have ever taken place in germany .
he added that this was continuing ; it remains the case that none of the eastern states can finance itself .

a lot of money has been spent on development of the eastern states and the process is not yet finished . things did not go entirely to plan when , on july 1 , 1990 monetary , economic and social union and the deutschmark were introduced in east germany .
citizens of east germany greeted the changes with celebration but for the former socialist republic 's economy the consequences were devastating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall may have fallen , but economic divisions remain bonds and savings up to the value of 6,000 east german marks could be exchanged one-to-one for the deutschmark , but now firms had to pay for salaries in the new west german currency .
overnight , eastern companies were plunged defenselessly into competition with the west german economy - and they could only emerge as losers .
demand for east german products dropped dramatically as citizens simply did not want to buy the familiar old products with their new deutschmarks .
whether it was a basic food , a luxury item , technical equipment or a vehicle - it had to be a product from the west .
no alternative to monetary union experts had anticipated that monetary union would ruin the east german economy .
however , the then west german finance minister theo waigel said there was no alternative in 1990 .
the popular east german call of that year became " if the deutschmark does n't come to us , we will go to the deutschmark ! " and there was already mass immigration to the west .
" in the finance ministry at the time we discussed all theoretical possibilities , step-by step plans and ways to make the situation better . " said waigel .

former west german businesses did indeed sell their products in the east , but these continued to be produced in the west .
industrial jobs in the eastern states emerged only slowly .
even today , the economic output in the former east german states is only 71 percent of the level in the west .
gross domestic product per capita generated by private industry - a standard measure of performance - stands at around 66 percent of that in the west . continued solidarity waigel said that the development of the east had been the greatest act of solidarity to have ever taken place in germany .
he added that this was continuing ; it remains the case that none of the eastern states can finance itself .
according to the current plan of the german government the so called solidarity pact - about sharing the costs of development - is supposed to run until 2019 .

could new right-wing parties emerge in both countries ? the latest shock to the system came for the republican party in the name of christine o 'donnell .
her stunning victory over the establishment-backed candidate in the republican primary in the state of delaware catapulted the tea party activist from obscurity into the limelight .
on the same day , in the new york republican primary , a tea party supporter also beat the candidate favored by the party hierarchy .
their upsets , but also the growing public profile of a movement which has been supported by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin and right-wing talk-show host glenn beck , signal a possible realignment within the conservative political spectrum of the united states .
the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .
unlike most other advanced democracies , germany and the us so far have only one mainstream conservative party .
could that change now with a new right-wing party emerging in both countries ? economic loss while germany and the us share a segment of the electorate that is unhappy with the current situation and the political elite , the chances for a new party to the right of the center to profit from this malaise are vastly different , argue experts .
" what you have in these advanced industrial democracies is a general fear or sense of economic loss and i think this is very justified , " andrei markovits , professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , told deutsche welle .
" the response i may not agree with , but there is clearly a sense of that for the first time maybe the next generation will not be as well off as its parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tea party movement has been supported by fox news talk show host glenn beck however , below the surface of discontent with the conservative mainstream , the constituents of the tea party have a distinct background and motivation that sets them apart from the disenchanted conservatives in germany , notes thomas poguntke , professor for comparative politics at heinrich heine university in duesseldorf .
" i think the religious component of the tea party is a lot stronger than the religious component of the intra-conservative dissent in germany .
i would argue that the german debate within the christian democratic party has a lot to do with that the profile of the christian parties in germany has become a lot more unclear than it was in the past , " he told deutsche welle .
libertarian roots what 's more , says stephen silvia , a comparative politics expert at american university in washington d.c. , " the tea party is a party that is fundamentally a libertarian party .
and when one looks at the german political landscape the party that is ideologically closest to the tea party is not the cdu , but the -lrb- free market-oriented liberal party - ed . -rrb-
fdp . "
while it appears at the moment that the tea party movement stands a much better chance than the disenfranchized german conservatives of having a concrete impact on politics and policies , the likelihood of the tea party becoming a unique political force in the us is next to none .
" in the anglo-american so-called first-past-the-post system it is very difficult to create a successful third party , " says markovits .
" in fact the american history is littered with the graveyard of so-called third parties . "
poguntke concurs that the us two-party system is so strongly entrenched in the way the political system works that the only viable option for dissenting voices is to work through the existing parties .
he adds : " what the tea party movement is about is changing the republican party , pulling it further to the right . "
" it seems to me that the republican party has a very serious issue on its hands , because it basically played with fire , " says markovits .
" they are really the sorceror 's apprentice in that they played with it and then this suddenly became big and endangered the party itself . "
hurdles for new right-wing party in germany due to germany 's electoral system of proportional representation , the structural hurdles for establishing a new party are lower as the rise of the greens and left party has indicated .
but none of the experts interviewed by deutsche welle predicts the emergence of a national party right of the cdu in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the cdu is devoid of conservative voices the switch from a successful movement to a successful party is very difficult , says markovits .
" it 's a totally different gig .
movements can talk , movements have phenomenal voice options , whether they have the same deed options in a very complex parliamentarian system is a completely different story .
if you want to be a player , that 's a very tall order . "
what 's more , says poguntke , " there also is a stronger taboo to mobilize on the right in germany as in most other european countries due to our nazi past . "
in addition , he adds , until now the conservative parties in germany have always been very clever to cover their right-wing flank .
" i think to a certain degree this debate in germany is based on the partially false assumption that there is a huge electorate which is structurally very conservative , " says poguntke . there certainly are conservatives who do n't feel at home in the cdu anymore , he contends . " but this portion of the population is not as big as it used to be . "
for all those reasons , the experts view the battle over the soul of the republican party as the more interesting intra-conservative rumblings .
" the only chance is for the republicans to walk this fine tight rope that they have to moderate and also try to keep these guys , " says markovits .
" whether they can do it , i actually doubt very much because at the moment i do n't see a major republican leader who could do it .
ronald reagan could have . "

after a less than stellar start , they 'll try to reverse their fortunes by picking the winners and losers correctly this week . match day five in the bundesliga is upon us , and the only ones doing worse than schalke are dw 's team of football freaks .
we pulled off a rare feat last time around and managed to get all the results wrong -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but winners never quit , and quitters never win .
so we 're back at it again for the midweek matches .
here 's goes nothing .
tuesday , september 21 mainz – cologne mainz are topping the table to everyone 's surprise and look like a very solid team with a variety of players who can score .
cologne are doing what they do best and eking enough points to stay just above the relegation zone .
the billy goats held bayern to a scoreless draw in the last round , and they should be able to do the same against mainz .
prediction : 0-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings and bremen will look to get a boot in against hanover hoffenheim – bayern munich hoffenheim are off to a fine start , while bayern have n't scored in their past three matches .
not having arjen robben is a big factor , of course , and ivica olic has yet to find last season 's form .
but no one 's panicking in munich yet , and we think bayern will find their range again on tuesday .
prediction : bayern 2-1 hanover – werder bremen after two wins and a draw , hanover reverted to their meek losing form last weekend , while bremen will be looking for redemption after losing to mainz at home .
both teams are suspect at the back so this could be a real goal-fest , which always favors bremen .
prediction : bremen 4-2 wednesday , september 22 leverkusen – frankfurt frankfurt have looked better than their 1-0-3 record while leverkusen will have to get used to life without stefan kiessling , whose ankle injury will sideline him for the foreseeable future .
put those two things together and what you come out with is a dull draw .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thins have been hunky-dory for the men in yellow dortmund – kaiserslautern dortmund 's main challenge in this match is to get their feet back on the ground after thrashing arch-rivals schalke away on sunday .
kaiserslautern are proving difficult to beat , but then again dortmund , with its huge crowds , is a very difficult place to play , especially for a newly promoted team .
prediction : dortmund 2-1 hamburg – wolfsburg intriguing , intriguing .
there 's was little to like about hamburg 's draw with st. pauli over the weekend – except for mladen petric 's stunning goal .
if petric gets into the line-up , the northern germans should be able to handle the wolves , who have yet to show they can beat a good team .
prediction : hamburg 2-1 moenchengladbach – st. pauli this is a crucial match for gladbach after the foals got hammered to the tune of 7-1 by previously winless stuttgart .
st. pauli should give their back four much more time to get sorted , and gladbach have proven they can score goals .
prediction : gladbach 2-0 freiburg – schalke speaking of teams facing must-win situations … schalke .
four games , zero points , and a team that 's yet to gel on the pitch is the sad summation of the royal blues campaign thus far .
meanwhile , freiburg are a surprising fourth in the table , albeit thanks to a couple of lucky results .
schalke have n't had enough time to get their house in order , but a point should be within reach .
prediction : 1-1 nuremberg – stuttgart nuremberg have drawn three of their first four , while stuttgart recovered from an awful start to put seven past gladbach last week .
the club will put up much sturdier resistance , but they may try too hard to get a first win in front of their home fans , which could open opportunities for the swabians .

tuesday , september 21 mainz – cologne mainz are topping the table to everyone 's surprise and look like a very solid team with a variety of players who can score .
cologne are doing what they do best and eking enough points to stay just above the relegation zone .
the billy goats held bayern to a scoreless draw in the last round , and they should be able to do the same against mainz .

both teams are suspect at the back so this could be a real goal-fest , which always favors bremen .

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .

de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "
however , the interior minister wants to lay down a law to draw a " red line , " " which can not be crossed under any circumstances . "
this will be designed to stop particularly extreme violations of privacy .
if the internet companies can not decide on a code by december , de maiziere said the government would immediately intervene in the matter .
the german consumer protection minister ilse aigner welcomed the move as " a good basis , which we can build upon , and which will allow us to take into account the interests of the users . "
she demanded a balance between new technological advances , which can benefit consumers , and the protection of the privacy of individuals .
the head of internet giant google in europe , philipp schindler , also greeted the suggestion with enthusiasm and agreed his company would work with others to draw up the code .
" geo-data from the internet is becoming more important for citizens , authorities and companies , a trend which will grow further with the rise of mobile internet use , " schindler added .

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .
the proposed code may make a law on the issue redundant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german interior minister hosted the one-day summit in berlin however , de maiziere recognized that such technology can be beneficial , and said he does not want to give people the right to delete images that can be viewed by the public anyway .
he does , however , want service providers to make it clearer how their privacy rights may be infringed by using particular services .
de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "
however , the interior minister wants to lay down a law to draw a " red line , " " which can not be crossed under any circumstances . "
this will be designed to stop particularly extreme violations of privacy .
if the internet companies can not decide on a code by december , de maiziere said the government would immediately intervene in the matter .
the german consumer protection minister ilse aigner welcomed the move as " a good basis , which we can build upon , and which will allow us to take into account the interests of the users . "
she demanded a balance between new technological advances , which can benefit consumers , and the protection of the privacy of individuals .

officials say the two met for informal discussions while at united nations talks in new york . following a meeting on the sidelines of the un millennium summit in new york , the office of french president nicolas sarkozy said that he and german chancellor angela merkel had cleared up a misunderstanding over the issue of france 's roma deportations .
officials said merkel and sarkozy had both been " surprised by the trivial and baseless media controversy , " adding that the two leaders spent a minute discussing the topic during conversations on the sidelines in new york , and another 20 minutes on franco-german cooperation .
sarkozy had said last week that merkel told him she , like him , was planning to clear illegal roma settlements .
however the german government strongly denied she had made such a statement .
there are no reported camps of roma immigrants in germany .
the french president made the comment at an eu summit in brussels as he came under fire for france 's deportation of more than 8,300 romanians and bulgarians , most of them roma .
both leaders are attending the un general assembly 's special session on the millennium development goals in new york .

here , close to the equator , the sun sets for most of the year at around 6 in the evening and only rises 12 hours later .
in south american capitals like lima and quito , the population switches the lights on as soon as twilight kicks in .
but that 's not an option in villages up in the andes , most of which are n't connected to electricity grids .
across the planet , 1.6 billion people lack access to electricity , most of them in remote regions , and therefore lead their lives according to the changing of the seasons , sunrise and sunset – a way people in europe and north america stopped living hundreds of years ago .
decentralizing energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-wind hybrid systems are gaining ground the only way to bring electricity to rural areas is to focus on the development of decentralized , renewable energies .
solar panels on the roofs of huts have become a common sight in many developing nations .
these days , micro wind turbines are also becoming increasingly common , capable of covering the energy needs of households and farmsteads as well as being user-friendly and carbon-neutral .
" mini wind turbines are an excellent opportunity for developing nations , " ulf gerder from the german wind energy association -lrb- bwe -rrb- said .
in mongolia , for example , they are often the only source of energy available to nomads .
they carry their super-small wind turbines on the back of their horses .
energy needed for economic progress a reliable energy supply is a prerequisite for economic development . the populations of poor countries often depend for their electricity on diesel generators and batteries , which are costly and environmentally damaging .
mini wind turbines , on the other hand , are an efficient solution in terms both of easing poverty and helping the environment .
an east african ngo called green africa certainly thinks so , and is aiming to make them more common , installing mini wind turbines in villages in countries such as kenya , burundi and rwanda .
" access to electricity has a positive effect on many areas of life , " green africa 's kefa rabah explained .
it allows people to recharge mobile phones , for example , without having to head into a nearby town , which might be many kilometers away .
and in africa , cell phones are often a vital means of communication .
rabah also stressed how much access to electricity improves educational opportunities .
" the children of a goat herd only come home after dark , for example , " he said . " if there is electricity in their home , they can then still spend a few hours reading and doing homework . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the west bank village of susya , locals use solar panels and wind turbines to illuminate their makeshift homes but in fact , mini wind turbines are gaining in popularity not only in developing countries and emerging economies .
in europe and north america , they are seen as an attractive source of sustainable energy , and moreover , as affordable thanks to state subsidies supporting renewable energy infrastructure .
let there be light however , a major drawback to mini wind turbines in germany is that while power generated by a photovoltaic system stored in the grid is worth between 24 and 42 cents per kilowatt-hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- , energy generated by wind power is worth just 9 cents .
" solar and wind power should n't compete , they should complement one another , " gerder from the bwe said . hybrid energy providers that combine solar and wind power are indeed already available .
the winds of change are already blowing in the region of cajamarca in the remote northern highlands of peru .
the ngo " soluciones practicas " has installed mini wind turbines that provide over 4,000 families with a daily supply of electricity amounting to an average 0.3 kilowatts per hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- .
moreover , the organization ensures that every village is home to at least one technician able to repair and maintain the technology . " soluciones practicas " has also set up a training center where young people from all over the world can learn about renewable energy and take their expertise home with them .
micro turbines do n't just provide clean energy , they also offer people in remote regions the chance to be connected to the world .
in peru , the technology has already brought light to some of the darkest corners of the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de computer -pipe- 21.09.2010 multi-touch floor on the way , german researchers say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multi-touch floor could have a login screen like this one from iphone to multi-touch tables , the leap has now been made to a touch-sensitive floor .
the researchers are presenting their work at a user interface conference in new york next month . while touch screens have existed for decades , multi-touch screens are still a relatively new innovation .
that 's the kind of screen found in the iphone , ipad and other devices .
it allows the user to touch the screen at three or more points , and enables stretching , dragging and other kinds of digital manipulation .
while multi-touch screens are becoming more and more commonplace , german researchers are now working on integrating this same technology into floors .
users would interact with the multi-touch floor by using their feet . "
when i walk across the floor with my shoes , i get a glowing , infrared imprint of my footprints , " explained patrick baudisch , head of the human computer interaction group at the hasso plattner institute in potsdam , germany . " and from that we can reconstruct where people are , and what shoes people wear because the soles are recognizable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multitoe floor would be able to identify users based on their footprints the demonstration model of the " multitoe " floor is about the size of a coffee table and measures about one meter by a half meter , and is raised up off the ground .
the floor itself is made of a thick piece of glass , topped with a black sheet of acrylic .
a camera , built-in to the floor , points up towards the ceiling .
the research team uses a technique called frustrated total internal reflection , that had been developed for use in finger-print scanners , until jeff han from new york university adapted it for use in multi-touch displays .
baudisch and his team hope that a multi-touch floor could be useful as a new way to interact with large amounts of visual data - like maps - or to play video games .
logging into the floor one of the interesting things about the floor is that you can log into it , just like a computer , because it can recognize individuals based on the pattern of their shoes .
when thomas augsten , one of the students working on the project , steps up onto the multi-touch floor , floor asks him a question : who are you ?
augsten taps the word " new " for new user , the floor scans his shoes and he 's given a color .
a keypad then appears on the floor and augsten types in his name with the toe of his shoe , making him a registered user .
while it is possible to type standing on one foot , it would probably be too tiring to write more than a few words .
one of the first challenges the research team had to overcome was how not to interact with the multi-touch floor - it has to be able to differentiate between people just walking around , and understand when they want to interact .
a smart floor could show the way according to johannes schoening , from the german research centre for artificial intelligence in saarbruecken , a touch sensitive floor could open up a whole range of possibilities . "
the main advantage is you can sense what 's going on , on the floor , " he said " but now you have to think about so what can you do with that information .
so for example if you are in the supermarket , you can provide navigational instructions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a multitoe floor could be used for large scale visual applications , like maps other examples could include a smart-floor in a museum or an airport that shows you the way - or even a dance club where you can interact with the visuals on the floor .
previously , the sustainable dance club company in the netherlands created a floor that generates power when people walk , jump and dance on it .
it 's fitted with led lights that can change color , but these use as little energy as possible because generating power is the priority .
eric van duin , an engineer with sustainable dance club , said his company is excited about the potential of an interactive floor like the multitoe - just as long as it does n't use too much power . "
our touch experience is very limited , so maybe it would be very interesting to combine these technologies to enhance our dance floor " , he said .
not just entertainment because the multitoe floor has a pressure sensor , baudisch added that potentially it could also be used as a medical tool to analyse posture and assess back problems , or in an assisted living situation .
the floor could sense if people have fallen down and help to increase the safety of inhabitants - without the drawback of visual surveillance . "
we probably would n't like the idea of people installing cameras in our homes , " he said . " and so you could envision something like a touch-sensitive floor that could actually reconstruct bits of your day .
have you gotten up ?
have you gotten some exercise ?
have you dressed ?
we can reconstruct a lot of these things , but without a lot of the privacy implications that a whole camera system has . "
a future of touch-screen interactivity even so , researchers envision a future where multi-touch devices and interactive elements like walls and floors could become a part of our everyday lives - where visual data will migrate between different devices - from an iphone , to a table , or be spread out and manipulated on a multi-touch floor .
still thought , despite the current boom in multi-touch devices , schoening also cautioned that modern society should n't incorporate multi-touch technology into everything just because it 's sexy . he added that designers and application developers should also think about where multi-touch devices are actually needed . "
there are definitely some really crappy examples how we should not use multi-touch , " he said . " do we really need a multi-touch ipod nano when all the thing we can do is rotate the mainscreen ? "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 21.09.2010 the rise of the far-right in the east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis gained ground in the east after the fall of the wall along with many other prejudices , eastern germany has had to contend with a reputation for neo-nazism .
it 's not entirely unjustified , but right-wing extremism in the east has roots in economic hardship . right-wing violence was most dramatic in the first years of the newly unified germany - and more and more often , they occurred in the former east germany .
for three consecutive nights in august 1992 , several hundred neo-nazis - watched by up to 2,000 locals - attacked an apartment block for asylum seekers in the north-eastern town of rostock .
with the police unprepared and initially outnumbered , the violence continued unchecked until it culminated in an arson attack .
the rostock riots quickly achieved international notoriety .
pictures of drunken , violent east germans doing hitler salutes were printed around the world .
this was not the dawn of a new , hopeful country that had been celebrated less than two years before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1992 arson attack on an asylum shelter in rostock became infamous authority vacuum neo-nazi violence was not just a stain on the former east germany .
over 100 of the 370 rioters arrested in rostock had travelled from the former west , where there was a string of horrific attacks on turkish immigrants in the early nineties .
but rostock cemented the reputation of post-wall eastern germany as a new haven for neo-nazism , and that reputation stuck .
what characterized the rostock riots as specifically east german was the powerlessness of the authorities . for two or three years after the fall of the wall , state institutions in the former german democratic republic were weakened by the period of transition .
police officers suddenly found themselves associated with a discredited regime .
dierk borstel , a researcher into right-wing extremism at the university of bielefeld , described the precarious circumstances in the early 1990s as linked to a lack of functioning insitutions .
" the police force was destabilized and the church had little influence anyway , " borstel told deutsche welle .
" the eastern german trade unions and the pds , the successor party to the former ruling communist sed , had little authority , and the trade unions and industry associations coming in from the west were all very weak in the east . "
worst of many worlds these semi-anarchic conditions were fertile ground for far-right activists in the former east germany , and their cause was further helped by the disappointment and poverty that spread in the east after reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd has scored some electoral success in the last six years " the expectation of east germans after reunification was : ' we 're going to get the security of the east plus the freedoms of the west , " ' borstel says .
" the result was that they lost the securities and could n't afford the freedoms . "
even though the skinhead neo-nazi scene originated in western europe , it already existed in east germany before the fall of the iron curtain .
it was often linked to certain football teams , and occasionally broke out in extreme violence , such as the attack of 30 skinheads on a concert in a church in central east berlin in 1987 .
the far-right movement in the east capitalized on what many describe as the gdr 's denial of its own nazi history .
olaf sundermeyer , author of " in the npd , " a book about the development of germany 's populist far-right national democratic party , believes the gdr 's distanced attitude to hitler 's germany helped feed the neo-nazi movement .
" communist leaders in the gdr said , ' we are an anti-fascist state and we have no responsibility for history .
there are no nazis here . '
of course that was n't true .
there were former nazis in both east and west germany , but there was no denazification in east germany - the nazi history was not dealt with , " he said .
imbalance and injustice east german society was never particularly multicultural , and the government 's immigration policies showed a determination to keep the population monotone .
immigrant workers from other socialist countries like mozambique were sent home if they got pregnant , or as soon as their allotted time ran out .
the lack of a multicultural foundation is still reflected in eastern german society today .
" eastern germany has a lot fewer immigrants - and it has long been acknowledged that where there are no immigrants and no jews , there is more racism and anti-semitism , " borstel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has caused unrest in the former gdr neo-nazis were also able to win over some east germans with familiar ideas .
" national socialism often starts out with the idea of socialism , and then that is combined with frustration , unemployment , lack of opportunity , and populations moving away . "
this is the opinion of a former neo-nazi who wants to remain anonymous , working for exit deutschland , an organization that helps people leave the far-right scene .
there is a widespread feeling that the west left the east behind economically .
in the last 20 years , unemployment in the former east has been consistently twice as high as in the west , and the emigration of young eastern germans remains a problem .
statistical evidence shows that german far-right parties tend to prosper in times of economic depression , and the npd has aimed its electoral resources aggressively at the most neglected districts .

sympathy for the left this growing eastern german sympathy with the far-right chimed in with a study completed in 2003 , which found that 16 percent of germans had an extreme right-wing world-view - that is , they expressed chauvinistic , anti-semitic , social-darwinist or xenophobic opinions , and tended to trivialize the nazi regime .
in the east , this world-view was found in 23 percent of the population , compared to 14 percent in the west .
this showed a marked change from the early 1990s , when a similar study found far-right-wing opinion more prevalent in the west .
statisticians have linked this switch to a decline in economic expectation .
whereas easterners were more optimistic about their economic prospects in the early 1990s , by the late 1990s , westerners had become more positive about the economy .
behind this turnaround lay a real sense of betrayal .
in a study written in 2005 , political scientist richard stoess wrote , " that the eastern german people overtook their western compatriots in sympathy for right-wing extremism lay in the fact that their initial trust in the western system of democracy and market economy had turned into particularly bitter disappointment .

it 's not entirely unjustified , but right-wing extremism in the east has roots in economic hardship . right-wing violence was most dramatic in the first years of the newly unified germany - and more and more often , they occurred in the former east germany .
for three consecutive nights in august 1992 , several hundred neo-nazis - watched by up to 2,000 locals - attacked an apartment block for asylum seekers in the north-eastern town of rostock .
with the police unprepared and initially outnumbered , the violence continued unchecked until it culminated in an arson attack .
the rostock riots quickly achieved international notoriety .
pictures of drunken , violent east germans doing hitler salutes were printed around the world .
this was not the dawn of a new , hopeful country that had been celebrated less than two years before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1992 arson attack on an asylum shelter in rostock became infamous authority vacuum neo-nazi violence was not just a stain on the former east germany .
over 100 of the 370 rioters arrested in rostock had travelled from the former west , where there was a string of horrific attacks on turkish immigrants in the early nineties .
but rostock cemented the reputation of post-wall eastern germany as a new haven for neo-nazism , and that reputation stuck .
what characterized the rostock riots as specifically east german was the powerlessness of the authorities . for two or three years after the fall of the wall , state institutions in the former german democratic republic were weakened by the period of transition .
police officers suddenly found themselves associated with a discredited regime .
dierk borstel , a researcher into right-wing extremism at the university of bielefeld , described the precarious circumstances in the early 1990s as linked to a lack of functioning insitutions .
" the police force was destabilized and the church had little influence anyway , " borstel told deutsche welle .
" the eastern german trade unions and the pds , the successor party to the former ruling communist sed , had little authority , and the trade unions and industry associations coming in from the west were all very weak in the east . "
worst of many worlds these semi-anarchic conditions were fertile ground for far-right activists in the former east germany , and their cause was further helped by the disappointment and poverty that spread in the east after reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd has scored some electoral success in the last six years " the expectation of east germans after reunification was : ' we 're going to get the security of the east plus the freedoms of the west , " ' borstel says .
" the result was that they lost the securities and could n't afford the freedoms . "
even though the skinhead neo-nazi scene originated in western europe , it already existed in east germany before the fall of the iron curtain .
it was often linked to certain football teams , and occasionally broke out in extreme violence , such as the attack of 30 skinheads on a concert in a church in central east berlin in 1987 .
the far-right movement in the east capitalized on what many describe as the gdr 's denial of its own nazi history .
olaf sundermeyer , author of " in the npd , " a book about the development of germany 's populist far-right national democratic party , believes the gdr 's distanced attitude to hitler 's germany helped feed the neo-nazi movement .
" communist leaders in the gdr said , ' we are an anti-fascist state and we have no responsibility for history .
there are no nazis here . '
of course that was n't true .
there were former nazis in both east and west germany , but there was no denazification in east germany - the nazi history was not dealt with , " he said .
imbalance and injustice east german society was never particularly multicultural , and the government 's immigration policies showed a determination to keep the population monotone .
immigrant workers from other socialist countries like mozambique were sent home if they got pregnant , or as soon as their allotted time ran out .
the lack of a multicultural foundation is still reflected in eastern german society today .
" eastern germany has a lot fewer immigrants - and it has long been acknowledged that where there are no immigrants and no jews , there is more racism and anti-semitism , " borstel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has caused unrest in the former gdr neo-nazis were also able to win over some east germans with familiar ideas .
" national socialism often starts out with the idea of socialism , and then that is combined with frustration , unemployment , lack of opportunity , and populations moving away . "
this is the opinion of a former neo-nazi who wants to remain anonymous , working for exit deutschland , an organization that helps people leave the far-right scene .
there is a widespread feeling that the west left the east behind economically .
in the last 20 years , unemployment in the former east has been consistently twice as high as in the west , and the emigration of young eastern germans remains a problem .
statistical evidence shows that german far-right parties tend to prosper in times of economic depression , and the npd has aimed its electoral resources aggressively at the most neglected districts .

" communist leaders in the gdr said , ' we are an anti-fascist state and we have no responsibility for history .
there are no nazis here . '
of course that was n't true .
there were former nazis in both east and west germany , but there was no denazification in east germany - the nazi history was not dealt with , " he said .
imbalance and injustice east german society was never particularly multicultural , and the government 's immigration policies showed a determination to keep the population monotone .
immigrant workers from other socialist countries like mozambique were sent home if they got pregnant , or as soon as their allotted time ran out .
the lack of a multicultural foundation is still reflected in eastern german society today .
" eastern germany has a lot fewer immigrants - and it has long been acknowledged that where there are no immigrants and no jews , there is more racism and anti-semitism , " borstel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has caused unrest in the former gdr neo-nazis were also able to win over some east germans with familiar ideas .
" national socialism often starts out with the idea of socialism , and then that is combined with frustration , unemployment , lack of opportunity , and populations moving away . "
this is the opinion of a former neo-nazi who wants to remain anonymous , working for exit deutschland , an organization that helps people leave the far-right scene .
there is a widespread feeling that the west left the east behind economically .
in the last 20 years , unemployment in the former east has been consistently twice as high as in the west , and the emigration of young eastern germans remains a problem .
statistical evidence shows that german far-right parties tend to prosper in times of economic depression , and the npd has aimed its electoral resources aggressively at the most neglected districts .
the exit deutschland representative , who has counseled numerous former neo-nazis , said that the frustration that comes from being left behind after watching friends leave your home town is a factor common to many of those who turn to right-wing extremism .
" those who stay , for whatever reason - because they ca n't find a job anywhere else , for example - feel an enormous frustration .
that is fertile ground for far-right groups - and for extremist groups in general , " he said .
sympathy for the left this growing eastern german sympathy with the far-right chimed in with a study completed in 2003 , which found that 16 percent of germans had an extreme right-wing world-view - that is , they expressed chauvinistic , anti-semitic , social-darwinist or xenophobic opinions , and tended to trivialize the nazi regime .
in the east , this world-view was found in 23 percent of the population , compared to 14 percent in the west .
this showed a marked change from the early 1990s , when a similar study found far-right-wing opinion more prevalent in the west .
statisticians have linked this switch to a decline in economic expectation .
whereas easterners were more optimistic about their economic prospects in the early 1990s , by the late 1990s , westerners had become more positive about the economy .
behind this turnaround lay a real sense of betrayal .
in a study written in 2005 , political scientist richard stoess wrote , " that the eastern german people overtook their western compatriots in sympathy for right-wing extremism lay in the fact that their initial trust in the western system of democracy and market economy had turned into particularly bitter disappointment . "
neo-nazis for the new century as state authority began to re-assert itself in the east , the far-right developed more subtle ways to organize .
" the structures have become smaller , " said borstel .
" they no longer rely on large parties like the npd , but rather local cells , which are more difficult for the state to break up .
they have become anchored in local communities in a way i thought would never happen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far-right has reinvented itself for the new century this assimilation was mirrored in the far-right political parties , which have spent the past decade making themselves electable in the east .
although the npd have steadily lost ground in the former west , in the east they have gained a foothold in several state parliaments .
" the big bang was the state election of 2004 in saxony , where the npd first gained representation in an eastern german state parliament , " said sundermeyer .
" since then it has very gradually established itself as a ' normal ' party . "
the npd was re-elected to the saxony parliament in 2009 , with 5.6 percent of the vote .
the npd 's membership figures had risen from 4,000 in 1995 to 6,800 in 2009 .
the npd has achieved this success by aiming its messages at young people , especially via the internet , and appealing to sentiments shared by the far-left - anti-americanism , anti-israel , anti-globalization .
it has worked to pick up the youth protest vote , targeting sub-cultures with an anti-system stance . author : ben knight editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it was in reality an expensive vanity project dreamed up by a group of big shots .
it combined massaged or falsified accounts , official incompetence , dodgy business partners and criminal intrigue .
now the town is stuck with a huge unfinished building and a mountain of debt .

the bid will be paid for by a 10.2 billion euro capital increase . investors in postbank will be able to sell their shares to deutsche bank at 25 euros a piece from wednesday .
germany 's financial regulator bafin on tuesday set the price based on a three month average .
deutsche bank already owns 29.95 percent of postbank and is looking to take control of the bank , which has the largest retail network in the country .
tuesday 's announcement applies to the roughly 30 percent of shares owned by various private and institutional investors , known as free float .
those investors have until october 5 to sell their shares .
biggest ever cash call deutsche bank will finance its bid via a capital increase worth 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4bn -rrb- .
on monday , the bank announced it would issue 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros a piece .
investors will be able to buy one new share for every two they already own in what is deutsche bank 's biggest ever cash call to investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post still owns 39.5 percent of postbank the remaining 39.5 percent stake in postbank belongs to deutsche post .
in september 2008 , deutsche post agreed to sell that stake to deutsche bank for 45 euros per share by 2013 .
at the time , postbank 's value was higher and deutsche bank will have to honor that price .
deutsche bank is keen to boost its customer base in germany .
taking over postbank means the combined bank will have 24 million retail clients , more than any other bank in germany .
at present , deutsche bank 's focus is on investment banking .
equity boost the takeover will also help boost deutsche 's capital base .
new global banking rules , known as the basel iii accord , require banks to hold more capital .
the agreement stipulates that banks will have to hold common equity equivalent to at least seven percent of their assets by 2019 .
that is more than triple the two percent required at the moment and is meant to shield banks from another financial crisis by acting as a cushion for potential losses .

the message is that talking helps . in response to cases of child abuse within the jesuit order in germany earlier this year , the government in march established the post of an independent commissioner and also set up a telephone hotline for victims to speak about their suffering and seek help .
since then , about 2,500 germans have made contact with her office , said commissioner christine bergmann , adding " some 60 percent of them have never previously talked about what happened to them " .
on average , the victims were now " in their 50s " , she said , with the abuse having taken place " mostly some 20 , or sometimes even 40 or 50 years ago . "
clerical culprits almost 50 percent of sex abuse cases reported took place in german institutions , primarily in the roman catholic church , as well as on a lesser scale in sports clubs and at schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at berlin 's canisius college , run by jesuits , first cases of abuse were reported in january 2010 some 34 percent of the callers claimed to have been abused within their own families or by acquaintances .
" while the perpetrators were more than 80 percent male , it was surprising to see that almost as many men as women were victims of sexual abuse " , said joerg fegert , director of the ulm university clinic , who heads the team analysing the calls .
clear message fegert said the figures his team compiled with the prior consent of the victims were " far from representative for the entire german population " .
nevertheless the message the victims wanted to send to the general public was " very clear " .
" they believe it 's important to have someone who finally listens to them and believes what they say , " he said .
" compensation is also an issue because it would mean that the victims ' suffering is officially acknowledged . "
a key demand for politics was to make sure that a statute of limitations on sexual abuse was completely abolished , fegert said , because victims ' suffering did n't end after a certain time limit .
raising public awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a telephone hotline has been set up for victims independent commissioner christine bergmann on tuesday also launched a public campaign aimed at ending " decades of ignorance about the issue of sexual abuse in germany " .
a special internet website , as well as newspaper and television advertisements , are intended to publicise the abuse telephone hotline , so that many more victims can " break out of their isolation " .
german filmmaker wim wenders produced a special tv spot entitled : " breaking the silence breaks the power of the perpetrator " .
" ignoring bad things has a long tradition in germany " , wenders said , " but this ignorance perpetuates the trauma and must be ended to prevent cases of sexual abuse from happening again . "
experts ' roundtable round-table talks organized by the german government are scheduled to be held in november to discuss legal issues concerning sexual abuse , as well as medical and financial aid for the victims .
a group of victims who were sexually abused by members of the catholic jesuit order said on monday they would seek compensation payments of more than 80,000 euros -lrb- $ 105,000 -rrb- for each of the 205 victims .
german catholic bishops , currently meeting for their autumn session in fulda , said this sum was hard to imagine , and that they would seek a broader agreement on compensation with the government in november .

program guide programs made in germany video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home / dw-tv asia + : made in germany question of the week -pipe- 21.09.2010 would you drive an electric car ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day it may be the most common form of transport .
it is quiet , nimble and practical , and it is powered by environmentally friendly energy .
but it has not yet managed to live up to that promise . what needs to be done to encourage people to drive electric cars ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : joe l. country : usa i bought a new prius back in 2007 , and if there is anything better i will buy it .
as soon as they are perfected i will own an electric car . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : john k. country : canada in my opinion , electric cars will not be the mainstream of transportation , fuels from water or solid " fuels " will be the ultimate energy used . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : ramesh p. country : india electric cars are very good for keeping a green environment .
the main goal for the future would be now to make these cars affordable , so common people can buy them .
but the batteries should be efficient , they should have a long lifespan and a good capacity .
it shouldn ’ t be expensive to have them changed every two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : marcio s. country : brazil my opinion is : while high gas prices and environmental concerns have driven increasing interest in electric cars , that interest has been frustrating since there are no available , fully functioning electric cars on the market .
the reason ?
extraordinarily high battery costs of up to $ 30,000 per vehicle killed the business case for the electric cars test marketed by automakers in the 1990s .
while we 're waiting for better and cheaper batteries to come , there are some limited choices available , if you still want to buy an electric car .
understand that most electric cars are different than conventional vehicles , and consider whether these differences are important to you .
weigh the positive -lrb- zero localized emissions , pennies-per-mile costs , convenient at-home recharging -rrb- and the negative -lrb- high purchase price , limited functionality , unknown resale value -rrb- criteria . it would definitely give us more pleasure to drive electric cars , so let the people know it is easy , let them think about the future of mankind - oil or gas cars will only be a legends , but electric cars are already the future ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : brent d. country : usa instead of relying on batteries that have to be charged by " plugging " them in to an outlet , why not utilize the spinning of the wheels to act as turbines to charge the batteries whenever the car is driven ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : r. mohammad h. country : india given the opportunity , i would drive an electric car .
here in india we do have an electric car available on the market , called reva , but i have not been able to purchase one , because not only is it almost as expensive as a premium small car , but it has also only two seats and a range of only 80 km per charge .
now that the world has finally woken up to the need for electric cars , i can now look forward to one with more choice in terms of price , capacity and range , in the not too distant future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : thorsten d. country : germany no doubt , e-cars will become the normal everyday vehicle in the near future . the most important thing is that a reasonable solution is found for a new type of battery , because for me it seems essential that those should provide a much greater km-range than the actual ones do - let ´ s say at least 300 kilometers .
another point is the design of an e-car .
it seems that for most german car builders they 're only an option to replace the combustion engine with an e-engine .
that 's definitly not the way !
there must be an entirely new concept for e-cars and weight is only one thing to consider .
on the other hand especially german car byers have to change their attitude towards cars : there mustn ´ t be an abundance of power , just as much as is necessary . do we really need to reach 100km / h in , lets say : 6 seconds ?
we just have to learn to be sensitive to this subject . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9798 dw-tv europe live made in germany - das wirtschaftsmagazin we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs made in germany video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home / dw-tv asia + : made in germany question of the week -pipe- 21.09.2010 would you drive an electric car ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day it may be the most common form of transport .
it is quiet , nimble and practical , and it is powered by environmentally friendly energy .
but it has not yet managed to live up to that promise . what needs to be done to encourage people to drive electric cars ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : joe l. country : usa i bought a new prius back in 2007 , and if there is anything better i will buy it .
as soon as they are perfected i will own an electric car . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : john k. country : canada in my opinion , electric cars will not be the mainstream of transportation , fuels from water or solid " fuels " will be the ultimate energy used . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : ramesh p. country : india electric cars are very good for keeping a green environment .
the main goal for the future would be now to make these cars affordable , so common people can buy them .
but the batteries should be efficient , they should have a long lifespan and a good capacity .
it shouldn ’ t be expensive to have them changed every two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : marcio s. country : brazil my opinion is : while high gas prices and environmental concerns have driven increasing interest in electric cars , that interest has been frustrating since there are no available , fully functioning electric cars on the market .
the reason ?
extraordinarily high battery costs of up to $ 30,000 per vehicle killed the business case for the electric cars test marketed by automakers in the 1990s .
while we 're waiting for better and cheaper batteries to come , there are some limited choices available , if you still want to buy an electric car .
understand that most electric cars are different than conventional vehicles , and consider whether these differences are important to you .
weigh the positive -lrb- zero localized emissions , pennies-per-mile costs , convenient at-home recharging -rrb- and the negative -lrb- high purchase price , limited functionality , unknown resale value -rrb- criteria . it would definitely give us more pleasure to drive electric cars , so let the people know it is easy , let them think about the future of mankind - oil or gas cars will only be a legends , but electric cars are already the future ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : brent d. country : usa instead of relying on batteries that have to be charged by " plugging " them in to an outlet , why not utilize the spinning of the wheels to act as turbines to charge the batteries whenever the car is driven ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : r. mohammad h. country : india given the opportunity , i would drive an electric car .
here in india we do have an electric car available on the market , called reva , but i have not been able to purchase one , because not only is it almost as expensive as a premium small car , but it has also only two seats and a range of only 80 km per charge .
now that the world has finally woken up to the need for electric cars , i can now look forward to one with more choice in terms of price , capacity and range , in the not too distant future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : thorsten d. country : germany no doubt , e-cars will become the normal everyday vehicle in the near future . the most important thing is that a reasonable solution is found for a new type of battery , because for me it seems essential that those should provide a much greater km-range than the actual ones do - let ´ s say at least 300 kilometers .
another point is the design of an e-car .
it seems that for most german car builders they 're only an option to replace the combustion engine with an e-engine .
that 's definitly not the way !
there must be an entirely new concept for e-cars and weight is only one thing to consider .
on the other hand especially german car byers have to change their attitude towards cars : there mustn ´ t be an abundance of power , just as much as is necessary . do we really need to reach 100km / h in , lets say : 6 seconds ?

merkel said that more conditions should be attached to aid to ensure effective results . chancellor angela merkel has called for the governments of developing nations to take more responsibility in fighting poverty .
the chancellor also said that developed nations should attach tighter conditions to the money they lend and argued in favor of linking the amount to results already achieved .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit has brought together some 140 world leaders " there is one thing we have to accept , " said merkel .
" the primary responsibility for development lies with the governments of the developing countries .
it is in their hands whether aid can be effective .
therefore , support for good governance is as important as aid itself . "
merkel made her comments at the un general assembly 's special session on the millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- in new york on tuesday , an event attended by some 140 heads of state or government .
they are reviewing the progress of the mdgs agreed 10 years ago to cut poverty , and improve gender quality , health and education .

the task is to use limited resources as effectively as possible . "

after reunification the government moved back to berlin , but bonn did n't sink into provincial obscurity .
quite the contrary . the change in bonn is most apparent on the streets around the deutsche welle building between eight and nine o 'clock in the morning .
rush hour in the post tower next door : hordes of young men in their mid- to late 30s -lrb- black suit , white shirt -rrb- and young women -lrb- business suit , blouse -rrb- , all on their way to the office .
laptop cases under their arms , cell phones glued to their ears , they stride confidently along , heading to their desks in the headquarters of the logistics company deutsche post dhl .
they could easily be employees going to work in a metropolis like london or paris .
for some , bonn is just a stopover en route to singapore , new york or hong kong .
some only stay half a year or so .
others , like christopher wade , stay here longer .
born in the united states , he now heads the communications team at deutsche post .
he met his wife when he was in bonn for a year as an exchange student and moved here in 1999 .
" i stayed without planning to , " he says .
he likes his office , high up in the transparent glass tower ; on a clear day he can see as far as cologne .
his daughter is well looked after in the deutsche post nursery .
life is good in the little town on the rhine , even now that the politicians have left .
international working environment the post tower , a lofty 162 meters -lrb- 531 feet -rrb- high , is visible for miles around .
it has long since replaced the modest beethoven house as the town 's best-known landmark .
the tower is a symbol of the former capital 's new status as a linchpin of international business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven was born in bonn but spent little time here many development organizations have settled here , too - as has the united nations .
it is represented in bonn by a number of different departments , including the secretariat of the un framework convention on climate change .
this aspect of the town is one that christopher wade , and others like him , particularly enjoys .
his working environment is an international one : " there are germans , romanians , filipinos and colleagues from singapore working in my team , " he says .
his circle of friends includes people of many different nationalities , and a great many bi-national marriages .
" bonn is certainly not a big city , but it 's got a good atmosphere .
it 's very international and multilingual .
you have the international school here ; there are students from all over the world studying at the university , and wherever i go i meet parents who work in some kind of international context . "
no call for nostalgia the days of the so-called " civil servant shuttle , " which would ferry homesick employees from their ministries back to bonn , are long gone .
everybody has moved on .
some have settled in berlin , while others have found new jobs .
a 1.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- package to compensate the town for its diminished importance and the loss of its former glory has helped to move some federal institutions to the banks of the rhine ; and six of the 15 government ministries still have their main seat here .
most of the political action now takes place in the new capital - but that does n't mean bonn is completely out of the picture .
former embassies have been spruced up and have found new owners ; the parliamentary chamber is now a conference center , and one million tourists a year demonstrate that there 's still considerable interest in the old capital on the rhine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor nimptsch faced a disaster when he moved into bonn 's town hall almost 20 years after the decision was made to move the capital to berlin , no one in bonn seems nostalgic for the old days .
why would they be ?
bonn has had to give up a lot , but it has also gained a great deal .
unemployment is relatively low , numerous modern businesses have settled here , cultural life is blossoming .
even so , bonners are currently experiencing something they are not at all used to : they 're having to tighten their belts .
" in the old days , when this was the capital , money flowed as if on tap , " explains juergen nimptsch , the mayor of bonn .
" now we have to save millions of euros , and at the same time we have a problem with a building that 's still under construction , " he adds , referring to the project he from the days when everything was conceived on a grand scale , regardless of the cost .
a big problem for a small town the " world conference center " -lrb- wccb -rrb- was conceived as a way to make bonn more attractive as a conference location after it lost its status as capital city .
but it was in reality an expensive vanity project dreamed up by a group of big shots .
it combined massaged or falsified accounts , official incompetence , dodgy business partners and criminal intrigue .
now the town is stuck with a huge unfinished building and a mountain of debt .
even so , mayor nimptsch says he would n't want to go back to the old days : " i prefer to live in the here and now ! "
and christopher wade in the post tower agrees .
" i think bonn has pretty much all you need .
just one thing : the weather could be better .
more sunshine .
i miss that here . "

after reunification the government moved back to berlin , but bonn did n't sink into provincial obscurity .
quite the contrary . the change in bonn is most apparent on the streets around the deutsche welle building between eight and nine o 'clock in the morning .
rush hour in the post tower next door : hordes of young men in their mid- to late 30s -lrb- black suit , white shirt -rrb- and young women -lrb- business suit , blouse -rrb- , all on their way to the office .
laptop cases under their arms , cell phones glued to their ears , they stride confidently along , heading to their desks in the headquarters of the logistics company deutsche post dhl .
they could easily be employees going to work in a metropolis like london or paris .
for some , bonn is just a stopover en route to singapore , new york or hong kong .
some only stay half a year or so .
others , like christopher wade , stay here longer .
born in the united states , he now heads the communications team at deutsche post .
he met his wife when he was in bonn for a year as an exchange student and moved here in 1999 .
" i stayed without planning to , " he says .
he likes his office , high up in the transparent glass tower ; on a clear day he can see as far as cologne .
his daughter is well looked after in the deutsche post nursery .
life is good in the little town on the rhine , even now that the politicians have left .
international working environment the post tower , a lofty 162 meters -lrb- 531 feet -rrb- high , is visible for miles around .
it has long since replaced the modest beethoven house as the town 's best-known landmark .
the tower is a symbol of the former capital 's new status as a linchpin of international business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven was born in bonn but spent little time here many development organizations have settled here , too - as has the united nations .
it is represented in bonn by a number of different departments , including the secretariat of the un framework convention on climate change .
this aspect of the town is one that christopher wade , and others like him , particularly enjoys .
his working environment is an international one : " there are germans , romanians , filipinos and colleagues from singapore working in my team , " he says .
his circle of friends includes people of many different nationalities , and a great many bi-national marriages .
" bonn is certainly not a big city , but it 's got a good atmosphere .
it 's very international and multilingual .
you have the international school here ; there are students from all over the world studying at the university , and wherever i go i meet parents who work in some kind of international context . "
no call for nostalgia the days of the so-called " civil servant shuttle , " which would ferry homesick employees from their ministries back to bonn , are long gone .
everybody has moved on .
some have settled in berlin , while others have found new jobs .
a 1.4 billion euro -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- package to compensate the town for its diminished importance and the loss of its former glory has helped to move some federal institutions to the banks of the rhine ; and six of the 15 government ministries still have their main seat here .
most of the political action now takes place in the new capital - but that does n't mean bonn is completely out of the picture .
former embassies have been spruced up and have found new owners ; the parliamentary chamber is now a conference center , and one million tourists a year demonstrate that there 's still considerable interest in the old capital on the rhine .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor nimptsch faced a disaster when he moved into bonn 's town hall almost 20 years after the decision was made to move the capital to berlin , no one in bonn seems nostalgic for the old days .
why would they be ?
bonn has had to give up a lot , but it has also gained a great deal .
unemployment is relatively low , numerous modern businesses have settled here , cultural life is blossoming .
even so , bonners are currently experiencing something they are not at all used to : they 're having to tighten their belts .
" in the old days , when this was the capital , money flowed as if on tap , " explains juergen nimptsch , the mayor of bonn .
" now we have to save millions of euros , and at the same time we have a problem with a building that 's still under construction , " he adds , referring to the project he from the days when everything was conceived on a grand scale , regardless of the cost .
a big problem for a small town the " world conference center " -lrb- wccb -rrb- was conceived as a way to make bonn more attractive as a conference location after it lost its status as capital city .
but it was in reality an expensive vanity project dreamed up by a group of big shots .
it combined massaged or falsified accounts , official incompetence , dodgy business partners and criminal intrigue .
now the town is stuck with a huge unfinished building and a mountain of debt .
even so , mayor nimptsch says he would n't want to go back to the old days : " i prefer to live in the here and now ! "
and christopher wade in the post tower agrees .
" i think bonn has pretty much all you need .
just one thing : the weather could be better .
more sunshine .

municipalities blame rising costs for benefits . german municipalities are heading for a record deficit this year , as communities are buckling under rising costs for a range of benefits , according to the german association of cities .
the german statistics office released figures on tuesday that show towns and cities spent 7.8 billion euros more than they earned in the first half of this year , compared with a deficit of just 4.2 billion in the first half of 2009 .
structural deficit " the government pushes through all kinds of new regulation in terms of benefits , " monika kuban , deputy director at the german association of cities told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people need benefits to top up their pension " they are , of course , useful , but with new initiatives , like nurseries for children under the age of three for example , it 's almost impossible to judge the costs for the local authorities , " she said .
kuban points out that , in the last 20 years , costs for benefits for the elderly , housing or the disabled have doubled , with the total amount expected to shoot up to 42 billion euros this year .
since 1998 , for example , costs for creches have gone up by 4.5 billion euros to 14.5 billion euros .
people are also getting older and that demographical change is reflected in higher costs for benefits being handed out , for example to people who can not live on their pension alone .
" it 's not just the financial crisis that has hit us hard , it 's demographics and new legislation from berlin that are weighing on our finances .
it 's a structural deficit , not just a temporary phenomenon , " kuban said .
trade tax remains controversial since the global financial crisis , income from trade tax , which makes up 20 percent of municipal revenue , has not only declined because of the dire economic situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you 're self-employed , like a dentist , you do n't pay trade tax " of course , our situation has been affected by the global crisis , but 50 percent of the decline in trade tax is down to legal changes aimed at helping companies weather the storm , " kuban told deutsche welle .
the trade tax , which has to be paid by all businesses on top of income tax and corporation tax , is frowned upon in the business world , as it contributes to germany having the highest corporate tax rates in europe .
the current governing coalition of christian democrats and the business-friendly free democrats has called for it to be abolished , but local authorities say they can not do without it .
" the tax is one of our main sources of revenue .
there are few loopholes , which is why businesses do n't like it , " says kuban .
" we want to keep it and also extend it to the self-employed , who do n't pay it at the moment .
as it 's enshrined in the constitution , you 'd need a parliamentary two-thirds majority to change the law , and parties like the social democrats just wo n't stand for it , " she explains .
kuban is calling on the government to make sure that the federal budget takes on a bigger share of the costs for social benefits to relieve local authorities .

municipalities blame rising costs for benefits . german municipalities are heading for a record deficit this year , as communities are buckling under rising costs for a range of benefits , according to the german association of cities .
the german statistics office released figures on tuesday that show towns and cities spent 7.8 billion euros more than they earned in the first half of this year , compared with a deficit of just 4.2 billion in the first half of 2009 .
structural deficit " the government pushes through all kinds of new regulation in terms of benefits , " monika kuban , deputy director at the german association of cities told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people need benefits to top up their pension " they are , of course , useful , but with new initiatives , like nurseries for children under the age of three for example , it 's almost impossible to judge the costs for the local authorities , " she said .
kuban points out that , in the last 20 years , costs for benefits for the elderly , housing or the disabled have doubled , with the total amount expected to shoot up to 42 billion euros this year .
since 1998 , for example , costs for creches have gone up by 4.5 billion euros to 14.5 billion euros .
people are also getting older and that demographical change is reflected in higher costs for benefits being handed out , for example to people who can not live on their pension alone .
" it 's not just the financial crisis that has hit us hard , it 's demographics and new legislation from berlin that are weighing on our finances .
it 's a structural deficit , not just a temporary phenomenon , " kuban said .
trade tax remains controversial since the global financial crisis , income from trade tax , which makes up 20 percent of municipal revenue , has not only declined because of the dire economic situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you 're self-employed , like a dentist , you do n't pay trade tax " of course , our situation has been affected by the global crisis , but 50 percent of the decline in trade tax is down to legal changes aimed at helping companies weather the storm , " kuban told deutsche welle .
the trade tax , which has to be paid by all businesses on top of income tax and corporation tax , is frowned upon in the business world , as it contributes to germany having the highest corporate tax rates in europe .
the current governing coalition of christian democrats and the business-friendly free democrats has called for it to be abolished , but local authorities say they can not do without it .
" the tax is one of our main sources of revenue .
there are few loopholes , which is why businesses do n't like it , " says kuban .
" we want to keep it and also extend it to the self-employed , who do n't pay it at the moment .
as it 's enshrined in the constitution , you 'd need a parliamentary two-thirds majority to change the law , and parties like the social democrats just wo n't stand for it , " she explains .
kuban is calling on the government to make sure that the federal budget takes on a bigger share of the costs for social benefits to relieve local authorities .

merkel said that more conditions should be attached to aid to ensure effective results . chancellor angela merkel has called for the governments of developing nations to take more responsibility in fighting poverty .
the chancellor also said that developed nations should attach tighter conditions to the money they lend and argued in favor of linking the amount to results already achieved .
she said that countries should not rely indefinitely on handouts and had to take charge of their own development . she added social progress was " unthinkable " without good governance and human rights .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit has brought together some 140 world leaders " there is one thing we have to accept , " said merkel .
" the primary responsibility for development lies with the governments of the developing countries .
it is in their hands whether aid can be effective .
therefore , support for good governance is as important as aid itself . "
merkel made her comments at the un general assembly 's special session on the millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- in new york on tuesday , an event attended by some 140 heads of state or government .
they are reviewing the progress of the mdgs agreed 10 years ago to cut poverty , and improve gender quality , health and education .
aid should be used more effectively firm conditions to ensure that money was spent in an effective way should be applied , according to the chancellor .
" development aid can not continue indefinitely .
the task is to use limited resources as effectively as possible . "
" we have to put results-based development aid at center stage , " merkel said .
" it should just only be about money but also about what comes of that money . "
the chancellor added lasting progress on development would require the world to successfully address challenges in four fields - peace and security , poverty reduction , environmental protection and promotion of human rights and good governance .
germany is the third biggest contributor to the un budget and it is one of the largest development aid donors .
potential for german seat on the security council the chancellor is keen for germany to become a non-permanent member of the influential un security council .
she claimed on tuesday that she had received " a lot of support and encouragment " for germany 's bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is hoping germany will get a seat on the un security council a seat on the un 's peacekeeping council would allow germany to " present its views more strongly . "
the new non-permanent members will be elected by the general assemby in october .
however , the aid organization oxfam expressed disappointment in merkel 's speech .
" we expected much more from the german contribution , " oxfam spokeswoman emma seery commented after the speech .
" germany did not say how it will keep its promises to help poorer countries . "
helping women help themselves many experts are concerned that a number of the mdgs on poverty are unlikely to be achieved by the 2015 deadline .
several speakers at the meeting said the goals would not be achieved unless more is done to improve the lives of poor women .
liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf , africa 's first female head of state , called for more investment in sectors that help women , including agriculture and small businesses .
" as we renew our resolve in the year 2010 , we must recognize the need for inclusive economic growth , " she said .
the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , announced that 1 billion euros -lrb- 1.3 billion dollars -rrb- would be given to help africa , the caribbean and pacific countries lagging behind their mdgs .
barroso urged other donors not to use the economic crisis as an excuse to shirk their responsibilities to the poor .
" the international community still has a long way to go before the millennium goals are reached , " he said .

merkel said that more conditions should be attached to aid to ensure effective results . chancellor angela merkel has called for the governments of developing nations to take more responsibility in fighting poverty .
the chancellor also said that developed nations should attach tighter conditions to the money they lend and argued in favor of linking the amount to results already achieved .
she said that countries should not rely indefinitely on handouts and had to take charge of their own development . she added social progress was " unthinkable " without good governance and human rights .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit has brought together some 140 world leaders " there is one thing we have to accept , " said merkel .
" the primary responsibility for development lies with the governments of the developing countries .
it is in their hands whether aid can be effective .
therefore , support for good governance is as important as aid itself . "
merkel made her comments at the un general assembly 's special session on the millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- in new york on tuesday , an event attended by some 140 heads of state or government .
they are reviewing the progress of the mdgs agreed 10 years ago to cut poverty , and improve gender quality , health and education .
aid should be used more effectively firm conditions to ensure that money was spent in an effective way should be applied , according to the chancellor .
" development aid can not continue indefinitely .
the task is to use limited resources as effectively as possible . "
" we have to put results-based development aid at center stage , " merkel said .
" it should just only be about money but also about what comes of that money . "
the chancellor added lasting progress on development would require the world to successfully address challenges in four fields - peace and security , poverty reduction , environmental protection and promotion of human rights and good governance .
germany is the third biggest contributor to the un budget and it is one of the largest development aid donors .
potential for german seat on the security council the chancellor is keen for germany to become a non-permanent member of the influential un security council .
she claimed on tuesday that she had received " a lot of support and encouragment " for germany 's bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is hoping germany will get a seat on the un security council a seat on the un 's peacekeeping council would allow germany to " present its views more strongly . "
the new non-permanent members will be elected by the general assemby in october .
however , the aid organization oxfam expressed disappointment in merkel 's speech .
" we expected much more from the german contribution , " oxfam spokeswoman emma seery commented after the speech .
" germany did not say how it will keep its promises to help poorer countries . "
helping women help themselves many experts are concerned that a number of the mdgs on poverty are unlikely to be achieved by the 2015 deadline .
several speakers at the meeting said the goals would not be achieved unless more is done to improve the lives of poor women .
liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf , africa 's first female head of state , called for more investment in sectors that help women , including agriculture and small businesses .
" as we renew our resolve in the year 2010 , we must recognize the need for inclusive economic growth , " she said .
the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , announced that 1 billion euros -lrb- 1.3 billion dollars -rrb- would be given to help africa , the caribbean and pacific countries lagging behind their mdgs .
barroso urged other donors not to use the economic crisis as an excuse to shirk their responsibilities to the poor .
" the international community still has a long way to go before the millennium goals are reached , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 21.09.2010 soccer legend lothar matthaeus set to take over as bulgaria coach großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus spent 20 years in the german team germany 's most capped footballer ever , lothar matthaeus , has so far had a less glorious coaching career .
his next challenge will be to try to salvage bulgaria 's hopes of qualifying for euro 2012 . the captain of germany 's world cup winning 1990 side , lothar matthaeus , appears to have landed a new job as coach of the bulgarian national team .
the bulgarian football union -lrb- bfu -rrb- announced on tuesday that matthaeus ' arrival was effectively a done deal .
" matthaeus will be officially presented in a few days , " bfu president borislav mihaylov told a news conference , saying that the playing legend had signed a one-year deal with an option for two more years at the helm .
matthaeus is to replace stanimir stoilov , who resigned earlier this month after bulgaria kicked off their euro 2012 qualifying campaign with back-to-back defeats – 0-4 away against england , and then 0-1 at the hands of montenegro on home soil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his predecessor stoilov quit in despair after two key defeats " we asked the under 21 's coach mihail madanski and former bulgarian assistant coach tsanko tsvetanov to assist matthaeus for next month 's qualifier against wales , " mihaylov said , in reference to the euro 2012 qualifying fixture in cardiff on october 8 .
with no points from two matches and notable competition from world cup 2010 contenders like england and switzerland , coached by high-profile german tactician ottmar hitzfeld , matthaeus could have his work cut out for him in sofia .
matthaeus yet to shine off the pitch with seven bundesliga titles , a world cup , an italian serie a league crown , a european championship and a string of other domestic titles to his name - not to mention an unmatched 150 appearances for germany - matthaeus ' soccer playing credentials can not be questioned .
he even successfully made the transition from the center of midfield to the sweeper position later in his career , helping his older legs keep pace with the evolving game .
so far , though , matthaeus ' coaching career has n't come close to emulating his glory days on the pitch , and it 's surely unlikely that the bulgarian squad now at his disposal could win any international silverware in the near future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus may try to woo striker dimitar berbatov back from international retirement matthaeus ' touchline highlight was probably his 2-0 friendly win against germany as hungary 's coach in 2004 , and the only trophy of note on his coaching cv is the 2003 serbian league championship , which he secured for partisan belgrade .
he has also coached rapid vienna and red bull salzburg in austria , atletico paranaense in brazil , and maccabi netanya in israel .
matthaeus left his last post in israel in april 2009 , and had been linked with a number of coaching jobs which he ultimately did not secure , most notably with the cameroon national team .
bulgaria have not qualified for a major international tournament since euro 2004 in portugal , where they were eliminated in the group stages .
however , the side did reach the semifinals of the 1994 world cup in the us , thanks largely to the lethal left of hristo stoichkov .
bulgaria even knocked germany out of that competition in the quarterfinals , winning 2-1 .
matthaeus probably has bittersweet memories of that match in new york against the side he is now to coach - he scored his last world cup goal for germany there from the penalty spot , but it proved little more than a consolation .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his predecessor stoilov quit in despair after two key defeats " we asked the under 21 's coach mihail madanski and former bulgarian assistant coach tsanko tsvetanov to assist matthaeus for next month 's qualifier against wales , " mihaylov said , in reference to the euro 2012 qualifying fixture in cardiff on october 8 .
with no points from two matches and notable competition from world cup 2010 contenders like england and switzerland , coached by high-profile german tactician ottmar hitzfeld , matthaeus could have his work cut out for him in sofia .
matthaeus yet to shine off the pitch with seven bundesliga titles , a world cup , an italian serie a league crown , a european championship and a string of other domestic titles to his name - not to mention an unmatched 150 appearances for germany - matthaeus ' soccer playing credentials can not be questioned .
he even successfully made the transition from the center of midfield to the sweeper position later in his career , helping his older legs keep pace with the evolving game .
so far , though , matthaeus ' coaching career has n't come close to emulating his glory days on the pitch , and it 's surely unlikely that the bulgarian squad now at his disposal could win any international silverware in the near future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthaeus may try to woo striker dimitar berbatov back from international retirement matthaeus ' touchline highlight was probably his 2-0 friendly win against germany as hungary 's coach in 2004 , and the only trophy of note on his coaching cv is the 2003 serbian league championship , which he secured for partisan belgrade .
he has also coached rapid vienna and red bull salzburg in austria , atletico paranaense in brazil , and maccabi netanya in israel .
matthaeus left his last post in israel in april 2009 , and had been linked with a number of coaching jobs which he ultimately did not secure , most notably with the cameroon national team .
bulgaria have not qualified for a major international tournament since euro 2004 in portugal , where they were eliminated in the group stages .
however , the side did reach the semifinals of the 1994 world cup in the us , thanks largely to the lethal left of hristo stoichkov .
bulgaria even knocked germany out of that competition in the quarterfinals , winning 2-1 .
matthaeus probably has bittersweet memories of that match in new york against the side he is now to coach - he scored his last world cup goal for germany there from the penalty spot , but it proved little more than a consolation .

merkel said that more conditions should be attached to aid to ensure effective results . chancellor angela merkel has called for the governments of developing nations to take more responsibility in fighting poverty .
the chancellor also said that developed nations should attach tighter conditions to the money they lend and argued in favor of linking the amount to results already achieved .
she said that countries should not rely indefinitely on handouts and had to take charge of their own development . she added social progress was " unthinkable " without good governance and human rights .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit has brought together some 140 world leaders " there is one thing we have to accept , " said merkel .
" the primary responsibility for development lies with the governments of the developing countries .
it is in their hands whether aid can be effective .
therefore , support for good governance is as important as aid itself . "
merkel made her comments at the un general assembly 's special session on the millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- in new york on tuesday , an event attended by some 140 heads of state or government .
they are reviewing the progress of the mdgs agreed 10 years ago to cut poverty , and improve gender quality , health and education .
aid should be used more effectively firm conditions to ensure that money was spent in an effective way should be applied , according to the chancellor .
" development aid can not continue indefinitely .
the task is to use limited resources as effectively as possible . "
" we have to put results-based development aid at center stage , " merkel said .
" it should just only be about money but also about what comes of that money . "
the chancellor added lasting progress on development would require the world to successfully address challenges in four fields - peace and security , poverty reduction , environmental protection and promotion of human rights and good governance .
germany is the third biggest contributor to the un budget and it is one of the largest development aid donors .
potential for german seat on the security council the chancellor is keen for germany to become a non-permanent member of the influential un security council .
she claimed on tuesday that she had received " a lot of support and encouragment " for germany 's bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is hoping germany will get a seat on the un security council a seat on the un 's peacekeeping council would allow germany to " present its views more strongly . "
the new non-permanent members will be elected by the general assemby in october .
however , the aid organization oxfam expressed disappointment in merkel 's speech .
" we expected much more from the german contribution , " oxfam spokeswoman emma seery commented after the speech .
" germany did not say how it will keep its promises to help poorer countries . "
helping women help themselves many experts are concerned that a number of the mdgs on poverty are unlikely to be achieved by the 2015 deadline .
several speakers at the meeting said the goals would not be achieved unless more is done to improve the lives of poor women .
liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf , africa 's first female head of state , called for more investment in sectors that help women , including agriculture and small businesses .
" as we renew our resolve in the year 2010 , we must recognize the need for inclusive economic growth , " she said .
the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , announced that 1 billion euros -lrb- 1.3 billion dollars -rrb- would be given to help africa , the caribbean and pacific countries lagging behind their mdgs .
barroso urged other donors not to use the economic crisis as an excuse to shirk their responsibilities to the poor .
" the international community still has a long way to go before the millennium goals are reached , " he said .

merkel said that more conditions should be attached to aid to ensure effective results . chancellor angela merkel has called for the governments of developing nations to take more responsibility in fighting poverty .
the chancellor also said that developed nations should attach tighter conditions to the money they lend and argued in favor of linking the amount to results already achieved .
she said that countries should not rely indefinitely on handouts and had to take charge of their own development . she added social progress was " unthinkable " without good governance and human rights .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit has brought together some 140 world leaders " there is one thing we have to accept , " said merkel .
" the primary responsibility for development lies with the governments of the developing countries .
it is in their hands whether aid can be effective .
therefore , support for good governance is as important as aid itself . "
merkel made her comments at the un general assembly 's special session on the millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- in new york on tuesday , an event attended by some 140 heads of state or government .
they are reviewing the progress of the mdgs agreed 10 years ago to cut poverty , and improve gender quality , health and education .
aid should be used more effectively firm conditions to ensure that money was spent in an effective way should be applied , according to the chancellor .
" development aid can not continue indefinitely .
the task is to use limited resources as effectively as possible . "
" we have to put results-based development aid at center stage , " merkel said .
" it should just only be about money but also about what comes of that money . "
the chancellor added lasting progress on development would require the world to successfully address challenges in four fields - peace and security , poverty reduction , environmental protection and promotion of human rights and good governance .
germany is the third biggest contributor to the un budget and it is one of the largest development aid donors .
potential for german seat on the security council the chancellor is keen for germany to become a non-permanent member of the influential un security council .
she claimed on tuesday that she had received " a lot of support and encouragment " for germany 's bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is hoping germany will get a seat on the un security council a seat on the un 's peacekeeping council would allow germany to " present its views more strongly . "
the new non-permanent members will be elected by the general assemby in october .
however , the aid organization oxfam expressed disappointment in merkel 's speech .
" we expected much more from the german contribution , " oxfam spokeswoman emma seery commented after the speech .
" germany did not say how it will keep its promises to help poorer countries . "
helping women help themselves many experts are concerned that a number of the mdgs on poverty are unlikely to be achieved by the 2015 deadline .
several speakers at the meeting said the goals would not be achieved unless more is done to improve the lives of poor women .
liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf , africa 's first female head of state , called for more investment in sectors that help women , including agriculture and small businesses .
" as we renew our resolve in the year 2010 , we must recognize the need for inclusive economic growth , " she said .
the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , announced that 1 billion euros -lrb- 1.3 billion dollars -rrb- would be given to help africa , the caribbean and pacific countries lagging behind their mdgs .
barroso urged other donors not to use the economic crisis as an excuse to shirk their responsibilities to the poor .
" the international community still has a long way to go before the millennium goals are reached , " he said .

the message is that talking helps . in response to cases of child abuse within the jesuit order in germany earlier this year , the government in march established the post of an independent commissioner and also set up a telephone hotline for victims to speak about their suffering and seek help .
since then , about 2,500 germans have made contact with her office , said commissioner christine bergmann , adding " some 60 percent of them have never previously talked about what happened to them " .
on average , the victims were now " in their 50s " , she said , with the abuse having taken place " mostly some 20 , or sometimes even 40 or 50 years ago . "
clerical culprits almost 50 percent of sex abuse cases reported took place in german institutions , primarily in the roman catholic church , as well as on a lesser scale in sports clubs and at schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at berlin 's canisius college , run by jesuits , first cases of abuse were reported in january 2010 some 34 percent of the callers claimed to have been abused within their own families or by acquaintances .
" while the perpetrators were more than 80 percent male , it was surprising to see that almost as many men as women were victims of sexual abuse " , said joerg fegert , director of the ulm university clinic , who heads the team analysing the calls .
clear message fegert said the figures his team compiled with the prior consent of the victims were " far from representative for the entire german population " .
nevertheless the message the victims wanted to send to the general public was " very clear " .
" they believe it 's important to have someone who finally listens to them and believes what they say , " he said .
" compensation is also an issue because it would mean that the victims ' suffering is officially acknowledged . "
a key demand for politics was to make sure that a statute of limitations on sexual abuse was completely abolished , fegert said , because victims ' suffering did n't end after a certain time limit .
raising public awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a telephone hotline has been set up for victims independent commissioner christine bergmann on tuesday also launched a public campaign aimed at ending " decades of ignorance about the issue of sexual abuse in germany " .
a special internet website , as well as newspaper and television advertisements , are intended to publicise the abuse telephone hotline , so that many more victims can " break out of their isolation " .
german filmmaker wim wenders produced a special tv spot entitled : " breaking the silence breaks the power of the perpetrator " .
" ignoring bad things has a long tradition in germany " , wenders said , " but this ignorance perpetuates the trauma and must be ended to prevent cases of sexual abuse from happening again . "
experts ' roundtable round-table talks organized by the german government are scheduled to be held in november to discuss legal issues concerning sexual abuse , as well as medical and financial aid for the victims .
a group of victims who were sexually abused by members of the catholic jesuit order said on monday they would seek compensation payments of more than 80,000 euros -lrb- $ 105,000 -rrb- for each of the 205 victims .
german catholic bishops , currently meeting for their autumn session in fulda , said this sum was hard to imagine , and that they would seek a broader agreement on compensation with the government in november .

experts ' roundtable round-table talks organized by the german government are scheduled to be held in november to discuss legal issues concerning sexual abuse , as well as medical and financial aid for the victims .
a group of victims who were sexually abused by members of the catholic jesuit order said on monday they would seek compensation payments of more than 80,000 euros -lrb- $ 105,000 -rrb- for each of the 205 victims .
german catholic bishops , currently meeting for their autumn session in fulda , said this sum was hard to imagine , and that they would seek a broader agreement on compensation with the government in november .

the vatican says it is perplexed by these actions . the head of the vatican bank , ettore gotti tedeschi , has been placed under investigation for suspected money-laundering , judicial sources said on tuesday .
italian financial authorities have seized 23 million euros -lrb- $ 30 million -rrb- from an account in the bank , officially known as the institute for works of religion -lrb- ior -rrb- .
the vatican responded saying that it was " perplexed and astonished " by the case , which is being investigated by rome magistrates .
a report by the italian news agency ansa says the money was seized as a precaution .
tedeschi and another bank manager are said to be under suspicion of breaking legislation that obliges banks to disclose information about their operations .
more than a year ago , italian investigators were reported to have been scrutinizing bank transactions worth millions of euros to see if they transgressed money laundering rules .
vatican says it backs bank transparency the italian press has reported that investigators suspect that individuals have used the bank as a " screen " to hide crimes such as fraud or tax evasion .
the bank was last involved in a major scandal in 1982 , when it was linked to the fraudulent bankruptcy of banco ambrosiano - then italy 's largest private bank .
us archbishop paul marcinkus headed the bank at the time amid accusations that the institution was linked to organized crime and alleged terrorist activities .

afflicted bats wake frequently and try to remove the fungus . while doing so they lose vital fat stores and usually starve to death before spring . the fungus is one of the issues being discussed at this year 's conference of parties to the un 's agreement on the conservation of populations of european bats -lrb- eurobats -rrb- in prague . " some species are threatened with extinction in north america , " said professor paul racey from the bat specialist group at the international union for conservation of nature . " we are very concerned to prevent that fungal organism from reaching europe and causing the same sort of devastation among our bat populations here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bats are sensitive to environmental changes useful but vulnerable racey is among around one hundred delegates attending the eurobats .
his colleague tony hutson believes that bats provide a useful clue as to the overall health of the environment . " they have certain aspects of their biology that make them quite vulnerable to human pressures and changes in climate and landscape , " said hutson . " so we should be using them to monitor the health of the environment and associated changes . "
bats in europe also face problems caused by human activity . more efficient heating insulation in buildings , for example , often deprives bats of valuable room to roost .
andreas streit , executive secretary of eurobats , says he and his colleagues are trying to come up with compromise solutions that guarantee both human comfort and bat health . " there 's no conflict between bat conservation and building renovation and construction work , " said streit .
" so wherever problems occur , compromise can be found relatively easily .
it 's just important that everyone involved is aware of this . " a substantial reduction in the bat population would have serious consequences for humanity .
they are , say the experts , very much worth protecting . author : rob cameron editor : nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .
the proposed code may make a law on the issue redundant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german interior minister hosted the one-day summit in berlin however , de maiziere recognized that such technology can be beneficial , and said he does not want to give people the right to delete images that can be viewed by the public anyway .
he does , however , want service providers to make it clearer how their privacy rights may be infringed by using particular services .
de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "
however , the interior minister wants to lay down a law to draw a " red line , " " which can not be crossed under any circumstances . "
this will be designed to stop particularly extreme violations of privacy .
if the internet companies can not decide on a code by december , de maiziere said the government would immediately intervene in the matter .
the german consumer protection minister ilse aigner welcomed the move as " a good basis , which we can build upon , and which will allow us to take into account the interests of the users . "
she demanded a balance between new technological advances , which can benefit consumers , and the protection of the privacy of individuals .
the head of internet giant google in europe , philipp schindler , also greeted the suggestion with enthusiasm and agreed his company would work with others to draw up the code .
" geo-data from the internet is becoming more important for citizens , authorities and companies , a trend which will grow further with the rise of mobile internet use , " schindler added .

the message is that talking helps . in response to cases of child abuse within the jesuit order in germany earlier this year , the government in march established the post of an independent commissioner and also set up a telephone hotline for victims to speak about their suffering and seek help .
since then , about 2,500 germans have made contact with her office , said commissioner christine bergmann , adding " some 60 percent of them have never previously talked about what happened to them " .
on average , the victims were now " in their 50s " , she said , with the abuse having taken place " mostly some 20 , or sometimes even 40 or 50 years ago . "
clerical culprits almost 50 percent of sex abuse cases reported took place in german institutions , primarily in the roman catholic church , as well as on a lesser scale in sports clubs and at schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at berlin 's canisius college , run by jesuits , first cases of abuse were reported in january 2010 some 34 percent of the callers claimed to have been abused within their own families or by acquaintances .
" while the perpetrators were more than 80 percent male , it was surprising to see that almost as many men as women were victims of sexual abuse " , said joerg fegert , director of the ulm university clinic , who heads the team analysing the calls .
clear message fegert said the figures his team compiled with the prior consent of the victims were " far from representative for the entire german population " .
nevertheless the message the victims wanted to send to the general public was " very clear " .
" they believe it 's important to have someone who finally listens to them and believes what they say , " he said .
" compensation is also an issue because it would mean that the victims ' suffering is officially acknowledged . "
a key demand for politics was to make sure that a statute of limitations on sexual abuse was completely abolished , fegert said , because victims ' suffering did n't end after a certain time limit .
raising public awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a telephone hotline has been set up for victims independent commissioner christine bergmann on tuesday also launched a public campaign aimed at ending " decades of ignorance about the issue of sexual abuse in germany " .
a special internet website , as well as newspaper and television advertisements , are intended to publicise the abuse telephone hotline , so that many more victims can " break out of their isolation " .
german filmmaker wim wenders produced a special tv spot entitled : " breaking the silence breaks the power of the perpetrator " .
" ignoring bad things has a long tradition in germany " , wenders said , " but this ignorance perpetuates the trauma and must be ended to prevent cases of sexual abuse from happening again . "
experts ' roundtable round-table talks organized by the german government are scheduled to be held in november to discuss legal issues concerning sexual abuse , as well as medical and financial aid for the victims .
a group of victims who were sexually abused by members of the catholic jesuit order said on monday they would seek compensation payments of more than 80,000 euros -lrb- $ 105,000 -rrb- for each of the 205 victims .
german catholic bishops , currently meeting for their autumn session in fulda , said this sum was hard to imagine , and that they would seek a broader agreement on compensation with the government in november .

here , close to the equator , the sun sets for most of the year at around 6 in the evening and only rises 12 hours later .
in south american capitals like lima and quito , the population switches the lights on as soon as twilight kicks in .
but that 's not an option in villages up in the andes , most of which are n't connected to electricity grids .
across the planet , 1.6 billion people lack access to electricity , most of them in remote regions , and therefore lead their lives according to the changing of the seasons , sunrise and sunset – a way people in europe and north america stopped living hundreds of years ago .
decentralizing energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-wind hybrid systems are gaining ground the only way to bring electricity to rural areas is to focus on the development of decentralized , renewable energies .
solar panels on the roofs of huts have become a common sight in many developing nations .
these days , micro wind turbines are also becoming increasingly common , capable of covering the energy needs of households and farmsteads as well as being user-friendly and carbon-neutral .
" mini wind turbines are an excellent opportunity for developing nations , " ulf gerder from the german wind energy association -lrb- bwe -rrb- said .
in mongolia , for example , they are often the only source of energy available to nomads .
they carry their super-small wind turbines on the back of their horses .
energy needed for economic progress a reliable energy supply is a prerequisite for economic development . the populations of poor countries often depend for their electricity on diesel generators and batteries , which are costly and environmentally damaging .
mini wind turbines , on the other hand , are an efficient solution in terms both of easing poverty and helping the environment .
an east african ngo called green africa certainly thinks so , and is aiming to make them more common , installing mini wind turbines in villages in countries such as kenya , burundi and rwanda .
" access to electricity has a positive effect on many areas of life , " green africa 's kefa rabah explained .
it allows people to recharge mobile phones , for example , without having to head into a nearby town , which might be many kilometers away .
and in africa , cell phones are often a vital means of communication .
rabah also stressed how much access to electricity improves educational opportunities .
" the children of a goat herd only come home after dark , for example , " he said . " if there is electricity in their home , they can then still spend a few hours reading and doing homework . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the west bank village of susya , locals use solar panels and wind turbines to illuminate their makeshift homes but in fact , mini wind turbines are gaining in popularity not only in developing countries and emerging economies .
in europe and north america , they are seen as an attractive source of sustainable energy , and moreover , as affordable thanks to state subsidies supporting renewable energy infrastructure .
let there be light however , a major drawback to mini wind turbines in germany is that while power generated by a photovoltaic system stored in the grid is worth between 24 and 42 cents per kilowatt-hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- , energy generated by wind power is worth just 9 cents .
" solar and wind power should n't compete , they should complement one another , " gerder from the bwe said . hybrid energy providers that combine solar and wind power are indeed already available .
the winds of change are already blowing in the region of cajamarca in the remote northern highlands of peru .
the ngo " soluciones practicas " has installed mini wind turbines that provide over 4,000 families with a daily supply of electricity amounting to an average 0.3 kilowatts per hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- .
moreover , the organization ensures that every village is home to at least one technician able to repair and maintain the technology . " soluciones practicas " has also set up a training center where young people from all over the world can learn about renewable energy and take their expertise home with them .
micro turbines do n't just provide clean energy , they also offer people in remote regions the chance to be connected to the world .
in peru , the technology has already brought light to some of the darkest corners of the country .

dw-world.de use of wind energy continues to soar around the world clean wind energy is increasing in popularity around the world .

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .
the proposed code may make a law on the issue redundant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german interior minister hosted the one-day summit in berlin however , de maiziere recognized that such technology can be beneficial , and said he does not want to give people the right to delete images that can be viewed by the public anyway .
he does , however , want service providers to make it clearer how their privacy rights may be infringed by using particular services .
de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "
however , the interior minister wants to lay down a law to draw a " red line , " " which can not be crossed under any circumstances . "
this will be designed to stop particularly extreme violations of privacy .
if the internet companies can not decide on a code by december , de maiziere said the government would immediately intervene in the matter .
the german consumer protection minister ilse aigner welcomed the move as " a good basis , which we can build upon , and which will allow us to take into account the interests of the users . "
she demanded a balance between new technological advances , which can benefit consumers , and the protection of the privacy of individuals .
the head of internet giant google in europe , philipp schindler , also greeted the suggestion with enthusiasm and agreed his company would work with others to draw up the code .
" geo-data from the internet is becoming more important for citizens , authorities and companies , a trend which will grow further with the rise of mobile internet use , " schindler added .

the country 's new center-right government has vowed it will stand firm . police officers , firefighters , soldiers and nurses were among tens of thousands protesting in prague on tuesday over government plans to slash salaries .

a lot of money has been spent on development of the eastern states and the process is not yet finished . things did not go entirely to plan when , on july 1 , 1990 monetary , economic and social union and the deutschmark were introduced in east germany .
citizens of east germany greeted the changes with celebration but for the former socialist republic 's economy the consequences were devastating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall may have fallen , but economic divisions remain bonds and savings up to the value of 6,000 east german marks could be exchanged one-to-one for the deutschmark , but now firms had to pay for salaries in the new west german currency .
overnight , eastern companies were plunged defenselessly into competition with the west german economy - and they could only emerge as losers .
demand for east german products dropped dramatically as citizens simply did not want to buy the familiar old products with their new deutschmarks .
whether it was a basic food , a luxury item , technical equipment or a vehicle - it had to be a product from the west .
no alternative to monetary union experts had anticipated that monetary union would ruin the east german economy .
however , the then west german finance minister theo waigel said there was no alternative in 1990 .
the popular east german call of that year became " if the deutschmark does n't come to us , we will go to the deutschmark ! " and there was already mass immigration to the west .
" in the finance ministry at the time we discussed all theoretical possibilities , step-by step plans and ways to make the situation better . " said waigel .
" but introducing these plans would not have helped .
it would have been like putting up another wall in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister in 1990 theo waigel said all possibilities were explored in the united germany , economic power remained unevenly distributed .
former west german businesses did indeed sell their products in the east , but these continued to be produced in the west .
industrial jobs in the eastern states emerged only slowly .
even today , the economic output in the former east german states is only 71 percent of the level in the west .
gross domestic product per capita generated by private industry - a standard measure of performance - stands at around 66 percent of that in the west . continued solidarity waigel said that the development of the east had been the greatest act of solidarity to have ever taken place in germany .
he added that this was continuing ; it remains the case that none of the eastern states can finance itself .
according to the current plan of the german government the so called solidarity pact - about sharing the costs of development - is supposed to run until 2019 .

the french interior minister says the country is facing a " real terrorist threat . " the security level in france has been heightened after receiving intelligence that there was a threat of a possible suicide attack .
the tip-off came from algerian intelligence services and the potential bomber was thought to be a woman targeting either the paris metro transport system or a public gathering place .
" the terrorism threat is real , we have increased our vigilance , " said interior minister brice hortefeux on monday , without giving any specific details .
the heightened alert follows last tuesday 's ban on the wearing of the islamic face veil in public and recent military action against suspected islamic militants in north africa .
niger kidnappings authorities have warned an attack was increasingly possible since july when french soldiers were involved in a raid on an al qaeda camp in mali .

as a result of the french action , aqim assassinated a 78-year-old french engineer who they took hostage in niger .
in addition , five french nationals were kidnapped in niger last week , reportedly by aqim .
the head of france 's counter intelligence service , bernard squarcini , has appeared in several interviews recently evoking the heightened alert , telling le monde on sunday : " carrying out an attack on our territory is among their objectives . "
authorities have visibly boosted police and military units patrolling landmarks , including the eiffel tower , where 2,000 people were evacuated last week after a hoax bomb threat .

could new right-wing parties emerge in both countries ? the latest shock to the system came for the republican party in the name of christine o 'donnell .
her stunning victory over the establishment-backed candidate in the republican primary in the state of delaware catapulted the tea party activist from obscurity into the limelight .
on the same day , in the new york republican primary , a tea party supporter also beat the candidate favored by the party hierarchy .
their upsets , but also the growing public profile of a movement which has been supported by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin and right-wing talk-show host glenn beck , signal a possible realignment within the conservative political spectrum of the united states .
the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .
unlike most other advanced democracies , germany and the us so far have only one mainstream conservative party .
could that change now with a new right-wing party emerging in both countries ? economic loss while germany and the us share a segment of the electorate that is unhappy with the current situation and the political elite , the chances for a new party to the right of the center to profit from this malaise are vastly different , argue experts .
" what you have in these advanced industrial democracies is a general fear or sense of economic loss and i think this is very justified , " andrei markovits , professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , told deutsche welle .
" the response i may not agree with , but there is clearly a sense of that for the first time maybe the next generation will not be as well off as its parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tea party movement has been supported by fox news talk show host glenn beck however , below the surface of discontent with the conservative mainstream , the constituents of the tea party have a distinct background and motivation that sets them apart from the disenchanted conservatives in germany , notes thomas poguntke , professor for comparative politics at heinrich heine university in duesseldorf .
" i think the religious component of the tea party is a lot stronger than the religious component of the intra-conservative dissent in germany .
i would argue that the german debate within the christian democratic party has a lot to do with that the profile of the christian parties in germany has become a lot more unclear than it was in the past , " he told deutsche welle .
libertarian roots what 's more , says stephen silvia , a comparative politics expert at american university in washington d.c. , " the tea party is a party that is fundamentally a libertarian party .
and when one looks at the german political landscape the party that is ideologically closest to the tea party is not the cdu , but the -lrb- free market-oriented liberal party - ed . -rrb-
fdp . "
while it appears at the moment that the tea party movement stands a much better chance than the disenfranchized german conservatives of having a concrete impact on politics and policies , the likelihood of the tea party becoming a unique political force in the us is next to none .
" in the anglo-american so-called first-past-the-post system it is very difficult to create a successful third party , " says markovits .
" in fact the american history is littered with the graveyard of so-called third parties . "
poguntke concurs that the us two-party system is so strongly entrenched in the way the political system works that the only viable option for dissenting voices is to work through the existing parties .
he adds : " what the tea party movement is about is changing the republican party , pulling it further to the right . "
" it seems to me that the republican party has a very serious issue on its hands , because it basically played with fire , " says markovits .
" they are really the sorceror 's apprentice in that they played with it and then this suddenly became big and endangered the party itself . "
hurdles for new right-wing party in germany due to germany 's electoral system of proportional representation , the structural hurdles for establishing a new party are lower as the rise of the greens and left party has indicated .
but none of the experts interviewed by deutsche welle predicts the emergence of a national party right of the cdu in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the cdu is devoid of conservative voices the switch from a successful movement to a successful party is very difficult , says markovits .
" it 's a totally different gig .
movements can talk , movements have phenomenal voice options , whether they have the same deed options in a very complex parliamentarian system is a completely different story .
if you want to be a player , that 's a very tall order . "
what 's more , says poguntke , " there also is a stronger taboo to mobilize on the right in germany as in most other european countries due to our nazi past . "
in addition , he adds , until now the conservative parties in germany have always been very clever to cover their right-wing flank .
" i think to a certain degree this debate in germany is based on the partially false assumption that there is a huge electorate which is structurally very conservative , " says poguntke . there certainly are conservatives who do n't feel at home in the cdu anymore , he contends . " but this portion of the population is not as big as it used to be . "
for all those reasons , the experts view the battle over the soul of the republican party as the more interesting intra-conservative rumblings .
" the only chance is for the republicans to walk this fine tight rope that they have to moderate and also try to keep these guys , " says markovits .
" whether they can do it , i actually doubt very much because at the moment i do n't see a major republican leader who could do it .

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .
the proposed code may make a law on the issue redundant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german interior minister hosted the one-day summit in berlin however , de maiziere recognized that such technology can be beneficial , and said he does not want to give people the right to delete images that can be viewed by the public anyway .
he does , however , want service providers to make it clearer how their privacy rights may be infringed by using particular services .
de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "
however , the interior minister wants to lay down a law to draw a " red line , " " which can not be crossed under any circumstances . "
this will be designed to stop particularly extreme violations of privacy .
if the internet companies can not decide on a code by december , de maiziere said the government would immediately intervene in the matter .
the german consumer protection minister ilse aigner welcomed the move as " a good basis , which we can build upon , and which will allow us to take into account the interests of the users . "
she demanded a balance between new technological advances , which can benefit consumers , and the protection of the privacy of individuals .
the head of internet giant google in europe , philipp schindler , also greeted the suggestion with enthusiasm and agreed his company would work with others to draw up the code .
" geo-data from the internet is becoming more important for citizens , authorities and companies , a trend which will grow further with the rise of mobile internet use , " schindler added .

at this oktoberfest , its hard to tell this year is the 200th anniversary of oktoberfest , but you don ’ t need to go to munich to experience the famous bavarian beer festival .
instead , you could head to sydney , australia at the opposite side of the world . australians tend to enjoy drinking .
they especially like beer in large quantities .
so it 's no wonder they embrace that greatest celebration of beer : oktoberfest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guests seem to enjoy it - no matter what continent they 're on in australia 's largest city , sydney , a number of “ oktoberfest ” celebrations are held across town .
they take place at german breweries , german restaurants , a university campus and pretty much anywhere people are looking for an excuse to imbibe and be merry .
the first venue to kick off the festivities this year was the loewenbraeu keller , a bavarian brewery and restaurant in an area known as the rocks , which is one of the oldest parts of the city and not far from sydney 's famous opera house .
the oktoberfest here at the loewenbraeu began the same weekend as the real event in munich and the festivities also began in the traditional way , with a keg tapping and a subsequent " beer shower " for those standing nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a delicious meal , if you can finish it the room is a smaller version of the famous oktoberfest beer tents .
there are drapes in bavarian blue and white hanging around the room and long wooden tables at which the guests eat and drink their fill .
the waiters and waitresses – most of whom are german or german-speaking – serve the guests with a smile while wearing dirndls and lederhosen , the traditional bavarian dresses and leather pants .
there are traditional bavarian beers imported from germany on offer .
loewenbraeu is available , as well as spaten , hofbraeu and others .
few guests are able to conquer the mountain of food served up by the kitchen : schnitzel , pork knuckle , sausages , bread dumplings and sauerkraut .
the bavarians ' representative reinhard wurtz , the general manager of the loewenbraeu , has been living in australia for ten years .
although originally from lake constance , he says he feels bavarian after serving in the army there and identifying with the culture .
" i think i 'm the right representative for the bavarians , " reinhard says .
he 's certainly getting into the bavarian spirit during oktoberfest , dressed in lederhosen and singing along when the live " oompah " band strikes up a tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loewenbraeu recreates munich 's beer tents reinhard is proud of the authenticity of the loewenbraeu 's oktoberfest , claiming the brewery is the most authentic bavarian beer house outside of bavaria .
he 's even about to head back to munich for this year 's oktoberfest to make sure he stays in touch with how it 's done at home .
" you have to get ideas when you 're away for a long time , " he says .
beer matters to australians most of the guests at the loewenbraeu oktoberfest are local sydneysiders , keen to enjoy some bavarian culture .
one woman says she 's always wanted to go to the real oktoberfest , but has never had the chance .
this is the next best thing , she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelry starts with a traditional keg-tapping others have been to munich and are happy to relive the memories .
but at least one visitor , known in this article as paul – but who also gave his name as steve and peter when asked – is more honest about his reasons for attending .
" the reason we 're out tonight is mainly because beer is very important to australians , " says paul , or steve , or peter .
" it 's also about good looking girls , but mainly it 's about the boys and having a few beers . "

the bid will be paid for by a 10.2 billion euro capital increase . investors in postbank will be able to sell their shares to deutsche bank at 25 euros a piece from wednesday .
germany 's financial regulator bafin on tuesday set the price based on a three month average .
deutsche bank already owns 29.95 percent of postbank and is looking to take control of the bank , which has the largest retail network in the country .
tuesday 's announcement applies to the roughly 30 percent of shares owned by various private and institutional investors , known as free float .
those investors have until october 5 to sell their shares .
biggest ever cash call deutsche bank will finance its bid via a capital increase worth 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4bn -rrb- .
on monday , the bank announced it would issue 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros a piece .
investors will be able to buy one new share for every two they already own in what is deutsche bank 's biggest ever cash call to investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post still owns 39.5 percent of postbank the remaining 39.5 percent stake in postbank belongs to deutsche post .
in september 2008 , deutsche post agreed to sell that stake to deutsche bank for 45 euros per share by 2013 .
at the time , postbank 's value was higher and deutsche bank will have to honor that price .
deutsche bank is keen to boost its customer base in germany .
taking over postbank means the combined bank will have 24 million retail clients , more than any other bank in germany .
at present , deutsche bank 's focus is on investment banking .
equity boost the takeover will also help boost deutsche 's capital base .
new global banking rules , known as the basel iii accord , require banks to hold more capital .
the agreement stipulates that banks will have to hold common equity equivalent to at least seven percent of their assets by 2019 .
that is more than triple the two percent required at the moment and is meant to shield banks from another financial crisis by acting as a cushion for potential losses .

deutsche bank is keen to boost its customer base in germany .

that is more than triple the two percent required at the moment and is meant to shield banks from another financial crisis by acting as a cushion for potential losses .

program guide programs made in germany video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home / dw-tv north america : made in germany question of the week -pipe- 21.09.2010 would you drive an electric car ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one day it may be the most common form of transport .
it is quiet , nimble and practical , and it is powered by environmentally friendly energy .
but it has not yet managed to live up to that promise . what needs to be done to encourage people to drive electric cars ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : joe l. country : usa i bought a new prius back in 2007 , and if there is anything better i will buy it .
as soon as they are perfected i will own an electric car . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : john k. country : canada in my opinion , electric cars will not be the mainstream of transportation , fuels from water or solid " fuels " will be the ultimate energy used . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : ramesh p. country : india electric cars are very good for keeping a green environment .
the main goal for the future would be now to make these cars affordable , so common people can buy them .
but the batteries should be efficient , they should have a long lifespan and a good capacity .
it shouldn ’ t be expensive to have them changed every two years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : marcio s. country : brazil my opinion is : while high gas prices and environmental concerns have driven increasing interest in electric cars , that interest has been frustrating since there are no available , fully functioning electric cars on the market .
the reason ?
extraordinarily high battery costs of up to $ 30,000 per vehicle killed the business case for the electric cars test marketed by automakers in the 1990s .
while we 're waiting for better and cheaper batteries to come , there are some limited choices available , if you still want to buy an electric car .
understand that most electric cars are different than conventional vehicles , and consider whether these differences are important to you .
weigh the positive -lrb- zero localized emissions , pennies-per-mile costs , convenient at-home recharging -rrb- and the negative -lrb- high purchase price , limited functionality , unknown resale value -rrb- criteria . it would definitely give us more pleasure to drive electric cars , so let the people know it is easy , let them think about the future of mankind - oil or gas cars will only be a legends , but electric cars are already the future ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : brent d. country : usa instead of relying on batteries that have to be charged by " plugging " them in to an outlet , why not utilize the spinning of the wheels to act as turbines to charge the batteries whenever the car is driven ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : r. mohammad h. country : india given the opportunity , i would drive an electric car .
here in india we do have an electric car available on the market , called reva , but i have not been able to purchase one , because not only is it almost as expensive as a premium small car , but it has also only two seats and a range of only 80 km per charge .
now that the world has finally woken up to the need for electric cars , i can now look forward to one with more choice in terms of price , capacity and range , in the not too distant future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : name : thorsten d. country : germany no doubt , e-cars will become the normal everyday vehicle in the near future . the most important thing is that a reasonable solution is found for a new type of battery , because for me it seems essential that those should provide a much greater km-range than the actual ones do - let ´ s say at least 300 kilometers .
another point is the design of an e-car .
it seems that for most german car builders they 're only an option to replace the combustion engine with an e-engine .
that 's definitly not the way !
there must be an entirely new concept for e-cars and weight is only one thing to consider .
on the other hand especially german car byers have to change their attitude towards cars : there mustn ´ t be an abundance of power , just as much as is necessary . do we really need to reach 100km / h in , lets say : 6 seconds ?

the french interior minister says the country is facing a " real terrorist threat . " the security level in france has been heightened after receiving intelligence that there was a threat of a possible suicide attack .
the tip-off came from algerian intelligence services and the potential bomber was thought to be a woman targeting either the paris metro transport system or a public gathering place .
" the terrorism threat is real , we have increased our vigilance , " said interior minister brice hortefeux on monday , without giving any specific details .
the heightened alert follows last tuesday 's ban on the wearing of the islamic face veil in public and recent military action against suspected islamic militants in north africa .
niger kidnappings authorities have warned an attack was increasingly possible since july when french soldiers were involved in a raid on an al qaeda camp in mali .

as a result of the french action , aqim assassinated a 78-year-old french engineer who they took hostage in niger .
in addition , five french nationals were kidnapped in niger last week , reportedly by aqim .
the head of france 's counter intelligence service , bernard squarcini , has appeared in several interviews recently evoking the heightened alert , telling le monde on sunday : " carrying out an attack on our territory is among their objectives . "
authorities have visibly boosted police and military units patrolling landmarks , including the eiffel tower , where 2,000 people were evacuated last week after a hoax bomb threat .

at this oktoberfest , its hard to tell this year is the 200th anniversary of oktoberfest , but you don ’ t need to go to munich to experience the famous bavarian beer festival .
instead , you could head to sydney , australia at the opposite side of the world . australians tend to enjoy drinking .
they especially like beer in large quantities .
so it 's no wonder they embrace that greatest celebration of beer : oktoberfest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guests seem to enjoy it - no matter what continent they 're on in australia 's largest city , sydney , a number of “ oktoberfest ” celebrations are held across town .
they take place at german breweries , german restaurants , a university campus and pretty much anywhere people are looking for an excuse to imbibe and be merry .
the first venue to kick off the festivities this year was the loewenbraeu keller , a bavarian brewery and restaurant in an area known as the rocks , which is one of the oldest parts of the city and not far from sydney 's famous opera house .
the oktoberfest here at the loewenbraeu began the same weekend as the real event in munich and the festivities also began in the traditional way , with a keg tapping and a subsequent " beer shower " for those standing nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a delicious meal , if you can finish it the room is a smaller version of the famous oktoberfest beer tents .
there are drapes in bavarian blue and white hanging around the room and long wooden tables at which the guests eat and drink their fill .
the waiters and waitresses – most of whom are german or german-speaking – serve the guests with a smile while wearing dirndls and lederhosen , the traditional bavarian dresses and leather pants .
there are traditional bavarian beers imported from germany on offer .
loewenbraeu is available , as well as spaten , hofbraeu and others .
few guests are able to conquer the mountain of food served up by the kitchen : schnitzel , pork knuckle , sausages , bread dumplings and sauerkraut .
the bavarians ' representative reinhard wurtz , the general manager of the loewenbraeu , has been living in australia for ten years .
although originally from lake constance , he says he feels bavarian after serving in the army there and identifying with the culture .
" i think i 'm the right representative for the bavarians , " reinhard says .
he 's certainly getting into the bavarian spirit during oktoberfest , dressed in lederhosen and singing along when the live " oompah " band strikes up a tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loewenbraeu recreates munich 's beer tents reinhard is proud of the authenticity of the loewenbraeu 's oktoberfest , claiming the brewery is the most authentic bavarian beer house outside of bavaria .
he 's even about to head back to munich for this year 's oktoberfest to make sure he stays in touch with how it 's done at home .
" you have to get ideas when you 're away for a long time , " he says .
beer matters to australians most of the guests at the loewenbraeu oktoberfest are local sydneysiders , keen to enjoy some bavarian culture .
one woman says she 's always wanted to go to the real oktoberfest , but has never had the chance .
this is the next best thing , she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelry starts with a traditional keg-tapping others have been to munich and are happy to relive the memories .
but at least one visitor , known in this article as paul – but who also gave his name as steve and peter when asked – is more honest about his reasons for attending .
" the reason we 're out tonight is mainly because beer is very important to australians , " says paul , or steve , or peter .
" it 's also about good looking girls , but mainly it 's about the boys and having a few beers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 21.09.2010 new right-wing parties face major obstacles in both germany and the us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little-known tea party candidate has rocked the republican establishment while the tea party is gaining strength in the us , some conservatives in germany question whether the ruling christian democrats are still conservative enough .
could new right-wing parties emerge in both countries ? the latest shock to the system came for the republican party in the name of christine o 'donnell .
her stunning victory over the establishment-backed candidate in the republican primary in the state of delaware catapulted the tea party activist from obscurity into the limelight .
on the same day , in the new york republican primary , a tea party supporter also beat the candidate favored by the party hierarchy .
their upsets , but also the growing public profile of a movement which has been supported by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin and right-wing talk-show host glenn beck , signal a possible realignment within the conservative political spectrum of the united states .
the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .
unlike most other advanced democracies , germany and the us so far have only one mainstream conservative party .
could that change now with a new right-wing party emerging in both countries ? economic loss while germany and the us share a segment of the electorate that is unhappy with the current situation and the political elite , the chances for a new party to the right of the center to profit from this malaise are vastly different , argue experts .
" what you have in these advanced industrial democracies is a general fear or sense of economic loss and i think this is very justified , " andrei markovits , professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , told deutsche welle .
" the response i may not agree with , but there is clearly a sense of that for the first time maybe the next generation will not be as well off as its parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tea party movement has been supported by fox news talk show host glenn beck however , below the surface of discontent with the conservative mainstream , the constituents of the tea party have a distinct background and motivation that sets them apart from the disenchanted conservatives in germany , notes thomas poguntke , professor for comparative politics at heinrich heine university in duesseldorf .
" i think the religious component of the tea party is a lot stronger than the religious component of the intra-conservative dissent in germany .
i would argue that the german debate within the christian democratic party has a lot to do with that the profile of the christian parties in germany has become a lot more unclear than it was in the past , " he told deutsche welle .
libertarian roots what 's more , says stephen silvia , a comparative politics expert at american university in washington d.c. , " the tea party is a party that is fundamentally a libertarian party .
and when one looks at the german political landscape the party that is ideologically closest to the tea party is not the cdu , but the -lrb- free market-oriented liberal party - ed . -rrb-
fdp . "
while it appears at the moment that the tea party movement stands a much better chance than the disenfranchized german conservatives of having a concrete impact on politics and policies , the likelihood of the tea party becoming a unique political force in the us is next to none .
" in the anglo-american so-called first-past-the-post system it is very difficult to create a successful third party , " says markovits .
" in fact the american history is littered with the graveyard of so-called third parties . "
poguntke concurs that the us two-party system is so strongly entrenched in the way the political system works that the only viable option for dissenting voices is to work through the existing parties .
he adds : " what the tea party movement is about is changing the republican party , pulling it further to the right . "
" it seems to me that the republican party has a very serious issue on its hands , because it basically played with fire , " says markovits .
" they are really the sorceror 's apprentice in that they played with it and then this suddenly became big and endangered the party itself . "
hurdles for new right-wing party in germany due to germany 's electoral system of proportional representation , the structural hurdles for establishing a new party are lower as the rise of the greens and left party has indicated .
but none of the experts interviewed by deutsche welle predicts the emergence of a national party right of the cdu in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the cdu is devoid of conservative voices the switch from a successful movement to a successful party is very difficult , says markovits .
" it 's a totally different gig .
movements can talk , movements have phenomenal voice options , whether they have the same deed options in a very complex parliamentarian system is a completely different story .
if you want to be a player , that 's a very tall order . "
what 's more , says poguntke , " there also is a stronger taboo to mobilize on the right in germany as in most other european countries due to our nazi past . "
in addition , he adds , until now the conservative parties in germany have always been very clever to cover their right-wing flank .
" i think to a certain degree this debate in germany is based on the partially false assumption that there is a huge electorate which is structurally very conservative , " says poguntke . there certainly are conservatives who do n't feel at home in the cdu anymore , he contends . " but this portion of the population is not as big as it used to be . "
for all those reasons , the experts view the battle over the soul of the republican party as the more interesting intra-conservative rumblings .
" the only chance is for the republicans to walk this fine tight rope that they have to moderate and also try to keep these guys , " says markovits .
" whether they can do it , i actually doubt very much because at the moment i do n't see a major republican leader who could do it .
ronald reagan could have . "

the french interior minister says the country is facing a " real terrorist threat . " the security level in france has been heightened after receiving intelligence that there was a threat of a possible suicide attack .
the tip-off came from algerian intelligence services and the potential bomber was thought to be a woman targeting either the paris metro transport system or a public gathering place .
" the terrorism threat is real , we have increased our vigilance , " said interior minister brice hortefeux on monday , without giving any specific details .
the heightened alert follows last tuesday 's ban on the wearing of the islamic face veil in public and recent military action against suspected islamic militants in north africa .
niger kidnappings authorities have warned an attack was increasingly possible since july when french soldiers were involved in a raid on an al qaeda camp in mali .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security has been boosted in public after al qaeda threats the north african wing of al qaeda , or al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- have warned they will kill french citizens in revenge for fighters killed in the raid .
as a result of the french action , aqim assassinated a 78-year-old french engineer who they took hostage in niger .
in addition , five french nationals were kidnapped in niger last week , reportedly by aqim .
the head of france 's counter intelligence service , bernard squarcini , has appeared in several interviews recently evoking the heightened alert , telling le monde on sunday : " carrying out an attack on our territory is among their objectives . "
authorities have visibly boosted police and military units patrolling landmarks , including the eiffel tower , where 2,000 people were evacuated last week after a hoax bomb threat .

after a less than stellar start , they 'll try to reverse their fortunes by picking the winners and losers correctly this week . match day five in the bundesliga is upon us , and the only ones doing worse than schalke are dw 's team of football freaks .
we pulled off a rare feat last time around and managed to get all the results wrong -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but winners never quit , and quitters never win .
so we 're back at it again for the midweek matches .
here 's goes nothing .
tuesday , september 21 mainz – cologne mainz are topping the table to everyone 's surprise and look like a very solid team with a variety of players who can score .
cologne are doing what they do best and eking enough points to stay just above the relegation zone .
the billy goats held bayern to a scoreless draw in the last round , and they should be able to do the same against mainz .
prediction : 0-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings and bremen will look to get a boot in against hanover hoffenheim – bayern munich hoffenheim are off to a fine start , while bayern have n't scored in their past three matches .
not having arjen robben is a big factor , of course , and ivica olic has yet to find last season 's form .
but no one 's panicking in munich yet , and we think bayern will find their range again on tuesday .
prediction : bayern 2-1 hanover – werder bremen after two wins and a draw , hanover reverted to their meek losing form last weekend , while bremen will be looking for redemption after losing to mainz at home .
both teams are suspect at the back so this could be a real goal-fest , which always favors bremen .
prediction : bremen 4-2 wednesday , september 22 leverkusen – frankfurt frankfurt have looked better than their 1-0-3 record while leverkusen will have to get used to life without stefan kiessling , whose ankle injury will sideline him for the foreseeable future .
put those two things together and what you come out with is a dull draw .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thins have been hunky-dory for the men in yellow dortmund – kaiserslautern dortmund 's main challenge in this match is to get their feet back on the ground after thrashing arch-rivals schalke away on sunday .
kaiserslautern are proving difficult to beat , but then again dortmund , with its huge crowds , is a very difficult place to play , especially for a newly promoted team .
prediction : dortmund 2-1 hamburg – wolfsburg intriguing , intriguing .
there 's was little to like about hamburg 's draw with st. pauli over the weekend – except for mladen petric 's stunning goal .
if petric gets into the line-up , the northern germans should be able to handle the wolves , who have yet to show they can beat a good team .
prediction : hamburg 2-1 moenchengladbach – st. pauli this is a crucial match for gladbach after the foals got hammered to the tune of 7-1 by previously winless stuttgart .
st. pauli should give their back four much more time to get sorted , and gladbach have proven they can score goals .
prediction : gladbach 2-0 freiburg – schalke speaking of teams facing must-win situations … schalke .
four games , zero points , and a team that 's yet to gel on the pitch is the sad summation of the royal blues campaign thus far .
meanwhile , freiburg are a surprising fourth in the table , albeit thanks to a couple of lucky results .
schalke have n't had enough time to get their house in order , but a point should be within reach .
prediction : 1-1 nuremberg – stuttgart nuremberg have drawn three of their first four , while stuttgart recovered from an awful start to put seven past gladbach last week .
the club will put up much sturdier resistance , but they may try too hard to get a first win in front of their home fans , which could open opportunities for the swabians .

prediction : gladbach 2-0 freiburg – schalke speaking of teams facing must-win situations … schalke .
four games , zero points , and a team that 's yet to gel on the pitch is the sad summation of the royal blues campaign thus far .
meanwhile , freiburg are a surprising fourth in the table , albeit thanks to a couple of lucky results .
schalke have n't had enough time to get their house in order , but a point should be within reach .
prediction : 1-1 nuremberg – stuttgart nuremberg have drawn three of their first four , while stuttgart recovered from an awful start to put seven past gladbach last week .
the club will put up much sturdier resistance , but they may try too hard to get a first win in front of their home fans , which could open opportunities for the swabians .

here , close to the equator , the sun sets for most of the year at around 6 in the evening and only rises 12 hours later .
in south american capitals like lima and quito , the population switches the lights on as soon as twilight kicks in .
but that 's not an option in villages up in the andes , most of which are n't connected to electricity grids .
across the planet , 1.6 billion people lack access to electricity , most of them in remote regions , and therefore lead their lives according to the changing of the seasons , sunrise and sunset – a way people in europe and north america stopped living hundreds of years ago .
decentralizing energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-wind hybrid systems are gaining ground the only way to bring electricity to rural areas is to focus on the development of decentralized , renewable energies .
solar panels on the roofs of huts have become a common sight in many developing nations .
these days , micro wind turbines are also becoming increasingly common , capable of covering the energy needs of households and farmsteads as well as being user-friendly and carbon-neutral .
" mini wind turbines are an excellent opportunity for developing nations , " ulf gerder from the german wind energy association -lrb- bwe -rrb- said .
in mongolia , for example , they are often the only source of energy available to nomads .
they carry their super-small wind turbines on the back of their horses .
energy needed for economic progress a reliable energy supply is a prerequisite for economic development . the populations of poor countries often depend for their electricity on diesel generators and batteries , which are costly and environmentally damaging .
mini wind turbines , on the other hand , are an efficient solution in terms both of easing poverty and helping the environment .
an east african ngo called green africa certainly thinks so , and is aiming to make them more common , installing mini wind turbines in villages in countries such as kenya , burundi and rwanda .
" access to electricity has a positive effect on many areas of life , " green africa 's kefa rabah explained .
it allows people to recharge mobile phones , for example , without having to head into a nearby town , which might be many kilometers away .
and in africa , cell phones are often a vital means of communication .
rabah also stressed how much access to electricity improves educational opportunities .
" the children of a goat herd only come home after dark , for example , " he said . " if there is electricity in their home , they can then still spend a few hours reading and doing homework . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the west bank village of susya , locals use solar panels and wind turbines to illuminate their makeshift homes but in fact , mini wind turbines are gaining in popularity not only in developing countries and emerging economies .
in europe and north america , they are seen as an attractive source of sustainable energy , and moreover , as affordable thanks to state subsidies supporting renewable energy infrastructure .
let there be light however , a major drawback to mini wind turbines in germany is that while power generated by a photovoltaic system stored in the grid is worth between 24 and 42 cents per kilowatt-hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- , energy generated by wind power is worth just 9 cents .
" solar and wind power should n't compete , they should complement one another , " gerder from the bwe said . hybrid energy providers that combine solar and wind power are indeed already available .
the winds of change are already blowing in the region of cajamarca in the remote northern highlands of peru .
the ngo " soluciones practicas " has installed mini wind turbines that provide over 4,000 families with a daily supply of electricity amounting to an average 0.3 kilowatts per hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- .
moreover , the organization ensures that every village is home to at least one technician able to repair and maintain the technology . " soluciones practicas " has also set up a training center where young people from all over the world can learn about renewable energy and take their expertise home with them .
micro turbines do n't just provide clean energy , they also offer people in remote regions the chance to be connected to the world .
in peru , the technology has already brought light to some of the darkest corners of the country .

dw-world.de use of wind energy continues to soar around the world clean wind energy is increasing in popularity around the world .
some 82 countries already harness energy from the wind to power homes and towns .
but the technology is still in its infancy in developing nations .
-lrb- 01.06.2010 -rrb- turbines start spinning at germany 's first offshore wind park germany 's first off-shore wind farm has gone into operation tuesday with environment minister norbert roettgen officially starting the 12 turbines constructed in the north sea .

much of that comes from huge turbines at wind farms , but experts are now predicting major growth in a diminutive version of the same thing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 21.09.2010 bright future and new currency brought fresh problems to east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : citizens in the former east germany were vocal in their calls for the deutschmark former chancellor helmut kohl promised citizens of the former east germany a bright new future in 1990 .
a lot of money has been spent on development of the eastern states and the process is not yet finished . things did not go entirely to plan when , on july 1 , 1990 monetary , economic and social union and the deutschmark were introduced in east germany .
citizens of east germany greeted the changes with celebration but for the former socialist republic 's economy the consequences were devastating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall may have fallen , but economic divisions remain bonds and savings up to the value of 6,000 east german marks could be exchanged one-to-one for the deutschmark , but now firms had to pay for salaries in the new west german currency .
overnight , eastern companies were plunged defenselessly into competition with the west german economy - and they could only emerge as losers .
demand for east german products dropped dramatically as citizens simply did not want to buy the familiar old products with their new deutschmarks .
whether it was a basic food , a luxury item , technical equipment or a vehicle - it had to be a product from the west .
no alternative to monetary union experts had anticipated that monetary union would ruin the east german economy .
however , the then west german finance minister theo waigel said there was no alternative in 1990 .
the popular east german call of that year became " if the deutschmark does n't come to us , we will go to the deutschmark ! " and there was already mass immigration to the west .
" in the finance ministry at the time we discussed all theoretical possibilities , step-by step plans and ways to make the situation better . " said waigel .
" but introducing these plans would not have helped .
it would have been like putting up another wall in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister in 1990 theo waigel said all possibilities were explored in the united germany , economic power remained unevenly distributed .
former west german businesses did indeed sell their products in the east , but these continued to be produced in the west .
industrial jobs in the eastern states emerged only slowly .
even today , the economic output in the former east german states is only 71 percent of the level in the west .
gross domestic product per capita generated by private industry - a standard measure of performance - stands at around 66 percent of that in the west . continued solidarity waigel said that the development of the east had been the greatest act of solidarity to have ever taken place in germany .
he added that this was continuing ; it remains the case that none of the eastern states can finance itself .
according to the current plan of the german government the so called solidarity pact - about sharing the costs of development - is supposed to run until 2019 .

the french interior minister says the country is facing a " real terrorist threat . " the security level in france has been heightened after receiving intelligence that there was a threat of a possible suicide attack .
the tip-off came from algerian intelligence services and the potential bomber was thought to be a woman targeting either the paris metro transport system or a public gathering place .
" the terrorism threat is real , we have increased our vigilance , " said interior minister brice hortefeux on monday , without giving any specific details .
the heightened alert follows last tuesday 's ban on the wearing of the islamic face veil in public and recent military action against suspected islamic militants in north africa .
niger kidnappings authorities have warned an attack was increasingly possible since july when french soldiers were involved in a raid on an al qaeda camp in mali .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security has been boosted in public after al qaeda threats the north african wing of al qaeda , or al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- have warned they will kill french citizens in revenge for fighters killed in the raid .
as a result of the french action , aqim assassinated a 78-year-old french engineer who they took hostage in niger .
in addition , five french nationals were kidnapped in niger last week , reportedly by aqim .
the head of france 's counter intelligence service , bernard squarcini , has appeared in several interviews recently evoking the heightened alert , telling le monde on sunday : " carrying out an attack on our territory is among their objectives . "

a lot of money has been spent on development of the eastern states and the process is not yet finished . things did not go entirely to plan when , on july 1 , 1990 monetary , economic and social union and the deutschmark were introduced in east germany .
citizens of east germany greeted the changes with celebration but for the former socialist republic 's economy the consequences were devastating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall may have fallen , but economic divisions remain bonds and savings up to the value of 6,000 east german marks could be exchanged one-to-one for the deutschmark , but now firms had to pay for salaries in the new west german currency .
overnight , eastern companies were plunged defenselessly into competition with the west german economy - and they could only emerge as losers .
demand for east german products dropped dramatically as citizens simply did not want to buy the familiar old products with their new deutschmarks .
whether it was a basic food , a luxury item , technical equipment or a vehicle - it had to be a product from the west .
no alternative to monetary union experts had anticipated that monetary union would ruin the east german economy .
however , the then west german finance minister theo waigel said there was no alternative in 1990 .
the popular east german call of that year became " if the deutschmark does n't come to us , we will go to the deutschmark ! " and there was already mass immigration to the west .
" in the finance ministry at the time we discussed all theoretical possibilities , step-by step plans and ways to make the situation better . " said waigel .
" but introducing these plans would not have helped .
it would have been like putting up another wall in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister in 1990 theo waigel said all possibilities were explored in the united germany , economic power remained unevenly distributed .
former west german businesses did indeed sell their products in the east , but these continued to be produced in the west .
industrial jobs in the eastern states emerged only slowly .
even today , the economic output in the former east german states is only 71 percent of the level in the west .
gross domestic product per capita generated by private industry - a standard measure of performance - stands at around 66 percent of that in the west . continued solidarity waigel said that the development of the east had been the greatest act of solidarity to have ever taken place in germany .
he added that this was continuing ; it remains the case that none of the eastern states can finance itself .
according to the current plan of the german government the so called solidarity pact - about sharing the costs of development - is supposed to run until 2019 .

at this oktoberfest , its hard to tell this year is the 200th anniversary of oktoberfest , but you don ’ t need to go to munich to experience the famous bavarian beer festival .
instead , you could head to sydney , australia at the opposite side of the world . australians tend to enjoy drinking .
they especially like beer in large quantities .
so it 's no wonder they embrace that greatest celebration of beer : oktoberfest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guests seem to enjoy it - no matter what continent they 're on in australia 's largest city , sydney , a number of “ oktoberfest ” celebrations are held across town .
they take place at german breweries , german restaurants , a university campus and pretty much anywhere people are looking for an excuse to imbibe and be merry .
the first venue to kick off the festivities this year was the loewenbraeu keller , a bavarian brewery and restaurant in an area known as the rocks , which is one of the oldest parts of the city and not far from sydney 's famous opera house .
the oktoberfest here at the loewenbraeu began the same weekend as the real event in munich and the festivities also began in the traditional way , with a keg tapping and a subsequent " beer shower " for those standing nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a delicious meal , if you can finish it the room is a smaller version of the famous oktoberfest beer tents .
there are drapes in bavarian blue and white hanging around the room and long wooden tables at which the guests eat and drink their fill .
the waiters and waitresses – most of whom are german or german-speaking – serve the guests with a smile while wearing dirndls and lederhosen , the traditional bavarian dresses and leather pants .
there are traditional bavarian beers imported from germany on offer .
loewenbraeu is available , as well as spaten , hofbraeu and others .
few guests are able to conquer the mountain of food served up by the kitchen : schnitzel , pork knuckle , sausages , bread dumplings and sauerkraut .
the bavarians ' representative reinhard wurtz , the general manager of the loewenbraeu , has been living in australia for ten years .
although originally from lake constance , he says he feels bavarian after serving in the army there and identifying with the culture .
" i think i 'm the right representative for the bavarians , " reinhard says .
he 's certainly getting into the bavarian spirit during oktoberfest , dressed in lederhosen and singing along when the live " oompah " band strikes up a tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loewenbraeu recreates munich 's beer tents reinhard is proud of the authenticity of the loewenbraeu 's oktoberfest , claiming the brewery is the most authentic bavarian beer house outside of bavaria .
he 's even about to head back to munich for this year 's oktoberfest to make sure he stays in touch with how it 's done at home .
" you have to get ideas when you 're away for a long time , " he says .
beer matters to australians most of the guests at the loewenbraeu oktoberfest are local sydneysiders , keen to enjoy some bavarian culture .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 21.09.2010 new right-wing parties face major obstacles in both germany and the us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a little-known tea party candidate has rocked the republican establishment while the tea party is gaining strength in the us , some conservatives in germany question whether the ruling christian democrats are still conservative enough .
could new right-wing parties emerge in both countries ? the latest shock to the system came for the republican party in the name of christine o 'donnell .
her stunning victory over the establishment-backed candidate in the republican primary in the state of delaware catapulted the tea party activist from obscurity into the limelight .
on the same day , in the new york republican primary , a tea party supporter also beat the candidate favored by the party hierarchy .
their upsets , but also the growing public profile of a movement which has been supported by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin and right-wing talk-show host glenn beck , signal a possible realignment within the conservative political spectrum of the united states .
the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .
unlike most other advanced democracies , germany and the us so far have only one mainstream conservative party .
could that change now with a new right-wing party emerging in both countries ? economic loss while germany and the us share a segment of the electorate that is unhappy with the current situation and the political elite , the chances for a new party to the right of the center to profit from this malaise are vastly different , argue experts .
" what you have in these advanced industrial democracies is a general fear or sense of economic loss and i think this is very justified , " andrei markovits , professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , told deutsche welle .
" the response i may not agree with , but there is clearly a sense of that for the first time maybe the next generation will not be as well off as its parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tea party movement has been supported by fox news talk show host glenn beck however , below the surface of discontent with the conservative mainstream , the constituents of the tea party have a distinct background and motivation that sets them apart from the disenchanted conservatives in germany , notes thomas poguntke , professor for comparative politics at heinrich heine university in duesseldorf .
" i think the religious component of the tea party is a lot stronger than the religious component of the intra-conservative dissent in germany .
i would argue that the german debate within the christian democratic party has a lot to do with that the profile of the christian parties in germany has become a lot more unclear than it was in the past , " he told deutsche welle .
libertarian roots what 's more , says stephen silvia , a comparative politics expert at american university in washington d.c. , " the tea party is a party that is fundamentally a libertarian party .
and when one looks at the german political landscape the party that is ideologically closest to the tea party is not the cdu , but the -lrb- free market-oriented liberal party - ed . -rrb-
fdp . "
while it appears at the moment that the tea party movement stands a much better chance than the disenfranchized german conservatives of having a concrete impact on politics and policies , the likelihood of the tea party becoming a unique political force in the us is next to none .
" in the anglo-american so-called first-past-the-post system it is very difficult to create a successful third party , " says markovits .
" in fact the american history is littered with the graveyard of so-called third parties . "
poguntke concurs that the us two-party system is so strongly entrenched in the way the political system works that the only viable option for dissenting voices is to work through the existing parties .
he adds : " what the tea party movement is about is changing the republican party , pulling it further to the right . "
" it seems to me that the republican party has a very serious issue on its hands , because it basically played with fire , " says markovits .
" they are really the sorceror 's apprentice in that they played with it and then this suddenly became big and endangered the party itself . "
hurdles for new right-wing party in germany due to germany 's electoral system of proportional representation , the structural hurdles for establishing a new party are lower as the rise of the greens and left party has indicated .
but none of the experts interviewed by deutsche welle predicts the emergence of a national party right of the cdu in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the cdu is devoid of conservative voices the switch from a successful movement to a successful party is very difficult , says markovits .
" it 's a totally different gig .
movements can talk , movements have phenomenal voice options , whether they have the same deed options in a very complex parliamentarian system is a completely different story .
if you want to be a player , that 's a very tall order . "
what 's more , says poguntke , " there also is a stronger taboo to mobilize on the right in germany as in most other european countries due to our nazi past . "
in addition , he adds , until now the conservative parties in germany have always been very clever to cover their right-wing flank .
" i think to a certain degree this debate in germany is based on the partially false assumption that there is a huge electorate which is structurally very conservative , " says poguntke . there certainly are conservatives who do n't feel at home in the cdu anymore , he contends . " but this portion of the population is not as big as it used to be . "
for all those reasons , the experts view the battle over the soul of the republican party as the more interesting intra-conservative rumblings .
" the only chance is for the republicans to walk this fine tight rope that they have to moderate and also try to keep these guys , " says markovits .
" whether they can do it , i actually doubt very much because at the moment i do n't see a major republican leader who could do it .
ronald reagan could have . "

at this oktoberfest , its hard to tell this year is the 200th anniversary of oktoberfest , but you don ’ t need to go to munich to experience the famous bavarian beer festival .
instead , you could head to sydney , australia at the opposite side of the world . australians tend to enjoy drinking .
they especially like beer in large quantities .
so it 's no wonder they embrace that greatest celebration of beer : oktoberfest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guests seem to enjoy it - no matter what continent they 're on in australia 's largest city , sydney , a number of “ oktoberfest ” celebrations are held across town .
they take place at german breweries , german restaurants , a university campus and pretty much anywhere people are looking for an excuse to imbibe and be merry .
the first venue to kick off the festivities this year was the loewenbraeu keller , a bavarian brewery and restaurant in an area known as the rocks , which is one of the oldest parts of the city and not far from sydney 's famous opera house .
the oktoberfest here at the loewenbraeu began the same weekend as the real event in munich and the festivities also began in the traditional way , with a keg tapping and a subsequent " beer shower " for those standing nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a delicious meal , if you can finish it the room is a smaller version of the famous oktoberfest beer tents .
there are drapes in bavarian blue and white hanging around the room and long wooden tables at which the guests eat and drink their fill .
the waiters and waitresses – most of whom are german or german-speaking – serve the guests with a smile while wearing dirndls and lederhosen , the traditional bavarian dresses and leather pants .
there are traditional bavarian beers imported from germany on offer .
loewenbraeu is available , as well as spaten , hofbraeu and others .
few guests are able to conquer the mountain of food served up by the kitchen : schnitzel , pork knuckle , sausages , bread dumplings and sauerkraut .
the bavarians ' representative reinhard wurtz , the general manager of the loewenbraeu , has been living in australia for ten years .
although originally from lake constance , he says he feels bavarian after serving in the army there and identifying with the culture .
" i think i 'm the right representative for the bavarians , " reinhard says .
he 's certainly getting into the bavarian spirit during oktoberfest , dressed in lederhosen and singing along when the live " oompah " band strikes up a tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loewenbraeu recreates munich 's beer tents reinhard is proud of the authenticity of the loewenbraeu 's oktoberfest , claiming the brewery is the most authentic bavarian beer house outside of bavaria .
he 's even about to head back to munich for this year 's oktoberfest to make sure he stays in touch with how it 's done at home .
" you have to get ideas when you 're away for a long time , " he says .
beer matters to australians most of the guests at the loewenbraeu oktoberfest are local sydneysiders , keen to enjoy some bavarian culture .
one woman says she 's always wanted to go to the real oktoberfest , but has never had the chance .
this is the next best thing , she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelry starts with a traditional keg-tapping others have been to munich and are happy to relive the memories .
but at least one visitor , known in this article as paul – but who also gave his name as steve and peter when asked – is more honest about his reasons for attending .
" the reason we 're out tonight is mainly because beer is very important to australians , " says paul , or steve , or peter .
" it 's also about good looking girls , but mainly it 's about the boys and having a few beers . "

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .
the proposed code may make a law on the issue redundant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german interior minister hosted the one-day summit in berlin however , de maiziere recognized that such technology can be beneficial , and said he does not want to give people the right to delete images that can be viewed by the public anyway .
he does , however , want service providers to make it clearer how their privacy rights may be infringed by using particular services .
de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "
however , the interior minister wants to lay down a law to draw a " red line , " " which can not be crossed under any circumstances . "
this will be designed to stop particularly extreme violations of privacy .
if the internet companies can not decide on a code by december , de maiziere said the government would immediately intervene in the matter .
the german consumer protection minister ilse aigner welcomed the move as " a good basis , which we can build upon , and which will allow us to take into account the interests of the users . "
she demanded a balance between new technological advances , which can benefit consumers , and the protection of the privacy of individuals .
the head of internet giant google in europe , philipp schindler , also greeted the suggestion with enthusiasm and agreed his company would work with others to draw up the code .
" geo-data from the internet is becoming more important for citizens , authorities and companies , a trend which will grow further with the rise of mobile internet use , " schindler added .

the french interior minister says the country is facing a " real terrorist threat . " the security level in france has been heightened after receiving intelligence that there was a threat of a possible suicide attack .
the tip-off came from algerian intelligence services and the potential bomber was thought to be a woman targeting either the paris metro transport system or a public gathering place .
" the terrorism threat is real , we have increased our vigilance , " said interior minister brice hortefeux on monday , without giving any specific details .
the heightened alert follows last tuesday 's ban on the wearing of the islamic face veil in public and recent military action against suspected islamic militants in north africa .
niger kidnappings authorities have warned an attack was increasingly possible since july when french soldiers were involved in a raid on an al qaeda camp in mali .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security has been boosted in public after al qaeda threats the north african wing of al qaeda , or al qaeda in the islamic maghreb -lrb- aqim -rrb- have warned they will kill french citizens in revenge for fighters killed in the raid .
as a result of the french action , aqim assassinated a 78-year-old french engineer who they took hostage in niger .
in addition , five french nationals were kidnapped in niger last week , reportedly by aqim .
the head of france 's counter intelligence service , bernard squarcini , has appeared in several interviews recently evoking the heightened alert , telling le monde on sunday : " carrying out an attack on our territory is among their objectives . "
authorities have visibly boosted police and military units patrolling landmarks , including the eiffel tower , where 2,000 people were evacuated last week after a hoax bomb threat .

here , close to the equator , the sun sets for most of the year at around 6 in the evening and only rises 12 hours later .
in south american capitals like lima and quito , the population switches the lights on as soon as twilight kicks in .
but that 's not an option in villages up in the andes , most of which are n't connected to electricity grids .
across the planet , 1.6 billion people lack access to electricity , most of them in remote regions , and therefore lead their lives according to the changing of the seasons , sunrise and sunset – a way people in europe and north america stopped living hundreds of years ago .
decentralizing energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar-wind hybrid systems are gaining ground the only way to bring electricity to rural areas is to focus on the development of decentralized , renewable energies .
solar panels on the roofs of huts have become a common sight in many developing nations .
these days , micro wind turbines are also becoming increasingly common , capable of covering the energy needs of households and farmsteads as well as being user-friendly and carbon-neutral .
" mini wind turbines are an excellent opportunity for developing nations , " ulf gerder from the german wind energy association -lrb- bwe -rrb- said .
in mongolia , for example , they are often the only source of energy available to nomads .
they carry their super-small wind turbines on the back of their horses .
energy needed for economic progress a reliable energy supply is a prerequisite for economic development . the populations of poor countries often depend for their electricity on diesel generators and batteries , which are costly and environmentally damaging .
mini wind turbines , on the other hand , are an efficient solution in terms both of easing poverty and helping the environment .
an east african ngo called green africa certainly thinks so , and is aiming to make them more common , installing mini wind turbines in villages in countries such as kenya , burundi and rwanda .
" access to electricity has a positive effect on many areas of life , " green africa 's kefa rabah explained .
it allows people to recharge mobile phones , for example , without having to head into a nearby town , which might be many kilometers away .
and in africa , cell phones are often a vital means of communication .
rabah also stressed how much access to electricity improves educational opportunities .
" the children of a goat herd only come home after dark , for example , " he said . " if there is electricity in their home , they can then still spend a few hours reading and doing homework . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the west bank village of susya , locals use solar panels and wind turbines to illuminate their makeshift homes but in fact , mini wind turbines are gaining in popularity not only in developing countries and emerging economies .
in europe and north america , they are seen as an attractive source of sustainable energy , and moreover , as affordable thanks to state subsidies supporting renewable energy infrastructure .
let there be light however , a major drawback to mini wind turbines in germany is that while power generated by a photovoltaic system stored in the grid is worth between 24 and 42 cents per kilowatt-hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- , energy generated by wind power is worth just 9 cents .
" solar and wind power should n't compete , they should complement one another , " gerder from the bwe said . hybrid energy providers that combine solar and wind power are indeed already available .
the winds of change are already blowing in the region of cajamarca in the remote northern highlands of peru .
the ngo " soluciones practicas " has installed mini wind turbines that provide over 4,000 families with a daily supply of electricity amounting to an average 0.3 kilowatts per hour -lrb- kwh -rrb- .
moreover , the organization ensures that every village is home to at least one technician able to repair and maintain the technology . " soluciones practicas " has also set up a training center where young people from all over the world can learn about renewable energy and take their expertise home with them .
micro turbines do n't just provide clean energy , they also offer people in remote regions the chance to be connected to the world .
in peru , the technology has already brought light to some of the darkest corners of the country .

dw-world.de use of wind energy continues to soar around the world clean wind energy is increasing in popularity around the world .
some 82 countries already harness energy from the wind to power homes and towns .
but the technology is still in its infancy in developing nations .
-lrb- 01.06.2010 -rrb- turbines start spinning at germany 's first offshore wind park germany 's first off-shore wind farm has gone into operation tuesday with environment minister norbert roettgen officially starting the 12 turbines constructed in the north sea .

after a less than stellar start , they 'll try to reverse their fortunes by picking the winners and losers correctly this week . match day five in the bundesliga is upon us , and the only ones doing worse than schalke are dw 's team of football freaks .
we pulled off a rare feat last time around and managed to get all the results wrong -lrb- see our results at the bottom of the page -rrb- .
but winners never quit , and quitters never win .
so we 're back at it again for the midweek matches .
here 's goes nothing .
tuesday , september 21 mainz – cologne mainz are topping the table to everyone 's surprise and look like a very solid team with a variety of players who can score .
cologne are doing what they do best and eking enough points to stay just above the relegation zone .
the billy goats held bayern to a scoreless draw in the last round , and they should be able to do the same against mainz .
prediction : 0-0 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings and bremen will look to get a boot in against hanover hoffenheim – bayern munich hoffenheim are off to a fine start , while bayern have n't scored in their past three matches .
not having arjen robben is a big factor , of course , and ivica olic has yet to find last season 's form .
but no one 's panicking in munich yet , and we think bayern will find their range again on tuesday .
prediction : bayern 2-1 hanover – werder bremen after two wins and a draw , hanover reverted to their meek losing form last weekend , while bremen will be looking for redemption after losing to mainz at home .
both teams are suspect at the back so this could be a real goal-fest , which always favors bremen .
prediction : bremen 4-2 wednesday , september 22 leverkusen – frankfurt frankfurt have looked better than their 1-0-3 record while leverkusen will have to get used to life without stefan kiessling , whose ankle injury will sideline him for the foreseeable future .
put those two things together and what you come out with is a dull draw .
prediction : 1-1 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thins have been hunky-dory for the men in yellow dortmund – kaiserslautern dortmund 's main challenge in this match is to get their feet back on the ground after thrashing arch-rivals schalke away on sunday .
kaiserslautern are proving difficult to beat , but then again dortmund , with its huge crowds , is a very difficult place to play , especially for a newly promoted team .
prediction : dortmund 2-1 hamburg – wolfsburg intriguing , intriguing .
there 's was little to like about hamburg 's draw with st. pauli over the weekend – except for mladen petric 's stunning goal .
if petric gets into the line-up , the northern germans should be able to handle the wolves , who have yet to show they can beat a good team .
prediction : hamburg 2-1 moenchengladbach – st. pauli this is a crucial match for gladbach after the foals got hammered to the tune of 7-1 by previously winless stuttgart .
st. pauli should give their back four much more time to get sorted , and gladbach have proven they can score goals .
prediction : gladbach 2-0 freiburg – schalke speaking of teams facing must-win situations … schalke .
four games , zero points , and a team that 's yet to gel on the pitch is the sad summation of the royal blues campaign thus far .
meanwhile , freiburg are a surprising fourth in the table , albeit thanks to a couple of lucky results .
schalke have n't had enough time to get their house in order , but a point should be within reach .

a lot of money has been spent on development of the eastern states and the process is not yet finished . things did not go entirely to plan when , on july 1 , 1990 monetary , economic and social union and the deutschmark were introduced in east germany .
citizens of east germany greeted the changes with celebration but for the former socialist republic 's economy the consequences were devastating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall may have fallen , but economic divisions remain bonds and savings up to the value of 6,000 east german marks could be exchanged one-to-one for the deutschmark , but now firms had to pay for salaries in the new west german currency .
overnight , eastern companies were plunged defenselessly into competition with the west german economy - and they could only emerge as losers .
demand for east german products dropped dramatically as citizens simply did not want to buy the familiar old products with their new deutschmarks .
whether it was a basic food , a luxury item , technical equipment or a vehicle - it had to be a product from the west .
no alternative to monetary union experts had anticipated that monetary union would ruin the east german economy .
however , the then west german finance minister theo waigel said there was no alternative in 1990 .
the popular east german call of that year became " if the deutschmark does n't come to us , we will go to the deutschmark ! " and there was already mass immigration to the west .
" in the finance ministry at the time we discussed all theoretical possibilities , step-by step plans and ways to make the situation better . " said waigel .
" but introducing these plans would not have helped .
it would have been like putting up another wall in germany . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister in 1990 theo waigel said all possibilities were explored in the united germany , economic power remained unevenly distributed .
former west german businesses did indeed sell their products in the east , but these continued to be produced in the west .
industrial jobs in the eastern states emerged only slowly .
even today , the economic output in the former east german states is only 71 percent of the level in the west .
gross domestic product per capita generated by private industry - a standard measure of performance - stands at around 66 percent of that in the west . continued solidarity waigel said that the development of the east had been the greatest act of solidarity to have ever taken place in germany .
he added that this was continuing ; it remains the case that none of the eastern states can finance itself .
according to the current plan of the german government the so called solidarity pact - about sharing the costs of development - is supposed to run until 2019 .

tuesday , september 21 mainz – cologne mainz are topping the table to everyone 's surprise and look like a very solid team with a variety of players who can score .
cologne are doing what they do best and eking enough points to stay just above the relegation zone .

there 's was little to like about hamburg 's draw with st. pauli over the weekend – except for mladen petric 's stunning goal .

prediction : hamburg 2-1 moenchengladbach – st. pauli this is a crucial match for gladbach after the foals got hammered to the tune of 7-1 by previously winless stuttgart .

at this oktoberfest , its hard to tell this year is the 200th anniversary of oktoberfest , but you don ’ t need to go to munich to experience the famous bavarian beer festival .
instead , you could head to sydney , australia at the opposite side of the world . australians tend to enjoy drinking .
they especially like beer in large quantities .
so it 's no wonder they embrace that greatest celebration of beer : oktoberfest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guests seem to enjoy it - no matter what continent they 're on in australia 's largest city , sydney , a number of “ oktoberfest ” celebrations are held across town .
they take place at german breweries , german restaurants , a university campus and pretty much anywhere people are looking for an excuse to imbibe and be merry .
the first venue to kick off the festivities this year was the loewenbraeu keller , a bavarian brewery and restaurant in an area known as the rocks , which is one of the oldest parts of the city and not far from sydney 's famous opera house .
the oktoberfest here at the loewenbraeu began the same weekend as the real event in munich and the festivities also began in the traditional way , with a keg tapping and a subsequent " beer shower " for those standing nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a delicious meal , if you can finish it the room is a smaller version of the famous oktoberfest beer tents .
there are drapes in bavarian blue and white hanging around the room and long wooden tables at which the guests eat and drink their fill .
the waiters and waitresses – most of whom are german or german-speaking – serve the guests with a smile while wearing dirndls and lederhosen , the traditional bavarian dresses and leather pants .
there are traditional bavarian beers imported from germany on offer .
loewenbraeu is available , as well as spaten , hofbraeu and others .
few guests are able to conquer the mountain of food served up by the kitchen : schnitzel , pork knuckle , sausages , bread dumplings and sauerkraut .
the bavarians ' representative reinhard wurtz , the general manager of the loewenbraeu , has been living in australia for ten years .
although originally from lake constance , he says he feels bavarian after serving in the army there and identifying with the culture .
" i think i 'm the right representative for the bavarians , " reinhard says .
he 's certainly getting into the bavarian spirit during oktoberfest , dressed in lederhosen and singing along when the live " oompah " band strikes up a tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loewenbraeu recreates munich 's beer tents reinhard is proud of the authenticity of the loewenbraeu 's oktoberfest , claiming the brewery is the most authentic bavarian beer house outside of bavaria .
he 's even about to head back to munich for this year 's oktoberfest to make sure he stays in touch with how it 's done at home .
" you have to get ideas when you 're away for a long time , " he says .
beer matters to australians most of the guests at the loewenbraeu oktoberfest are local sydneysiders , keen to enjoy some bavarian culture .
one woman says she 's always wanted to go to the real oktoberfest , but has never had the chance .
this is the next best thing , she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelry starts with a traditional keg-tapping others have been to munich and are happy to relive the memories .
but at least one visitor , known in this article as paul – but who also gave his name as steve and peter when asked – is more honest about his reasons for attending .
" the reason we 're out tonight is mainly because beer is very important to australians , " says paul , or steve , or peter .
" it 's also about good looking girls , but mainly it 's about the boys and having a few beers . "

merkel said that more conditions should be attached to aid to ensure effective results . chancellor angela merkel has called for the governments of developing nations to take more responsibility in fighting poverty .
the chancellor also said that developed nations should attach tighter conditions to the money they lend and argued in favor of linking the amount to results already achieved .
she said that countries should not rely indefinitely on handouts and had to take charge of their own development . she added social progress was " unthinkable " without good governance and human rights .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit has brought together some 140 world leaders " there is one thing we have to accept , " said merkel .
" the primary responsibility for development lies with the governments of the developing countries .
it is in their hands whether aid can be effective .
therefore , support for good governance is as important as aid itself . "
merkel made her comments at the un general assembly 's special session on the millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- in new york on tuesday , an event attended by some 140 heads of state or government .
they are reviewing the progress of the mdgs agreed 10 years ago to cut poverty , and improve gender quality , health and education .
aid should be used more effectively firm conditions to ensure that money was spent in an effective way should be applied , according to the chancellor .
" development aid can not continue indefinitely .
the task is to use limited resources as effectively as possible . "
" we have to put results-based development aid at center stage , " merkel said .
" it should just only be about money but also about what comes of that money . "
the chancellor added lasting progress on development would require the world to successfully address challenges in four fields - peace and security , poverty reduction , environmental protection and promotion of human rights and good governance .
germany is the third biggest contributor to the un budget and it is one of the largest development aid donors .
potential for german seat on the security council the chancellor is keen for germany to become a non-permanent member of the influential un security council .
she claimed on tuesday that she had received " a lot of support and encouragment " for germany 's bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is hoping germany will get a seat on the un security council a seat on the un 's peacekeeping council would allow germany to " present its views more strongly . "
the new non-permanent members will be elected by the general assemby in october .
however , the aid organization oxfam expressed disappointment in merkel 's speech .
" we expected much more from the german contribution , " oxfam spokeswoman emma seery commented after the speech .
" germany did not say how it will keep its promises to help poorer countries . "
helping women help themselves many experts are concerned that a number of the mdgs on poverty are unlikely to be achieved by the 2015 deadline .
several speakers at the meeting said the goals would not be achieved unless more is done to improve the lives of poor women .
liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf , africa 's first female head of state , called for more investment in sectors that help women , including agriculture and small businesses .
" as we renew our resolve in the year 2010 , we must recognize the need for inclusive economic growth , " she said .
the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , announced that 1 billion euros -lrb- 1.3 billion dollars -rrb- would be given to help africa , the caribbean and pacific countries lagging behind their mdgs .
barroso urged other donors not to use the economic crisis as an excuse to shirk their responsibilities to the poor .
" the international community still has a long way to go before the millennium goals are reached , " he said .

the bid will be paid for by a 10.2 billion euro capital increase . investors in postbank will be able to sell their shares to deutsche bank at 25 euros a piece from wednesday .
germany 's financial regulator bafin on tuesday set the price based on a three month average .
deutsche bank already owns 29.95 percent of postbank and is looking to take control of the bank , which has the largest retail network in the country .
tuesday 's announcement applies to the roughly 30 percent of shares owned by various private and institutional investors , known as free float .
those investors have until october 5 to sell their shares .
biggest ever cash call deutsche bank will finance its bid via a capital increase worth 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4bn -rrb- .
on monday , the bank announced it would issue 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros a piece .

new global banking rules , known as the basel iii accord , require banks to hold more capital .
the agreement stipulates that banks will have to hold common equity equivalent to at least seven percent of their assets by 2019 .
that is more than triple the two percent required at the moment and is meant to shield banks from another financial crisis by acting as a cushion for potential losses .

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .
the proposed code may make a law on the issue redundant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german interior minister hosted the one-day summit in berlin however , de maiziere recognized that such technology can be beneficial , and said he does not want to give people the right to delete images that can be viewed by the public anyway .
he does , however , want service providers to make it clearer how their privacy rights may be infringed by using particular services .
de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "
however , the interior minister wants to lay down a law to draw a " red line , " " which can not be crossed under any circumstances . "
this will be designed to stop particularly extreme violations of privacy .
if the internet companies can not decide on a code by december , de maiziere said the government would immediately intervene in the matter .
the german consumer protection minister ilse aigner welcomed the move as " a good basis , which we can build upon , and which will allow us to take into account the interests of the users . "
she demanded a balance between new technological advances , which can benefit consumers , and the protection of the privacy of individuals .
the head of internet giant google in europe , philipp schindler , also greeted the suggestion with enthusiasm and agreed his company would work with others to draw up the code .
" geo-data from the internet is becoming more important for citizens , authorities and companies , a trend which will grow further with the rise of mobile internet use , " schindler added .

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .
the proposed code may make a law on the issue redundant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german interior minister hosted the one-day summit in berlin however , de maiziere recognized that such technology can be beneficial , and said he does not want to give people the right to delete images that can be viewed by the public anyway .
he does , however , want service providers to make it clearer how their privacy rights may be infringed by using particular services .
de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "
however , the interior minister wants to lay down a law to draw a " red line , " " which can not be crossed under any circumstances . "
this will be designed to stop particularly extreme violations of privacy .
if the internet companies can not decide on a code by december , de maiziere said the government would immediately intervene in the matter .
the german consumer protection minister ilse aigner welcomed the move as " a good basis , which we can build upon , and which will allow us to take into account the interests of the users . "
she demanded a balance between new technological advances , which can benefit consumers , and the protection of the privacy of individuals .
the head of internet giant google in europe , philipp schindler , also greeted the suggestion with enthusiasm and agreed his company would work with others to draw up the code .
" geo-data from the internet is becoming more important for citizens , authorities and companies , a trend which will grow further with the rise of mobile internet use , " schindler added .

merkel said that more conditions should be attached to aid to ensure effective results . chancellor angela merkel has called for the governments of developing nations to take more responsibility in fighting poverty .
the chancellor also said that developed nations should attach tighter conditions to the money they lend and argued in favor of linking the amount to results already achieved .
she said that countries should not rely indefinitely on handouts and had to take charge of their own development . she added social progress was " unthinkable " without good governance and human rights .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit has brought together some 140 world leaders " there is one thing we have to accept , " said merkel .
" the primary responsibility for development lies with the governments of the developing countries .
it is in their hands whether aid can be effective .
therefore , support for good governance is as important as aid itself . "
merkel made her comments at the un general assembly 's special session on the millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- in new york on tuesday , an event attended by some 140 heads of state or government .
they are reviewing the progress of the mdgs agreed 10 years ago to cut poverty , and improve gender quality , health and education .
aid should be used more effectively firm conditions to ensure that money was spent in an effective way should be applied , according to the chancellor .
" development aid can not continue indefinitely .
the task is to use limited resources as effectively as possible . "
" we have to put results-based development aid at center stage , " merkel said .
" it should just only be about money but also about what comes of that money . "
the chancellor added lasting progress on development would require the world to successfully address challenges in four fields - peace and security , poverty reduction , environmental protection and promotion of human rights and good governance .
germany is the third biggest contributor to the un budget and it is one of the largest development aid donors .
potential for german seat on the security council the chancellor is keen for germany to become a non-permanent member of the influential un security council .
she claimed on tuesday that she had received " a lot of support and encouragment " for germany 's bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is hoping germany will get a seat on the un security council a seat on the un 's peacekeeping council would allow germany to " present its views more strongly . "
the new non-permanent members will be elected by the general assemby in october .
however , the aid organization oxfam expressed disappointment in merkel 's speech .
" we expected much more from the german contribution , " oxfam spokeswoman emma seery commented after the speech .
" germany did not say how it will keep its promises to help poorer countries . "
helping women help themselves many experts are concerned that a number of the mdgs on poverty are unlikely to be achieved by the 2015 deadline .
several speakers at the meeting said the goals would not be achieved unless more is done to improve the lives of poor women .
liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf , africa 's first female head of state , called for more investment in sectors that help women , including agriculture and small businesses .
" as we renew our resolve in the year 2010 , we must recognize the need for inclusive economic growth , " she said .
the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , announced that 1 billion euros -lrb- 1.3 billion dollars -rrb- would be given to help africa , the caribbean and pacific countries lagging behind their mdgs .
barroso urged other donors not to use the economic crisis as an excuse to shirk their responsibilities to the poor .
" the international community still has a long way to go before the millennium goals are reached , " he said .

could new right-wing parties emerge in both countries ? the latest shock to the system came for the republican party in the name of christine o 'donnell .
her stunning victory over the establishment-backed candidate in the republican primary in the state of delaware catapulted the tea party activist from obscurity into the limelight .
on the same day , in the new york republican primary , a tea party supporter also beat the candidate favored by the party hierarchy .
their upsets , but also the growing public profile of a movement which has been supported by former vice presidential candidate sarah palin and right-wing talk-show host glenn beck , signal a possible realignment within the conservative political spectrum of the united states .
the tea party 's success , according to a new york times article , has left the white house mulling a possible ad campaign before the november midterm elections .
meanwhile in germany , chancellor angela merkel 's center-right party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , is also engaged in a discussion about its conservative profile after a number of high-profile conservative stalwarts have stepped down from public office recently .
in addition , critics question whether the party which has liberalized its traditional stance on social policy in the past years can still serve as the political home for conservative voters .
unlike most other advanced democracies , germany and the us so far have only one mainstream conservative party .
could that change now with a new right-wing party emerging in both countries ? economic loss while germany and the us share a segment of the electorate that is unhappy with the current situation and the political elite , the chances for a new party to the right of the center to profit from this malaise are vastly different , argue experts .
" what you have in these advanced industrial democracies is a general fear or sense of economic loss and i think this is very justified , " andrei markovits , professor of comparative politics and german studies at the university of michigan , told deutsche welle .
" the response i may not agree with , but there is clearly a sense of that for the first time maybe the next generation will not be as well off as its parents . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tea party movement has been supported by fox news talk show host glenn beck however , below the surface of discontent with the conservative mainstream , the constituents of the tea party have a distinct background and motivation that sets them apart from the disenchanted conservatives in germany , notes thomas poguntke , professor for comparative politics at heinrich heine university in duesseldorf .
" i think the religious component of the tea party is a lot stronger than the religious component of the intra-conservative dissent in germany .
i would argue that the german debate within the christian democratic party has a lot to do with that the profile of the christian parties in germany has become a lot more unclear than it was in the past , " he told deutsche welle .
libertarian roots what 's more , says stephen silvia , a comparative politics expert at american university in washington d.c. , " the tea party is a party that is fundamentally a libertarian party .
and when one looks at the german political landscape the party that is ideologically closest to the tea party is not the cdu , but the -lrb- free market-oriented liberal party - ed . -rrb-
fdp . "
while it appears at the moment that the tea party movement stands a much better chance than the disenfranchized german conservatives of having a concrete impact on politics and policies , the likelihood of the tea party becoming a unique political force in the us is next to none .
" in the anglo-american so-called first-past-the-post system it is very difficult to create a successful third party , " says markovits .
" in fact the american history is littered with the graveyard of so-called third parties . "
poguntke concurs that the us two-party system is so strongly entrenched in the way the political system works that the only viable option for dissenting voices is to work through the existing parties .
he adds : " what the tea party movement is about is changing the republican party , pulling it further to the right . "
" it seems to me that the republican party has a very serious issue on its hands , because it basically played with fire , " says markovits .
" they are really the sorceror 's apprentice in that they played with it and then this suddenly became big and endangered the party itself . "
hurdles for new right-wing party in germany due to germany 's electoral system of proportional representation , the structural hurdles for establishing a new party are lower as the rise of the greens and left party has indicated .
but none of the experts interviewed by deutsche welle predicts the emergence of a national party right of the cdu in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics argue that the cdu is devoid of conservative voices the switch from a successful movement to a successful party is very difficult , says markovits .
" it 's a totally different gig .
movements can talk , movements have phenomenal voice options , whether they have the same deed options in a very complex parliamentarian system is a completely different story .
if you want to be a player , that 's a very tall order . "
what 's more , says poguntke , " there also is a stronger taboo to mobilize on the right in germany as in most other european countries due to our nazi past . "
in addition , he adds , until now the conservative parties in germany have always been very clever to cover their right-wing flank .
" i think to a certain degree this debate in germany is based on the partially false assumption that there is a huge electorate which is structurally very conservative , " says poguntke . there certainly are conservatives who do n't feel at home in the cdu anymore , he contends . " but this portion of the population is not as big as it used to be . "
for all those reasons , the experts view the battle over the soul of the republican party as the more interesting intra-conservative rumblings .
" the only chance is for the republicans to walk this fine tight rope that they have to moderate and also try to keep these guys , " says markovits .
" whether they can do it , i actually doubt very much because at the moment i do n't see a major republican leader who could do it .
ronald reagan could have . "

at this oktoberfest , its hard to tell this year is the 200th anniversary of oktoberfest , but you don ’ t need to go to munich to experience the famous bavarian beer festival .
instead , you could head to sydney , australia at the opposite side of the world . australians tend to enjoy drinking .
they especially like beer in large quantities .
so it 's no wonder they embrace that greatest celebration of beer : oktoberfest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the guests seem to enjoy it - no matter what continent they 're on in australia 's largest city , sydney , a number of “ oktoberfest ” celebrations are held across town .
they take place at german breweries , german restaurants , a university campus and pretty much anywhere people are looking for an excuse to imbibe and be merry .
the first venue to kick off the festivities this year was the loewenbraeu keller , a bavarian brewery and restaurant in an area known as the rocks , which is one of the oldest parts of the city and not far from sydney 's famous opera house .
the oktoberfest here at the loewenbraeu began the same weekend as the real event in munich and the festivities also began in the traditional way , with a keg tapping and a subsequent " beer shower " for those standing nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a delicious meal , if you can finish it the room is a smaller version of the famous oktoberfest beer tents .
there are drapes in bavarian blue and white hanging around the room and long wooden tables at which the guests eat and drink their fill .
the waiters and waitresses – most of whom are german or german-speaking – serve the guests with a smile while wearing dirndls and lederhosen , the traditional bavarian dresses and leather pants .
there are traditional bavarian beers imported from germany on offer .
loewenbraeu is available , as well as spaten , hofbraeu and others .
few guests are able to conquer the mountain of food served up by the kitchen : schnitzel , pork knuckle , sausages , bread dumplings and sauerkraut .
the bavarians ' representative reinhard wurtz , the general manager of the loewenbraeu , has been living in australia for ten years .
although originally from lake constance , he says he feels bavarian after serving in the army there and identifying with the culture .
" i think i 'm the right representative for the bavarians , " reinhard says .
he 's certainly getting into the bavarian spirit during oktoberfest , dressed in lederhosen and singing along when the live " oompah " band strikes up a tune .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loewenbraeu recreates munich 's beer tents reinhard is proud of the authenticity of the loewenbraeu 's oktoberfest , claiming the brewery is the most authentic bavarian beer house outside of bavaria .
he 's even about to head back to munich for this year 's oktoberfest to make sure he stays in touch with how it 's done at home .
" you have to get ideas when you 're away for a long time , " he says .
beer matters to australians most of the guests at the loewenbraeu oktoberfest are local sydneysiders , keen to enjoy some bavarian culture .
one woman says she 's always wanted to go to the real oktoberfest , but has never had the chance .
this is the next best thing , she says .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : revelry starts with a traditional keg-tapping others have been to munich and are happy to relive the memories .
but at least one visitor , known in this article as paul – but who also gave his name as steve and peter when asked – is more honest about his reasons for attending .
" the reason we 're out tonight is mainly because beer is very important to australians , " says paul , or steve , or peter .
" it 's also about good looking girls , but mainly it 's about the boys and having a few beers . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 21.09.2010 the rise of the far-right in the east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis gained ground in the east after the fall of the wall along with many other prejudices , eastern germany has had to contend with a reputation for neo-nazism .
it 's not entirely unjustified , but right-wing extremism in the east has roots in economic hardship . right-wing violence was most dramatic in the first years of the newly unified germany - and more and more often , they occurred in the former east germany .
for three consecutive nights in august 1992 , several hundred neo-nazis - watched by up to 2,000 locals - attacked an apartment block for asylum seekers in the north-eastern town of rostock .
with the police unprepared and initially outnumbered , the violence continued unchecked until it culminated in an arson attack .
the rostock riots quickly achieved international notoriety .
pictures of drunken , violent east germans doing hitler salutes were printed around the world .
this was not the dawn of a new , hopeful country that had been celebrated less than two years before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1992 arson attack on an asylum shelter in rostock became infamous authority vacuum neo-nazi violence was not just a stain on the former east germany .
over 100 of the 370 rioters arrested in rostock had travelled from the former west , where there was a string of horrific attacks on turkish immigrants in the early nineties .
but rostock cemented the reputation of post-wall eastern germany as a new haven for neo-nazism , and that reputation stuck .
what characterized the rostock riots as specifically east german was the powerlessness of the authorities . for two or three years after the fall of the wall , state institutions in the former german democratic republic were weakened by the period of transition .
police officers suddenly found themselves associated with a discredited regime .
dierk borstel , a researcher into right-wing extremism at the university of bielefeld , described the precarious circumstances in the early 1990s as linked to a lack of functioning insitutions .
" the police force was destabilized and the church had little influence anyway , " borstel told deutsche welle .
" the eastern german trade unions and the pds , the successor party to the former ruling communist sed , had little authority , and the trade unions and industry associations coming in from the west were all very weak in the east . "
worst of many worlds these semi-anarchic conditions were fertile ground for far-right activists in the former east germany , and their cause was further helped by the disappointment and poverty that spread in the east after reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd has scored some electoral success in the last six years " the expectation of east germans after reunification was : ' we 're going to get the security of the east plus the freedoms of the west , " ' borstel says .
" the result was that they lost the securities and could n't afford the freedoms . "
even though the skinhead neo-nazi scene originated in western europe , it already existed in east germany before the fall of the iron curtain .
it was often linked to certain football teams , and occasionally broke out in extreme violence , such as the attack of 30 skinheads on a concert in a church in central east berlin in 1987 .
the far-right movement in the east capitalized on what many describe as the gdr 's denial of its own nazi history .
olaf sundermeyer , author of " in the npd , " a book about the development of germany 's populist far-right national democratic party , believes the gdr 's distanced attitude to hitler 's germany helped feed the neo-nazi movement .
" communist leaders in the gdr said , ' we are an anti-fascist state and we have no responsibility for history .
there are no nazis here . '
of course that was n't true .
there were former nazis in both east and west germany , but there was no denazification in east germany - the nazi history was not dealt with , " he said .
imbalance and injustice east german society was never particularly multicultural , and the government 's immigration policies showed a determination to keep the population monotone .
immigrant workers from other socialist countries like mozambique were sent home if they got pregnant , or as soon as their allotted time ran out .
the lack of a multicultural foundation is still reflected in eastern german society today .
" eastern germany has a lot fewer immigrants - and it has long been acknowledged that where there are no immigrants and no jews , there is more racism and anti-semitism , " borstel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has caused unrest in the former gdr neo-nazis were also able to win over some east germans with familiar ideas .
" national socialism often starts out with the idea of socialism , and then that is combined with frustration , unemployment , lack of opportunity , and populations moving away . "
this is the opinion of a former neo-nazi who wants to remain anonymous , working for exit deutschland , an organization that helps people leave the far-right scene .
there is a widespread feeling that the west left the east behind economically .
in the last 20 years , unemployment in the former east has been consistently twice as high as in the west , and the emigration of young eastern germans remains a problem .
statistical evidence shows that german far-right parties tend to prosper in times of economic depression , and the npd has aimed its electoral resources aggressively at the most neglected districts .
the exit deutschland representative , who has counseled numerous former neo-nazis , said that the frustration that comes from being left behind after watching friends leave your home town is a factor common to many of those who turn to right-wing extremism .
" those who stay , for whatever reason - because they ca n't find a job anywhere else , for example - feel an enormous frustration .
that is fertile ground for far-right groups - and for extremist groups in general , " he said .
sympathy for the left this growing eastern german sympathy with the far-right chimed in with a study completed in 2003 , which found that 16 percent of germans had an extreme right-wing world-view - that is , they expressed chauvinistic , anti-semitic , social-darwinist or xenophobic opinions , and tended to trivialize the nazi regime .
in the east , this world-view was found in 23 percent of the population , compared to 14 percent in the west .
this showed a marked change from the early 1990s , when a similar study found far-right-wing opinion more prevalent in the west .
statisticians have linked this switch to a decline in economic expectation .
whereas easterners were more optimistic about their economic prospects in the early 1990s , by the late 1990s , westerners had become more positive about the economy .
behind this turnaround lay a real sense of betrayal .
in a study written in 2005 , political scientist richard stoess wrote , " that the eastern german people overtook their western compatriots in sympathy for right-wing extremism lay in the fact that their initial trust in the western system of democracy and market economy had turned into particularly bitter disappointment . "
neo-nazis for the new century as state authority began to re-assert itself in the east , the far-right developed more subtle ways to organize .
" the structures have become smaller , " said borstel .
" they no longer rely on large parties like the npd , but rather local cells , which are more difficult for the state to break up .
they have become anchored in local communities in a way i thought would never happen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far-right has reinvented itself for the new century this assimilation was mirrored in the far-right political parties , which have spent the past decade making themselves electable in the east .
although the npd have steadily lost ground in the former west , in the east they have gained a foothold in several state parliaments .
" the big bang was the state election of 2004 in saxony , where the npd first gained representation in an eastern german state parliament , " said sundermeyer .
" since then it has very gradually established itself as a ' normal ' party . "
the npd was re-elected to the saxony parliament in 2009 , with 5.6 percent of the vote .
the npd 's membership figures had risen from 4,000 in 1995 to 6,800 in 2009 .
the npd has achieved this success by aiming its messages at young people , especially via the internet , and appealing to sentiments shared by the far-left - anti-americanism , anti-israel , anti-globalization .
it has worked to pick up the youth protest vote , targeting sub-cultures with an anti-system stance . author : ben knight editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 21.09.2010 the rise of the far-right in the east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis gained ground in the east after the fall of the wall along with many other prejudices , eastern germany has had to contend with a reputation for neo-nazism .
it 's not entirely unjustified , but right-wing extremism in the east has roots in economic hardship . right-wing violence was most dramatic in the first years of the newly unified germany - and more and more often , they occurred in the former east germany .
for three consecutive nights in august 1992 , several hundred neo-nazis - watched by up to 2,000 locals - attacked an apartment block for asylum seekers in the north-eastern town of rostock .
with the police unprepared and initially outnumbered , the violence continued unchecked until it culminated in an arson attack .
the rostock riots quickly achieved international notoriety .
pictures of drunken , violent east germans doing hitler salutes were printed around the world .
this was not the dawn of a new , hopeful country that had been celebrated less than two years before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1992 arson attack on an asylum shelter in rostock became infamous authority vacuum neo-nazi violence was not just a stain on the former east germany .
over 100 of the 370 rioters arrested in rostock had travelled from the former west , where there was a string of horrific attacks on turkish immigrants in the early nineties .
but rostock cemented the reputation of post-wall eastern germany as a new haven for neo-nazism , and that reputation stuck .
what characterized the rostock riots as specifically east german was the powerlessness of the authorities . for two or three years after the fall of the wall , state institutions in the former german democratic republic were weakened by the period of transition .
police officers suddenly found themselves associated with a discredited regime .
dierk borstel , a researcher into right-wing extremism at the university of bielefeld , described the precarious circumstances in the early 1990s as linked to a lack of functioning insitutions .
" the police force was destabilized and the church had little influence anyway , " borstel told deutsche welle .
" the eastern german trade unions and the pds , the successor party to the former ruling communist sed , had little authority , and the trade unions and industry associations coming in from the west were all very weak in the east . "
worst of many worlds these semi-anarchic conditions were fertile ground for far-right activists in the former east germany , and their cause was further helped by the disappointment and poverty that spread in the east after reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd has scored some electoral success in the last six years " the expectation of east germans after reunification was : ' we 're going to get the security of the east plus the freedoms of the west , " ' borstel says .
" the result was that they lost the securities and could n't afford the freedoms . "
even though the skinhead neo-nazi scene originated in western europe , it already existed in east germany before the fall of the iron curtain .
it was often linked to certain football teams , and occasionally broke out in extreme violence , such as the attack of 30 skinheads on a concert in a church in central east berlin in 1987 .
the far-right movement in the east capitalized on what many describe as the gdr 's denial of its own nazi history .
olaf sundermeyer , author of " in the npd , " a book about the development of germany 's populist far-right national democratic party , believes the gdr 's distanced attitude to hitler 's germany helped feed the neo-nazi movement .
" communist leaders in the gdr said , ' we are an anti-fascist state and we have no responsibility for history .
there are no nazis here . '
of course that was n't true .
there were former nazis in both east and west germany , but there was no denazification in east germany - the nazi history was not dealt with , " he said .
imbalance and injustice east german society was never particularly multicultural , and the government 's immigration policies showed a determination to keep the population monotone .
immigrant workers from other socialist countries like mozambique were sent home if they got pregnant , or as soon as their allotted time ran out .
the lack of a multicultural foundation is still reflected in eastern german society today .
" eastern germany has a lot fewer immigrants - and it has long been acknowledged that where there are no immigrants and no jews , there is more racism and anti-semitism , " borstel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has caused unrest in the former gdr neo-nazis were also able to win over some east germans with familiar ideas .
" national socialism often starts out with the idea of socialism , and then that is combined with frustration , unemployment , lack of opportunity , and populations moving away . "
this is the opinion of a former neo-nazi who wants to remain anonymous , working for exit deutschland , an organization that helps people leave the far-right scene .
there is a widespread feeling that the west left the east behind economically .
in the last 20 years , unemployment in the former east has been consistently twice as high as in the west , and the emigration of young eastern germans remains a problem .
statistical evidence shows that german far-right parties tend to prosper in times of economic depression , and the npd has aimed its electoral resources aggressively at the most neglected districts .
the exit deutschland representative , who has counseled numerous former neo-nazis , said that the frustration that comes from being left behind after watching friends leave your home town is a factor common to many of those who turn to right-wing extremism .
" those who stay , for whatever reason - because they ca n't find a job anywhere else , for example - feel an enormous frustration .
that is fertile ground for far-right groups - and for extremist groups in general , " he said .
sympathy for the left this growing eastern german sympathy with the far-right chimed in with a study completed in 2003 , which found that 16 percent of germans had an extreme right-wing world-view - that is , they expressed chauvinistic , anti-semitic , social-darwinist or xenophobic opinions , and tended to trivialize the nazi regime .
in the east , this world-view was found in 23 percent of the population , compared to 14 percent in the west .
this showed a marked change from the early 1990s , when a similar study found far-right-wing opinion more prevalent in the west .
statisticians have linked this switch to a decline in economic expectation .
whereas easterners were more optimistic about their economic prospects in the early 1990s , by the late 1990s , westerners had become more positive about the economy .
behind this turnaround lay a real sense of betrayal .
in a study written in 2005 , political scientist richard stoess wrote , " that the eastern german people overtook their western compatriots in sympathy for right-wing extremism lay in the fact that their initial trust in the western system of democracy and market economy had turned into particularly bitter disappointment . "

the interior minister made the announcement on monday at a summit in berlin . the german interior minister thomas de maiziere has asked internet companies to devise a self-regulatory code to protect web users . he made the announcement on monday following a summit of politicians , privacy experts and industry representatives in berlin .
the debate about google street view - an online service allowing users to view panoramic images at street level - has led the interior minister to call for the proposed data protection code .
the guidelines will force companies to work out how to protect data which could compromise the privacy of individuals .
at the summit hosted by de maiziere , experts discussed the general issue of geographic image data available online .
many germans are hostile to the idea of personal information and photographic images of homes being available for everyone to access .
the debate is tinged with memories of the east german secret police and the nazi gestapo .
the proposed code may make a law on the issue redundant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german interior minister hosted the one-day summit in berlin however , de maiziere recognized that such technology can be beneficial , and said he does not want to give people the right to delete images that can be viewed by the public anyway .
he does , however , want service providers to make it clearer how their privacy rights may be infringed by using particular services .
de maiziere suggested that such self-regulation of the internet industry could " at least in part make legal provision unnecessary . "
however , the interior minister wants to lay down a law to draw a " red line , " " which can not be crossed under any circumstances . "
this will be designed to stop particularly extreme violations of privacy .
if the internet companies can not decide on a code by december , de maiziere said the government would immediately intervene in the matter .
the german consumer protection minister ilse aigner welcomed the move as " a good basis , which we can build upon , and which will allow us to take into account the interests of the users . "
she demanded a balance between new technological advances , which can benefit consumers , and the protection of the privacy of individuals .
the head of internet giant google in europe , philipp schindler , also greeted the suggestion with enthusiasm and agreed his company would work with others to draw up the code .
" geo-data from the internet is becoming more important for citizens , authorities and companies , a trend which will grow further with the rise of mobile internet use , " schindler added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 21.09.2010 the rise of the far-right in the east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis gained ground in the east after the fall of the wall along with many other prejudices , eastern germany has had to contend with a reputation for neo-nazism .
it 's not entirely unjustified , but right-wing extremism in the east has roots in economic hardship . right-wing violence was most dramatic in the first years of the newly unified germany - and more and more often , they occurred in the former east germany .
for three consecutive nights in august 1992 , several hundred neo-nazis - watched by up to 2,000 locals - attacked an apartment block for asylum seekers in the north-eastern town of rostock .
with the police unprepared and initially outnumbered , the violence continued unchecked until it culminated in an arson attack .
the rostock riots quickly achieved international notoriety .
pictures of drunken , violent east germans doing hitler salutes were printed around the world .
this was not the dawn of a new , hopeful country that had been celebrated less than two years before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1992 arson attack on an asylum shelter in rostock became infamous authority vacuum neo-nazi violence was not just a stain on the former east germany .
over 100 of the 370 rioters arrested in rostock had travelled from the former west , where there was a string of horrific attacks on turkish immigrants in the early nineties .
but rostock cemented the reputation of post-wall eastern germany as a new haven for neo-nazism , and that reputation stuck .
what characterized the rostock riots as specifically east german was the powerlessness of the authorities . for two or three years after the fall of the wall , state institutions in the former german democratic republic were weakened by the period of transition .
police officers suddenly found themselves associated with a discredited regime .
dierk borstel , a researcher into right-wing extremism at the university of bielefeld , described the precarious circumstances in the early 1990s as linked to a lack of functioning insitutions .
" the police force was destabilized and the church had little influence anyway , " borstel told deutsche welle .
" the eastern german trade unions and the pds , the successor party to the former ruling communist sed , had little authority , and the trade unions and industry associations coming in from the west were all very weak in the east . "
worst of many worlds these semi-anarchic conditions were fertile ground for far-right activists in the former east germany , and their cause was further helped by the disappointment and poverty that spread in the east after reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd has scored some electoral success in the last six years " the expectation of east germans after reunification was : ' we 're going to get the security of the east plus the freedoms of the west , " ' borstel says .
" the result was that they lost the securities and could n't afford the freedoms . "
even though the skinhead neo-nazi scene originated in western europe , it already existed in east germany before the fall of the iron curtain .
it was often linked to certain football teams , and occasionally broke out in extreme violence , such as the attack of 30 skinheads on a concert in a church in central east berlin in 1987 .
the far-right movement in the east capitalized on what many describe as the gdr 's denial of its own nazi history .
olaf sundermeyer , author of " in the npd , " a book about the development of germany 's populist far-right national democratic party , believes the gdr 's distanced attitude to hitler 's germany helped feed the neo-nazi movement .
" communist leaders in the gdr said , ' we are an anti-fascist state and we have no responsibility for history .
there are no nazis here . '
of course that was n't true .
there were former nazis in both east and west germany , but there was no denazification in east germany - the nazi history was not dealt with , " he said .
imbalance and injustice east german society was never particularly multicultural , and the government 's immigration policies showed a determination to keep the population monotone .
immigrant workers from other socialist countries like mozambique were sent home if they got pregnant , or as soon as their allotted time ran out .
the lack of a multicultural foundation is still reflected in eastern german society today .
" eastern germany has a lot fewer immigrants - and it has long been acknowledged that where there are no immigrants and no jews , there is more racism and anti-semitism , " borstel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has caused unrest in the former gdr neo-nazis were also able to win over some east germans with familiar ideas .
" national socialism often starts out with the idea of socialism , and then that is combined with frustration , unemployment , lack of opportunity , and populations moving away . "
this is the opinion of a former neo-nazi who wants to remain anonymous , working for exit deutschland , an organization that helps people leave the far-right scene .
there is a widespread feeling that the west left the east behind economically .
in the last 20 years , unemployment in the former east has been consistently twice as high as in the west , and the emigration of young eastern germans remains a problem .
statistical evidence shows that german far-right parties tend to prosper in times of economic depression , and the npd has aimed its electoral resources aggressively at the most neglected districts .
the exit deutschland representative , who has counseled numerous former neo-nazis , said that the frustration that comes from being left behind after watching friends leave your home town is a factor common to many of those who turn to right-wing extremism .
" those who stay , for whatever reason - because they ca n't find a job anywhere else , for example - feel an enormous frustration .
that is fertile ground for far-right groups - and for extremist groups in general , " he said .
sympathy for the left this growing eastern german sympathy with the far-right chimed in with a study completed in 2003 , which found that 16 percent of germans had an extreme right-wing world-view - that is , they expressed chauvinistic , anti-semitic , social-darwinist or xenophobic opinions , and tended to trivialize the nazi regime .
in the east , this world-view was found in 23 percent of the population , compared to 14 percent in the west .
this showed a marked change from the early 1990s , when a similar study found far-right-wing opinion more prevalent in the west .
statisticians have linked this switch to a decline in economic expectation .
whereas easterners were more optimistic about their economic prospects in the early 1990s , by the late 1990s , westerners had become more positive about the economy .
behind this turnaround lay a real sense of betrayal .
in a study written in 2005 , political scientist richard stoess wrote , " that the eastern german people overtook their western compatriots in sympathy for right-wing extremism lay in the fact that their initial trust in the western system of democracy and market economy had turned into particularly bitter disappointment . "
neo-nazis for the new century as state authority began to re-assert itself in the east , the far-right developed more subtle ways to organize .
" the structures have become smaller , " said borstel .
" they no longer rely on large parties like the npd , but rather local cells , which are more difficult for the state to break up .
they have become anchored in local communities in a way i thought would never happen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far-right has reinvented itself for the new century this assimilation was mirrored in the far-right political parties , which have spent the past decade making themselves electable in the east .
although the npd have steadily lost ground in the former west , in the east they have gained a foothold in several state parliaments .
" the big bang was the state election of 2004 in saxony , where the npd first gained representation in an eastern german state parliament , " said sundermeyer .
" since then it has very gradually established itself as a ' normal ' party . "
the npd was re-elected to the saxony parliament in 2009 , with 5.6 percent of the vote .
the npd 's membership figures had risen from 4,000 in 1995 to 6,800 in 2009 .
the npd has achieved this success by aiming its messages at young people , especially via the internet , and appealing to sentiments shared by the far-left - anti-americanism , anti-israel , anti-globalization .
it has worked to pick up the youth protest vote , targeting sub-cultures with an anti-system stance . author : ben knight editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bid will be paid for by a 10.2 billion euro capital increase . investors in postbank will be able to sell their shares to deutsche bank at 25 euros a piece from wednesday .
germany 's financial regulator bafin on tuesday set the price based on a three month average .
deutsche bank already owns 29.95 percent of postbank and is looking to take control of the bank , which has the largest retail network in the country .
tuesday 's announcement applies to the roughly 30 percent of shares owned by various private and institutional investors , known as free float .
those investors have until october 5 to sell their shares .
biggest ever cash call deutsche bank will finance its bid via a capital increase worth 10.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4bn -rrb- .
on monday , the bank announced it would issue 308.6 million new shares at 33 euros a piece .
investors will be able to buy one new share for every two they already own in what is deutsche bank 's biggest ever cash call to investors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche post still owns 39.5 percent of postbank the remaining 39.5 percent stake in postbank belongs to deutsche post .
in september 2008 , deutsche post agreed to sell that stake to deutsche bank for 45 euros per share by 2013 .
at the time , postbank 's value was higher and deutsche bank will have to honor that price .
deutsche bank is keen to boost its customer base in germany .
taking over postbank means the combined bank will have 24 million retail clients , more than any other bank in germany .
at present , deutsche bank 's focus is on investment banking .
equity boost the takeover will also help boost deutsche 's capital base .
new global banking rules , known as the basel iii accord , require banks to hold more capital .
the agreement stipulates that banks will have to hold common equity equivalent to at least seven percent of their assets by 2019 .
that is more than triple the two percent required at the moment and is meant to shield banks from another financial crisis by acting as a cushion for potential losses .

the message is that talking helps . in response to cases of child abuse within the jesuit order in germany earlier this year , the government in march established the post of an independent commissioner and also set up a telephone hotline for victims to speak about their suffering and seek help .
since then , about 2,500 germans have made contact with her office , said commissioner christine bergmann , adding " some 60 percent of them have never previously talked about what happened to them " .
on average , the victims were now " in their 50s " , she said , with the abuse having taken place " mostly some 20 , or sometimes even 40 or 50 years ago . "
clerical culprits almost 50 percent of sex abuse cases reported took place in german institutions , primarily in the roman catholic church , as well as on a lesser scale in sports clubs and at schools .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at berlin 's canisius college , run by jesuits , first cases of abuse were reported in january 2010 some 34 percent of the callers claimed to have been abused within their own families or by acquaintances .
" while the perpetrators were more than 80 percent male , it was surprising to see that almost as many men as women were victims of sexual abuse " , said joerg fegert , director of the ulm university clinic , who heads the team analysing the calls .
clear message fegert said the figures his team compiled with the prior consent of the victims were " far from representative for the entire german population " .
nevertheless the message the victims wanted to send to the general public was " very clear " .
" they believe it 's important to have someone who finally listens to them and believes what they say , " he said .
" compensation is also an issue because it would mean that the victims ' suffering is officially acknowledged . "
a key demand for politics was to make sure that a statute of limitations on sexual abuse was completely abolished , fegert said , because victims ' suffering did n't end after a certain time limit .
raising public awareness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a telephone hotline has been set up for victims independent commissioner christine bergmann on tuesday also launched a public campaign aimed at ending " decades of ignorance about the issue of sexual abuse in germany " .
a special internet website , as well as newspaper and television advertisements , are intended to publicise the abuse telephone hotline , so that many more victims can " break out of their isolation " .
german filmmaker wim wenders produced a special tv spot entitled : " breaking the silence breaks the power of the perpetrator " .
" ignoring bad things has a long tradition in germany " , wenders said , " but this ignorance perpetuates the trauma and must be ended to prevent cases of sexual abuse from happening again . "
experts ' roundtable round-table talks organized by the german government are scheduled to be held in november to discuss legal issues concerning sexual abuse , as well as medical and financial aid for the victims .

merkel said that more conditions should be attached to aid to ensure effective results . chancellor angela merkel has called for the governments of developing nations to take more responsibility in fighting poverty .
the chancellor also said that developed nations should attach tighter conditions to the money they lend and argued in favor of linking the amount to results already achieved .
she said that countries should not rely indefinitely on handouts and had to take charge of their own development . she added social progress was " unthinkable " without good governance and human rights .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the summit has brought together some 140 world leaders " there is one thing we have to accept , " said merkel .
" the primary responsibility for development lies with the governments of the developing countries .
it is in their hands whether aid can be effective .
therefore , support for good governance is as important as aid itself . "
merkel made her comments at the un general assembly 's special session on the millennium development goals -lrb- mdgs -rrb- in new york on tuesday , an event attended by some 140 heads of state or government .
they are reviewing the progress of the mdgs agreed 10 years ago to cut poverty , and improve gender quality , health and education .
aid should be used more effectively firm conditions to ensure that money was spent in an effective way should be applied , according to the chancellor .
" development aid can not continue indefinitely .
the task is to use limited resources as effectively as possible . "
" we have to put results-based development aid at center stage , " merkel said .
" it should just only be about money but also about what comes of that money . "
the chancellor added lasting progress on development would require the world to successfully address challenges in four fields - peace and security , poverty reduction , environmental protection and promotion of human rights and good governance .
germany is the third biggest contributor to the un budget and it is one of the largest development aid donors .
potential for german seat on the security council the chancellor is keen for germany to become a non-permanent member of the influential un security council .
she claimed on tuesday that she had received " a lot of support and encouragment " for germany 's bid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is hoping germany will get a seat on the un security council a seat on the un 's peacekeeping council would allow germany to " present its views more strongly . "
the new non-permanent members will be elected by the general assemby in october .
however , the aid organization oxfam expressed disappointment in merkel 's speech .
" we expected much more from the german contribution , " oxfam spokeswoman emma seery commented after the speech .
" germany did not say how it will keep its promises to help poorer countries . "
helping women help themselves many experts are concerned that a number of the mdgs on poverty are unlikely to be achieved by the 2015 deadline .
several speakers at the meeting said the goals would not be achieved unless more is done to improve the lives of poor women .
liberian president ellen johnson-sirleaf , africa 's first female head of state , called for more investment in sectors that help women , including agriculture and small businesses .
" as we renew our resolve in the year 2010 , we must recognize the need for inclusive economic growth , " she said .
the president of the european commission , jose manuel barroso , announced that 1 billion euros -lrb- 1.3 billion dollars -rrb- would be given to help africa , the caribbean and pacific countries lagging behind their mdgs .
barroso urged other donors not to use the economic crisis as an excuse to shirk their responsibilities to the poor .
" the international community still has a long way to go before the millennium goals are reached , " he said .

however , he said , rules must be strictly observed . european central bank president jean-claude trichet has hailed the efforts of estonia in edging closer to joining the eurozone .
trichet said on monday that the fact that the baltic state had qualified showed that the currency bloc still had room to expand , despite recent concerns over the integrity of the currency .
estonia is due to become the eurozone 's 17th member on january 1 .
trichet said this showed that " that the euro area is not a ' closed shop ' but is open to those countries and economies that are fully compliant with the entry criteria in a convincing and sustainable manner . "

prices in estonia are already being displayed in euros as well as estonian kroons and there will be a two week period of dual circulation before the kroon ceases to become legal tender .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 21.09.2010 the rise of the far-right in the east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis gained ground in the east after the fall of the wall along with many other prejudices , eastern germany has had to contend with a reputation for neo-nazism .
it 's not entirely unjustified , but right-wing extremism in the east has roots in economic hardship . right-wing violence was most dramatic in the first years of the newly unified germany - and more and more often , they occurred in the former east germany .
for three consecutive nights in august 1992 , several hundred neo-nazis - watched by up to 2,000 locals - attacked an apartment block for asylum seekers in the north-eastern town of rostock .
with the police unprepared and initially outnumbered , the violence continued unchecked until it culminated in an arson attack .
the rostock riots quickly achieved international notoriety .
pictures of drunken , violent east germans doing hitler salutes were printed around the world .
this was not the dawn of a new , hopeful country that had been celebrated less than two years before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1992 arson attack on an asylum shelter in rostock became infamous authority vacuum neo-nazi violence was not just a stain on the former east germany .
over 100 of the 370 rioters arrested in rostock had travelled from the former west , where there was a string of horrific attacks on turkish immigrants in the early nineties .
but rostock cemented the reputation of post-wall eastern germany as a new haven for neo-nazism , and that reputation stuck .
what characterized the rostock riots as specifically east german was the powerlessness of the authorities . for two or three years after the fall of the wall , state institutions in the former german democratic republic were weakened by the period of transition .
police officers suddenly found themselves associated with a discredited regime .
dierk borstel , a researcher into right-wing extremism at the university of bielefeld , described the precarious circumstances in the early 1990s as linked to a lack of functioning insitutions .
" the police force was destabilized and the church had little influence anyway , " borstel told deutsche welle .
" the eastern german trade unions and the pds , the successor party to the former ruling communist sed , had little authority , and the trade unions and industry associations coming in from the west were all very weak in the east . "
worst of many worlds these semi-anarchic conditions were fertile ground for far-right activists in the former east germany , and their cause was further helped by the disappointment and poverty that spread in the east after reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd has scored some electoral success in the last six years " the expectation of east germans after reunification was : ' we 're going to get the security of the east plus the freedoms of the west , " ' borstel says .
" the result was that they lost the securities and could n't afford the freedoms . "
even though the skinhead neo-nazi scene originated in western europe , it already existed in east germany before the fall of the iron curtain .
it was often linked to certain football teams , and occasionally broke out in extreme violence , such as the attack of 30 skinheads on a concert in a church in central east berlin in 1987 .
the far-right movement in the east capitalized on what many describe as the gdr 's denial of its own nazi history .
olaf sundermeyer , author of " in the npd , " a book about the development of germany 's populist far-right national democratic party , believes the gdr 's distanced attitude to hitler 's germany helped feed the neo-nazi movement .
" communist leaders in the gdr said , ' we are an anti-fascist state and we have no responsibility for history .
there are no nazis here . '
of course that was n't true .
there were former nazis in both east and west germany , but there was no denazification in east germany - the nazi history was not dealt with , " he said .
imbalance and injustice east german society was never particularly multicultural , and the government 's immigration policies showed a determination to keep the population monotone .
immigrant workers from other socialist countries like mozambique were sent home if they got pregnant , or as soon as their allotted time ran out .
the lack of a multicultural foundation is still reflected in eastern german society today .
" eastern germany has a lot fewer immigrants - and it has long been acknowledged that where there are no immigrants and no jews , there is more racism and anti-semitism , " borstel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has caused unrest in the former gdr neo-nazis were also able to win over some east germans with familiar ideas .
" national socialism often starts out with the idea of socialism , and then that is combined with frustration , unemployment , lack of opportunity , and populations moving away . "
this is the opinion of a former neo-nazi who wants to remain anonymous , working for exit deutschland , an organization that helps people leave the far-right scene .
there is a widespread feeling that the west left the east behind economically .
in the last 20 years , unemployment in the former east has been consistently twice as high as in the west , and the emigration of young eastern germans remains a problem .
statistical evidence shows that german far-right parties tend to prosper in times of economic depression , and the npd has aimed its electoral resources aggressively at the most neglected districts .
the exit deutschland representative , who has counseled numerous former neo-nazis , said that the frustration that comes from being left behind after watching friends leave your home town is a factor common to many of those who turn to right-wing extremism .
" those who stay , for whatever reason - because they ca n't find a job anywhere else , for example - feel an enormous frustration .
that is fertile ground for far-right groups - and for extremist groups in general , " he said .
sympathy for the left this growing eastern german sympathy with the far-right chimed in with a study completed in 2003 , which found that 16 percent of germans had an extreme right-wing world-view - that is , they expressed chauvinistic , anti-semitic , social-darwinist or xenophobic opinions , and tended to trivialize the nazi regime .
in the east , this world-view was found in 23 percent of the population , compared to 14 percent in the west .
this showed a marked change from the early 1990s , when a similar study found far-right-wing opinion more prevalent in the west .
statisticians have linked this switch to a decline in economic expectation .
whereas easterners were more optimistic about their economic prospects in the early 1990s , by the late 1990s , westerners had become more positive about the economy .
behind this turnaround lay a real sense of betrayal .
in a study written in 2005 , political scientist richard stoess wrote , " that the eastern german people overtook their western compatriots in sympathy for right-wing extremism lay in the fact that their initial trust in the western system of democracy and market economy had turned into particularly bitter disappointment . "
neo-nazis for the new century as state authority began to re-assert itself in the east , the far-right developed more subtle ways to organize .
" the structures have become smaller , " said borstel .
" they no longer rely on large parties like the npd , but rather local cells , which are more difficult for the state to break up .
they have become anchored in local communities in a way i thought would never happen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far-right has reinvented itself for the new century this assimilation was mirrored in the far-right political parties , which have spent the past decade making themselves electable in the east .
although the npd have steadily lost ground in the former west , in the east they have gained a foothold in several state parliaments .
" the big bang was the state election of 2004 in saxony , where the npd first gained representation in an eastern german state parliament , " said sundermeyer .
" since then it has very gradually established itself as a ' normal ' party . "
the npd was re-elected to the saxony parliament in 2009 , with 5.6 percent of the vote .
the npd 's membership figures had risen from 4,000 in 1995 to 6,800 in 2009 .
the npd has achieved this success by aiming its messages at young people , especially via the internet , and appealing to sentiments shared by the far-left - anti-americanism , anti-israel , anti-globalization .
it has worked to pick up the youth protest vote , targeting sub-cultures with an anti-system stance . author : ben knight editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 21.09.2010 the rise of the far-right in the east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis gained ground in the east after the fall of the wall along with many other prejudices , eastern germany has had to contend with a reputation for neo-nazism .
it 's not entirely unjustified , but right-wing extremism in the east has roots in economic hardship . right-wing violence was most dramatic in the first years of the newly unified germany - and more and more often , they occurred in the former east germany .
for three consecutive nights in august 1992 , several hundred neo-nazis - watched by up to 2,000 locals - attacked an apartment block for asylum seekers in the north-eastern town of rostock .
with the police unprepared and initially outnumbered , the violence continued unchecked until it culminated in an arson attack .
the rostock riots quickly achieved international notoriety .
pictures of drunken , violent east germans doing hitler salutes were printed around the world .
this was not the dawn of a new , hopeful country that had been celebrated less than two years before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1992 arson attack on an asylum shelter in rostock became infamous authority vacuum neo-nazi violence was not just a stain on the former east germany .
over 100 of the 370 rioters arrested in rostock had travelled from the former west , where there was a string of horrific attacks on turkish immigrants in the early nineties .
but rostock cemented the reputation of post-wall eastern germany as a new haven for neo-nazism , and that reputation stuck .
what characterized the rostock riots as specifically east german was the powerlessness of the authorities . for two or three years after the fall of the wall , state institutions in the former german democratic republic were weakened by the period of transition .
police officers suddenly found themselves associated with a discredited regime .
dierk borstel , a researcher into right-wing extremism at the university of bielefeld , described the precarious circumstances in the early 1990s as linked to a lack of functioning insitutions .
" the police force was destabilized and the church had little influence anyway , " borstel told deutsche welle .
" the eastern german trade unions and the pds , the successor party to the former ruling communist sed , had little authority , and the trade unions and industry associations coming in from the west were all very weak in the east . "
worst of many worlds these semi-anarchic conditions were fertile ground for far-right activists in the former east germany , and their cause was further helped by the disappointment and poverty that spread in the east after reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd has scored some electoral success in the last six years " the expectation of east germans after reunification was : ' we 're going to get the security of the east plus the freedoms of the west , " ' borstel says .
" the result was that they lost the securities and could n't afford the freedoms . "
even though the skinhead neo-nazi scene originated in western europe , it already existed in east germany before the fall of the iron curtain .
it was often linked to certain football teams , and occasionally broke out in extreme violence , such as the attack of 30 skinheads on a concert in a church in central east berlin in 1987 .
the far-right movement in the east capitalized on what many describe as the gdr 's denial of its own nazi history .
olaf sundermeyer , author of " in the npd , " a book about the development of germany 's populist far-right national democratic party , believes the gdr 's distanced attitude to hitler 's germany helped feed the neo-nazi movement .
" communist leaders in the gdr said , ' we are an anti-fascist state and we have no responsibility for history .
there are no nazis here . '
of course that was n't true .
there were former nazis in both east and west germany , but there was no denazification in east germany - the nazi history was not dealt with , " he said .
imbalance and injustice east german society was never particularly multicultural , and the government 's immigration policies showed a determination to keep the population monotone .
immigrant workers from other socialist countries like mozambique were sent home if they got pregnant , or as soon as their allotted time ran out .
the lack of a multicultural foundation is still reflected in eastern german society today .
" eastern germany has a lot fewer immigrants - and it has long been acknowledged that where there are no immigrants and no jews , there is more racism and anti-semitism , " borstel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has caused unrest in the former gdr neo-nazis were also able to win over some east germans with familiar ideas .
" national socialism often starts out with the idea of socialism , and then that is combined with frustration , unemployment , lack of opportunity , and populations moving away . "
this is the opinion of a former neo-nazi who wants to remain anonymous , working for exit deutschland , an organization that helps people leave the far-right scene .
there is a widespread feeling that the west left the east behind economically .
in the last 20 years , unemployment in the former east has been consistently twice as high as in the west , and the emigration of young eastern germans remains a problem .
statistical evidence shows that german far-right parties tend to prosper in times of economic depression , and the npd has aimed its electoral resources aggressively at the most neglected districts .
the exit deutschland representative , who has counseled numerous former neo-nazis , said that the frustration that comes from being left behind after watching friends leave your home town is a factor common to many of those who turn to right-wing extremism .
" those who stay , for whatever reason - because they ca n't find a job anywhere else , for example - feel an enormous frustration .
that is fertile ground for far-right groups - and for extremist groups in general , " he said .
sympathy for the left this growing eastern german sympathy with the far-right chimed in with a study completed in 2003 , which found that 16 percent of germans had an extreme right-wing world-view - that is , they expressed chauvinistic , anti-semitic , social-darwinist or xenophobic opinions , and tended to trivialize the nazi regime .
in the east , this world-view was found in 23 percent of the population , compared to 14 percent in the west .
this showed a marked change from the early 1990s , when a similar study found far-right-wing opinion more prevalent in the west .
statisticians have linked this switch to a decline in economic expectation .
whereas easterners were more optimistic about their economic prospects in the early 1990s , by the late 1990s , westerners had become more positive about the economy .
behind this turnaround lay a real sense of betrayal .
in a study written in 2005 , political scientist richard stoess wrote , " that the eastern german people overtook their western compatriots in sympathy for right-wing extremism lay in the fact that their initial trust in the western system of democracy and market economy had turned into particularly bitter disappointment . "
neo-nazis for the new century as state authority began to re-assert itself in the east , the far-right developed more subtle ways to organize .
" the structures have become smaller , " said borstel .
" they no longer rely on large parties like the npd , but rather local cells , which are more difficult for the state to break up .
they have become anchored in local communities in a way i thought would never happen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far-right has reinvented itself for the new century this assimilation was mirrored in the far-right political parties , which have spent the past decade making themselves electable in the east .
although the npd have steadily lost ground in the former west , in the east they have gained a foothold in several state parliaments .
" the big bang was the state election of 2004 in saxony , where the npd first gained representation in an eastern german state parliament , " said sundermeyer .
" since then it has very gradually established itself as a ' normal ' party . "
the npd was re-elected to the saxony parliament in 2009 , with 5.6 percent of the vote .
the npd 's membership figures had risen from 4,000 in 1995 to 6,800 in 2009 .
the npd has achieved this success by aiming its messages at young people , especially via the internet , and appealing to sentiments shared by the far-left - anti-americanism , anti-israel , anti-globalization .
it has worked to pick up the youth protest vote , targeting sub-cultures with an anti-system stance . author : ben knight editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 21.09.2010 the rise of the far-right in the east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis gained ground in the east after the fall of the wall along with many other prejudices , eastern germany has had to contend with a reputation for neo-nazism .
it 's not entirely unjustified , but right-wing extremism in the east has roots in economic hardship . right-wing violence was most dramatic in the first years of the newly unified germany - and more and more often , they occurred in the former east germany .
for three consecutive nights in august 1992 , several hundred neo-nazis - watched by up to 2,000 locals - attacked an apartment block for asylum seekers in the north-eastern town of rostock .
with the police unprepared and initially outnumbered , the violence continued unchecked until it culminated in an arson attack .
the rostock riots quickly achieved international notoriety .
pictures of drunken , violent east germans doing hitler salutes were printed around the world .
this was not the dawn of a new , hopeful country that had been celebrated less than two years before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1992 arson attack on an asylum shelter in rostock became infamous authority vacuum neo-nazi violence was not just a stain on the former east germany .
over 100 of the 370 rioters arrested in rostock had travelled from the former west , where there was a string of horrific attacks on turkish immigrants in the early nineties .
but rostock cemented the reputation of post-wall eastern germany as a new haven for neo-nazism , and that reputation stuck .
what characterized the rostock riots as specifically east german was the powerlessness of the authorities . for two or three years after the fall of the wall , state institutions in the former german democratic republic were weakened by the period of transition .
police officers suddenly found themselves associated with a discredited regime .
dierk borstel , a researcher into right-wing extremism at the university of bielefeld , described the precarious circumstances in the early 1990s as linked to a lack of functioning insitutions .
" the police force was destabilized and the church had little influence anyway , " borstel told deutsche welle .
" the eastern german trade unions and the pds , the successor party to the former ruling communist sed , had little authority , and the trade unions and industry associations coming in from the west were all very weak in the east . "
worst of many worlds these semi-anarchic conditions were fertile ground for far-right activists in the former east germany , and their cause was further helped by the disappointment and poverty that spread in the east after reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd has scored some electoral success in the last six years " the expectation of east germans after reunification was : ' we 're going to get the security of the east plus the freedoms of the west , " ' borstel says .
" the result was that they lost the securities and could n't afford the freedoms . "
even though the skinhead neo-nazi scene originated in western europe , it already existed in east germany before the fall of the iron curtain .
it was often linked to certain football teams , and occasionally broke out in extreme violence , such as the attack of 30 skinheads on a concert in a church in central east berlin in 1987 .
the far-right movement in the east capitalized on what many describe as the gdr 's denial of its own nazi history .
olaf sundermeyer , author of " in the npd , " a book about the development of germany 's populist far-right national democratic party , believes the gdr 's distanced attitude to hitler 's germany helped feed the neo-nazi movement .
" communist leaders in the gdr said , ' we are an anti-fascist state and we have no responsibility for history .
there are no nazis here . '
of course that was n't true .
there were former nazis in both east and west germany , but there was no denazification in east germany - the nazi history was not dealt with , " he said .
imbalance and injustice east german society was never particularly multicultural , and the government 's immigration policies showed a determination to keep the population monotone .
immigrant workers from other socialist countries like mozambique were sent home if they got pregnant , or as soon as their allotted time ran out .
the lack of a multicultural foundation is still reflected in eastern german society today .
" eastern germany has a lot fewer immigrants - and it has long been acknowledged that where there are no immigrants and no jews , there is more racism and anti-semitism , " borstel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has caused unrest in the former gdr neo-nazis were also able to win over some east germans with familiar ideas .
" national socialism often starts out with the idea of socialism , and then that is combined with frustration , unemployment , lack of opportunity , and populations moving away . "
this is the opinion of a former neo-nazi who wants to remain anonymous , working for exit deutschland , an organization that helps people leave the far-right scene .
there is a widespread feeling that the west left the east behind economically .
in the last 20 years , unemployment in the former east has been consistently twice as high as in the west , and the emigration of young eastern germans remains a problem .
statistical evidence shows that german far-right parties tend to prosper in times of economic depression , and the npd has aimed its electoral resources aggressively at the most neglected districts .
the exit deutschland representative , who has counseled numerous former neo-nazis , said that the frustration that comes from being left behind after watching friends leave your home town is a factor common to many of those who turn to right-wing extremism .
" those who stay , for whatever reason - because they ca n't find a job anywhere else , for example - feel an enormous frustration .
that is fertile ground for far-right groups - and for extremist groups in general , " he said .
sympathy for the left this growing eastern german sympathy with the far-right chimed in with a study completed in 2003 , which found that 16 percent of germans had an extreme right-wing world-view - that is , they expressed chauvinistic , anti-semitic , social-darwinist or xenophobic opinions , and tended to trivialize the nazi regime .
in the east , this world-view was found in 23 percent of the population , compared to 14 percent in the west .
this showed a marked change from the early 1990s , when a similar study found far-right-wing opinion more prevalent in the west .
statisticians have linked this switch to a decline in economic expectation .
whereas easterners were more optimistic about their economic prospects in the early 1990s , by the late 1990s , westerners had become more positive about the economy .
behind this turnaround lay a real sense of betrayal .
in a study written in 2005 , political scientist richard stoess wrote , " that the eastern german people overtook their western compatriots in sympathy for right-wing extremism lay in the fact that their initial trust in the western system of democracy and market economy had turned into particularly bitter disappointment . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 21.09.2010 the rise of the far-right in the east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis gained ground in the east after the fall of the wall along with many other prejudices , eastern germany has had to contend with a reputation for neo-nazism .
it 's not entirely unjustified , but right-wing extremism in the east has roots in economic hardship . right-wing violence was most dramatic in the first years of the newly unified germany - and more and more often , they occurred in the former east germany .
for three consecutive nights in august 1992 , several hundred neo-nazis - watched by up to 2,000 locals - attacked an apartment block for asylum seekers in the north-eastern town of rostock .
with the police unprepared and initially outnumbered , the violence continued unchecked until it culminated in an arson attack .
the rostock riots quickly achieved international notoriety .
pictures of drunken , violent east germans doing hitler salutes were printed around the world .
this was not the dawn of a new , hopeful country that had been celebrated less than two years before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1992 arson attack on an asylum shelter in rostock became infamous authority vacuum neo-nazi violence was not just a stain on the former east germany .
over 100 of the 370 rioters arrested in rostock had travelled from the former west , where there was a string of horrific attacks on turkish immigrants in the early nineties .
but rostock cemented the reputation of post-wall eastern germany as a new haven for neo-nazism , and that reputation stuck .
what characterized the rostock riots as specifically east german was the powerlessness of the authorities . for two or three years after the fall of the wall , state institutions in the former german democratic republic were weakened by the period of transition .
police officers suddenly found themselves associated with a discredited regime .
dierk borstel , a researcher into right-wing extremism at the university of bielefeld , described the precarious circumstances in the early 1990s as linked to a lack of functioning insitutions .
" the police force was destabilized and the church had little influence anyway , " borstel told deutsche welle .
" the eastern german trade unions and the pds , the successor party to the former ruling communist sed , had little authority , and the trade unions and industry associations coming in from the west were all very weak in the east . "
worst of many worlds these semi-anarchic conditions were fertile ground for far-right activists in the former east germany , and their cause was further helped by the disappointment and poverty that spread in the east after reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd has scored some electoral success in the last six years " the expectation of east germans after reunification was : ' we 're going to get the security of the east plus the freedoms of the west , " ' borstel says .
" the result was that they lost the securities and could n't afford the freedoms . "
even though the skinhead neo-nazi scene originated in western europe , it already existed in east germany before the fall of the iron curtain .
it was often linked to certain football teams , and occasionally broke out in extreme violence , such as the attack of 30 skinheads on a concert in a church in central east berlin in 1987 .
the far-right movement in the east capitalized on what many describe as the gdr 's denial of its own nazi history .
olaf sundermeyer , author of " in the npd , " a book about the development of germany 's populist far-right national democratic party , believes the gdr 's distanced attitude to hitler 's germany helped feed the neo-nazi movement .
" communist leaders in the gdr said , ' we are an anti-fascist state and we have no responsibility for history .
there are no nazis here . '
of course that was n't true .
there were former nazis in both east and west germany , but there was no denazification in east germany - the nazi history was not dealt with , " he said .
imbalance and injustice east german society was never particularly multicultural , and the government 's immigration policies showed a determination to keep the population monotone .
immigrant workers from other socialist countries like mozambique were sent home if they got pregnant , or as soon as their allotted time ran out .
the lack of a multicultural foundation is still reflected in eastern german society today .
" eastern germany has a lot fewer immigrants - and it has long been acknowledged that where there are no immigrants and no jews , there is more racism and anti-semitism , " borstel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has caused unrest in the former gdr neo-nazis were also able to win over some east germans with familiar ideas .
" national socialism often starts out with the idea of socialism , and then that is combined with frustration , unemployment , lack of opportunity , and populations moving away . "
this is the opinion of a former neo-nazi who wants to remain anonymous , working for exit deutschland , an organization that helps people leave the far-right scene .
there is a widespread feeling that the west left the east behind economically .
in the last 20 years , unemployment in the former east has been consistently twice as high as in the west , and the emigration of young eastern germans remains a problem .
statistical evidence shows that german far-right parties tend to prosper in times of economic depression , and the npd has aimed its electoral resources aggressively at the most neglected districts .
the exit deutschland representative , who has counseled numerous former neo-nazis , said that the frustration that comes from being left behind after watching friends leave your home town is a factor common to many of those who turn to right-wing extremism .
" those who stay , for whatever reason - because they ca n't find a job anywhere else , for example - feel an enormous frustration .
that is fertile ground for far-right groups - and for extremist groups in general , " he said .
sympathy for the left this growing eastern german sympathy with the far-right chimed in with a study completed in 2003 , which found that 16 percent of germans had an extreme right-wing world-view - that is , they expressed chauvinistic , anti-semitic , social-darwinist or xenophobic opinions , and tended to trivialize the nazi regime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern germany -pipe- 21.09.2010 the rise of the far-right in the east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazis gained ground in the east after the fall of the wall along with many other prejudices , eastern germany has had to contend with a reputation for neo-nazism .
it 's not entirely unjustified , but right-wing extremism in the east has roots in economic hardship . right-wing violence was most dramatic in the first years of the newly unified germany - and more and more often , they occurred in the former east germany .
for three consecutive nights in august 1992 , several hundred neo-nazis - watched by up to 2,000 locals - attacked an apartment block for asylum seekers in the north-eastern town of rostock .
with the police unprepared and initially outnumbered , the violence continued unchecked until it culminated in an arson attack .
the rostock riots quickly achieved international notoriety .
pictures of drunken , violent east germans doing hitler salutes were printed around the world .
this was not the dawn of a new , hopeful country that had been celebrated less than two years before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1992 arson attack on an asylum shelter in rostock became infamous authority vacuum neo-nazi violence was not just a stain on the former east germany .
over 100 of the 370 rioters arrested in rostock had travelled from the former west , where there was a string of horrific attacks on turkish immigrants in the early nineties .
but rostock cemented the reputation of post-wall eastern germany as a new haven for neo-nazism , and that reputation stuck .
what characterized the rostock riots as specifically east german was the powerlessness of the authorities . for two or three years after the fall of the wall , state institutions in the former german democratic republic were weakened by the period of transition .
police officers suddenly found themselves associated with a discredited regime .
dierk borstel , a researcher into right-wing extremism at the university of bielefeld , described the precarious circumstances in the early 1990s as linked to a lack of functioning insitutions .
" the police force was destabilized and the church had little influence anyway , " borstel told deutsche welle .
" the eastern german trade unions and the pds , the successor party to the former ruling communist sed , had little authority , and the trade unions and industry associations coming in from the west were all very weak in the east . "
worst of many worlds these semi-anarchic conditions were fertile ground for far-right activists in the former east germany , and their cause was further helped by the disappointment and poverty that spread in the east after reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd has scored some electoral success in the last six years " the expectation of east germans after reunification was : ' we 're going to get the security of the east plus the freedoms of the west , " ' borstel says .
" the result was that they lost the securities and could n't afford the freedoms . "
even though the skinhead neo-nazi scene originated in western europe , it already existed in east germany before the fall of the iron curtain .
it was often linked to certain football teams , and occasionally broke out in extreme violence , such as the attack of 30 skinheads on a concert in a church in central east berlin in 1987 .
the far-right movement in the east capitalized on what many describe as the gdr 's denial of its own nazi history .
olaf sundermeyer , author of " in the npd , " a book about the development of germany 's populist far-right national democratic party , believes the gdr 's distanced attitude to hitler 's germany helped feed the neo-nazi movement .
" communist leaders in the gdr said , ' we are an anti-fascist state and we have no responsibility for history .
there are no nazis here . '
of course that was n't true .
there were former nazis in both east and west germany , but there was no denazification in east germany - the nazi history was not dealt with , " he said .
imbalance and injustice east german society was never particularly multicultural , and the government 's immigration policies showed a determination to keep the population monotone .
immigrant workers from other socialist countries like mozambique were sent home if they got pregnant , or as soon as their allotted time ran out .
the lack of a multicultural foundation is still reflected in eastern german society today .
" eastern germany has a lot fewer immigrants - and it has long been acknowledged that where there are no immigrants and no jews , there is more racism and anti-semitism , " borstel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has caused unrest in the former gdr neo-nazis were also able to win over some east germans with familiar ideas .
" national socialism often starts out with the idea of socialism , and then that is combined with frustration , unemployment , lack of opportunity , and populations moving away . "
this is the opinion of a former neo-nazi who wants to remain anonymous , working for exit deutschland , an organization that helps people leave the far-right scene .
there is a widespread feeling that the west left the east behind economically .
in the last 20 years , unemployment in the former east has been consistently twice as high as in the west , and the emigration of young eastern germans remains a problem .
statistical evidence shows that german far-right parties tend to prosper in times of economic depression , and the npd has aimed its electoral resources aggressively at the most neglected districts .
the exit deutschland representative , who has counseled numerous former neo-nazis , said that the frustration that comes from being left behind after watching friends leave your home town is a factor common to many of those who turn to right-wing extremism .
" those who stay , for whatever reason - because they ca n't find a job anywhere else , for example - feel an enormous frustration .
that is fertile ground for far-right groups - and for extremist groups in general , " he said .
sympathy for the left this growing eastern german sympathy with the far-right chimed in with a study completed in 2003 , which found that 16 percent of germans had an extreme right-wing world-view - that is , they expressed chauvinistic , anti-semitic , social-darwinist or xenophobic opinions , and tended to trivialize the nazi regime .
in the east , this world-view was found in 23 percent of the population , compared to 14 percent in the west .
this showed a marked change from the early 1990s , when a similar study found far-right-wing opinion more prevalent in the west .
statisticians have linked this switch to a decline in economic expectation .
whereas easterners were more optimistic about their economic prospects in the early 1990s , by the late 1990s , westerners had become more positive about the economy .
behind this turnaround lay a real sense of betrayal .
in a study written in 2005 , political scientist richard stoess wrote , " that the eastern german people overtook their western compatriots in sympathy for right-wing extremism lay in the fact that their initial trust in the western system of democracy and market economy had turned into particularly bitter disappointment . "
neo-nazis for the new century as state authority began to re-assert itself in the east , the far-right developed more subtle ways to organize .
" the structures have become smaller , " said borstel .
" they no longer rely on large parties like the npd , but rather local cells , which are more difficult for the state to break up .
they have become anchored in local communities in a way i thought would never happen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far-right has reinvented itself for the new century this assimilation was mirrored in the far-right political parties , which have spent the past decade making themselves electable in the east .
although the npd have steadily lost ground in the former west , in the east they have gained a foothold in several state parliaments .
" the big bang was the state election of 2004 in saxony , where the npd first gained representation in an eastern german state parliament , " said sundermeyer .
" since then it has very gradually established itself as a ' normal ' party . "

it 's not entirely unjustified , but right-wing extremism in the east has roots in economic hardship . right-wing violence was most dramatic in the first years of the newly unified germany - and more and more often , they occurred in the former east germany .
for three consecutive nights in august 1992 , several hundred neo-nazis - watched by up to 2,000 locals - attacked an apartment block for asylum seekers in the north-eastern town of rostock .
with the police unprepared and initially outnumbered , the violence continued unchecked until it culminated in an arson attack .
the rostock riots quickly achieved international notoriety .
pictures of drunken , violent east germans doing hitler salutes were printed around the world .
this was not the dawn of a new , hopeful country that had been celebrated less than two years before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 1992 arson attack on an asylum shelter in rostock became infamous authority vacuum neo-nazi violence was not just a stain on the former east germany .
over 100 of the 370 rioters arrested in rostock had travelled from the former west , where there was a string of horrific attacks on turkish immigrants in the early nineties .
but rostock cemented the reputation of post-wall eastern germany as a new haven for neo-nazism , and that reputation stuck .
what characterized the rostock riots as specifically east german was the powerlessness of the authorities . for two or three years after the fall of the wall , state institutions in the former german democratic republic were weakened by the period of transition .
police officers suddenly found themselves associated with a discredited regime .
dierk borstel , a researcher into right-wing extremism at the university of bielefeld , described the precarious circumstances in the early 1990s as linked to a lack of functioning insitutions .
" the police force was destabilized and the church had little influence anyway , " borstel told deutsche welle .
" the eastern german trade unions and the pds , the successor party to the former ruling communist sed , had little authority , and the trade unions and industry associations coming in from the west were all very weak in the east . "
worst of many worlds these semi-anarchic conditions were fertile ground for far-right activists in the former east germany , and their cause was further helped by the disappointment and poverty that spread in the east after reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd has scored some electoral success in the last six years " the expectation of east germans after reunification was : ' we 're going to get the security of the east plus the freedoms of the west , " ' borstel says .
" the result was that they lost the securities and could n't afford the freedoms . "
even though the skinhead neo-nazi scene originated in western europe , it already existed in east germany before the fall of the iron curtain .
it was often linked to certain football teams , and occasionally broke out in extreme violence , such as the attack of 30 skinheads on a concert in a church in central east berlin in 1987 .
the far-right movement in the east capitalized on what many describe as the gdr 's denial of its own nazi history .
olaf sundermeyer , author of " in the npd , " a book about the development of germany 's populist far-right national democratic party , believes the gdr 's distanced attitude to hitler 's germany helped feed the neo-nazi movement .
" communist leaders in the gdr said , ' we are an anti-fascist state and we have no responsibility for history .
there are no nazis here . '
of course that was n't true .
there were former nazis in both east and west germany , but there was no denazification in east germany - the nazi history was not dealt with , " he said .
imbalance and injustice east german society was never particularly multicultural , and the government 's immigration policies showed a determination to keep the population monotone .
immigrant workers from other socialist countries like mozambique were sent home if they got pregnant , or as soon as their allotted time ran out .
the lack of a multicultural foundation is still reflected in eastern german society today .
" eastern germany has a lot fewer immigrants - and it has long been acknowledged that where there are no immigrants and no jews , there is more racism and anti-semitism , " borstel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has caused unrest in the former gdr neo-nazis were also able to win over some east germans with familiar ideas .
" national socialism often starts out with the idea of socialism , and then that is combined with frustration , unemployment , lack of opportunity , and populations moving away . "
this is the opinion of a former neo-nazi who wants to remain anonymous , working for exit deutschland , an organization that helps people leave the far-right scene .
there is a widespread feeling that the west left the east behind economically .
in the last 20 years , unemployment in the former east has been consistently twice as high as in the west , and the emigration of young eastern germans remains a problem .
statistical evidence shows that german far-right parties tend to prosper in times of economic depression , and the npd has aimed its electoral resources aggressively at the most neglected districts .
the exit deutschland representative , who has counseled numerous former neo-nazis , said that the frustration that comes from being left behind after watching friends leave your home town is a factor common to many of those who turn to right-wing extremism .
" those who stay , for whatever reason - because they ca n't find a job anywhere else , for example - feel an enormous frustration .
that is fertile ground for far-right groups - and for extremist groups in general , " he said .
sympathy for the left this growing eastern german sympathy with the far-right chimed in with a study completed in 2003 , which found that 16 percent of germans had an extreme right-wing world-view - that is , they expressed chauvinistic , anti-semitic , social-darwinist or xenophobic opinions , and tended to trivialize the nazi regime .
in the east , this world-view was found in 23 percent of the population , compared to 14 percent in the west .
this showed a marked change from the early 1990s , when a similar study found far-right-wing opinion more prevalent in the west .
statisticians have linked this switch to a decline in economic expectation .
whereas easterners were more optimistic about their economic prospects in the early 1990s , by the late 1990s , westerners had become more positive about the economy .
behind this turnaround lay a real sense of betrayal .
in a study written in 2005 , political scientist richard stoess wrote , " that the eastern german people overtook their western compatriots in sympathy for right-wing extremism lay in the fact that their initial trust in the western system of democracy and market economy had turned into particularly bitter disappointment . "
neo-nazis for the new century as state authority began to re-assert itself in the east , the far-right developed more subtle ways to organize .
" the structures have become smaller , " said borstel .
" they no longer rely on large parties like the npd , but rather local cells , which are more difficult for the state to break up .
they have become anchored in local communities in a way i thought would never happen . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far-right has reinvented itself for the new century this assimilation was mirrored in the far-right political parties , which have spent the past decade making themselves electable in the east .
although the npd have steadily lost ground in the former west , in the east they have gained a foothold in several state parliaments .
" the big bang was the state election of 2004 in saxony , where the npd first gained representation in an eastern german state parliament , " said sundermeyer .
" since then it has very gradually established itself as a ' normal ' party . "
the npd was re-elected to the saxony parliament in 2009 , with 5.6 percent of the vote .
the npd 's membership figures had risen from 4,000 in 1995 to 6,800 in 2009 .
the npd has achieved this success by aiming its messages at young people , especially via the internet , and appealing to sentiments shared by the far-left - anti-americanism , anti-israel , anti-globalization .
