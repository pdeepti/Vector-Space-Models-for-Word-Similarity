"
the government council behind the handbook says it wants teachers to be better able to recognize homophobia - and to do something about it .
for many children and young adults , juvenile name-calling is a normal part of adolescence , but some believe it should be clearly put into context by teachers .
lucie otahalova , head of the government council for human rights , said the role of teachers should be to encourage discussion on homosexuality in an effort to combat discrimination .
" we want to give the handbook to these teachers , so they know what homophobia is , what types of students are the perpetrators , what types of students are the victims , and how to solve the problem , " she said .
according to otahalova , the decision to publish the handbook was partly motivated by surveys showing that up to 75 percent of male pupils in the czech republic had negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians .
a fact of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban areas are more accepting of same-sex couples students at the progressive , cosmopolitan londynska primary school in prague appeared to be more open-minded .
" we sometimes say , ' you are gay , ' but we do n't really mean it in the real meaning , " said one young boy .
" i do n't know any and i think they are a little bit funny , but they are only people so i do n't know why to discriminate against them . "
a young girl said she had nothing against homosexuality : " i like these people !
they 're only people , and i do n't have a problem with them . "
the deputy head of the londynska school , vaclav nadvornik , agreed that schools should accept homosexuality as a fact of life , adding that the government booklet would be of great benefit - unless the literature ends up filed away with every other publication the government sends out to schools .
" the way children are educated about -lrb- homosexual people -rrb- depends on the personality of the teacher , " he says .
" the government can do nothing about it . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 27.02.2010 russian state tv woos younger audiences großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian tv is typically a microphone for the government state-controlled television in russia usually tries to stay away from controversial topics .
but as younger viewers increasingly turn toward the internet , tv producers are doing their best to bring them back . channel one 's " mult lichnosti " is a case in point .
the show , whose name translates as " cartoon personalities " but is at the same time a play on the russian for " personality cult , " features satirical 3-d animations of international politicians and russian sports- and pop stars – a stark contrast from previously crude , propaganda-like news programs .
the show 's new year 's edition introduced cartoon figures of prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev , though they are treated lightly and with more respect compared to other international politicians .
even so , this is a minor revolution , according to the general director of channel one , konstantin ernst .
" in our country , there is just no cultural tradition of laughing at those in power , " he said .
" only someone like -lsb- soviet president -rsb- leonid brezhnev - who clung to power even though he was so old and sick he could n't stand straight anymore - was the butt of jokes . "
" but today 's leaders do everything in their power for russia , " he added .
no sign of press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satirization of medvedev and putin on television is uncommon in russia ernst said he did n't have to ask putin or medvedev for permission to portray them in the animated show .
but critics say editors and producers of state tv have gotten used to self-censorship to avoid offending authorities .
that 's why media expert alexeij muhim is skeptical about any changes state media makes to its programming .
" the new programs are definitely no sign of more press freedom , " he said .
" they are instruments to gain more influence on the audience .
the fact that channel one has introduced those information weapons has no relation to freedom of opinion at all . "
racy entertainment another example of new directions in state tv is the soap opera " shkola , " or " school . "
it follows the daily life of a fictional ninth-grade school class in a moscow suburb , where life is gloomy and tough .
the provocative material , which includes bullying , teenage sex and overworked and corrupt teachers , has led the russian parliament to debate the series .
prime minister putin claimed it " shows extreme cases , not an overall tendency , " and warned viewers from taking it too seriously .
but 27-year-old irina shirkova of moscow , who watches the soap regularly , is n't drawn to the show because she thinks it 's realistic .
she watches it , she says , because it 's entertaining .
" i actually never watched channel one – or tv at all , " she said .
" but ' shkola ' has a new and unusual approach .
it 's interesting that they are showing it – i had n't expected that from channel one at all . "

but as younger viewers increasingly turn toward the internet , tv producers are doing their best to bring them back . channel one 's " mult lichnosti " is a case in point .
the show , whose name translates as " cartoon personalities " but is at the same time a play on the russian for " personality cult , " features satirical 3-d animations of international politicians and russian sports- and pop stars – a stark contrast from previously crude , propaganda-like news programs .
the show 's new year 's edition introduced cartoon figures of prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev , though they are treated lightly and with more respect compared to other international politicians .
even so , this is a minor revolution , according to the general director of channel one , konstantin ernst .
" in our country , there is just no cultural tradition of laughing at those in power , " he said .
" only someone like -lsb- soviet president -rsb- leonid brezhnev - who clung to power even though he was so old and sick he could n't stand straight anymore - was the butt of jokes . "

german magazine focus disclosed in early february that north rhine-westphalia state officials were negotiating a purchase of data on 1,500 german clients of swiss banks from a whistleblower in france , who reportedly asked for some 2.5 million euros -lrb- us $ 3.4 million -rrb- .
meanwhile , officials from the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg on friday said they would not buy the bank data , and that they would leave the decision up to the federal government .
chancellor angela merkel has voiced support for the sale , saying the benefit of recovering millions of euros in back-taxes outweighs the moral dilemma of paying for stolen information .
but the federal finance ministry said it would not buy the data , instead offering advice and assistance for states that would choose to go through with the purchase .
recovered money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is to meet his swiss counterpart next week germany requires its citizens to declare all their income worldwide , but an estimated 200 billion euros are hidden by germans in swiss bank accounts , known for their traditional privacy .
since the offer to sell the information first made headlines earlier this year , about 5,900 germans have turned themselves in for tax evasion , according to dieter ondracek , head of the german financial authorities ' trade union dstg .
ondracek said that could help the government recover 500 million euros of lost taxes .
" if we get a signal from the politicians that it 'll only be possible for people to come clean this year , then we could have another 5,000 doing so with corresponding additional revenues , " he told news agency reuters .
" then a billion euros could be possible . "
government meetings the tax data row has caused tension between the swiss and german governments .
switzerland has spoken against buying the data , saying the seller broke swiss law and should not be rewarded .
germany has expressed frustration with their southern neighbor 's secretive tax laws , which seem to invite germans to break their own laws and hide their income .
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is scheduled to host his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz in berlin on tuesday to discuss a new dual taxation agreement .
the swiss government also announced on thursday that it would no longer accept untaxed income in its banks. acb / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the claim , backed by a leading greek newspaper , was made by mep jorgo chatzimarkakis on greek television , despite reports that a senior german official , who declined to be named , had dismissed the comments as " nonsense . "
" germany is planning to buy 5-7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.8 - 9.5 billion -rrb- -lsb- of bonds -rsb- immediately , " said chatzimarkakis , a german of greek heritage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.02.2010 donation scandal surrounding german conservatives widens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu officials offered personal meetings with premier tillich germany 's christian democrats in saxony are facing criticism for their fundraising methods , following a similar scandal in north rhine-westphalia .
meetings with the state premier had been offered for donations . germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- are facing renewed criticism after reports surfaced that personal meetings with another high-ranking party member were offered in exchange for cash .
cdu officials confirmed to german news magazine spiegel that the party had offered personal meetings with stanislaw tillich , cdu state premier of saxony , in exchange for party donations .
michael kretschmer , general secretary of the party , downplayed the practice .
" we 're selling event tickets , not the premier , " said kretschmer .
potential corporate sponsors of the cdu event denkfabrik sachsen , scheduled to take place on monday in dresden , reportedly had the option of sponsoring the party at four different price levels between 500 and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 680 and $ 10,900 -rrb- .
sponsors at the top two levels would have the option of a " short meeting " with tillich , according to the spiegel report .
sponsorship ' necessary ' kretschmer said the sponsorship was necessary to finance the event .
“ we 're expecting between 800 to 1,000 people on monday .
we 're not able to finance that ourselves from the few donations from our party members , ” he told regional public broadcaster mdr .
kretschmer stressed that the situation was nothing like the recent cdu scandal in north rhine-westphalia .

meetings with the state premier had been offered for donations . germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- are facing renewed criticism after reports surfaced that personal meetings with another high-ranking party member were offered in exchange for cash .
cdu officials confirmed to german news magazine spiegel that the party had offered personal meetings with stanislaw tillich , cdu state premier of saxony , in exchange for party donations .
michael kretschmer , general secretary of the party , downplayed the practice .
" we 're selling event tickets , not the premier , " said kretschmer .
potential corporate sponsors of the cdu event denkfabrik sachsen , scheduled to take place on monday in dresden , reportedly had the option of sponsoring the party at four different price levels between 500 and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 680 and $ 10,900 -rrb- .
sponsors at the top two levels would have the option of a " short meeting " with tillich , according to the spiegel report .
sponsorship ' necessary ' kretschmer said the sponsorship was necessary to finance the event .
“ we 're expecting between 800 to 1,000 people on monday .
we 're not able to finance that ourselves from the few donations from our party members , ” he told regional public broadcaster mdr .

german magazine focus disclosed in early february that north rhine-westphalia state officials were negotiating a purchase of data on 1,500 german clients of swiss banks from a whistleblower in france , who reportedly asked for some 2.5 million euros -lrb- us $ 3.4 million -rrb- .
meanwhile , officials from the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg on friday said they would not buy the bank data , and that they would leave the decision up to the federal government .
chancellor angela merkel has voiced support for the sale , saying the benefit of recovering millions of euros in back-taxes outweighs the moral dilemma of paying for stolen information .
but the federal finance ministry said it would not buy the data , instead offering advice and assistance for states that would choose to go through with the purchase .
recovered money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is to meet his swiss counterpart next week germany requires its citizens to declare all their income worldwide , but an estimated 200 billion euros are hidden by germans in swiss bank accounts , known for their traditional privacy .
since the offer to sell the information first made headlines earlier this year , about 5,900 germans have turned themselves in for tax evasion , according to dieter ondracek , head of the german financial authorities ' trade union dstg .
ondracek said that could help the government recover 500 million euros of lost taxes .
" if we get a signal from the politicians that it 'll only be possible for people to come clean this year , then we could have another 5,000 doing so with corresponding additional revenues , " he told news agency reuters .
" then a billion euros could be possible . "
government meetings the tax data row has caused tension between the swiss and german governments .
switzerland has spoken against buying the data , saying the seller broke swiss law and should not be rewarded .
germany has expressed frustration with their southern neighbor 's secretive tax laws , which seem to invite germans to break their own laws and hide their income .
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is scheduled to host his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz in berlin on tuesday to discuss a new dual taxation agreement .
the swiss government also announced on thursday that it would no longer accept untaxed income in its banks. acb / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a senior german official has dismissed the claims . a german member of the european parliament announced saturday that germany , france and the netherlands are planning to buy greek bonds to help athens cope with its debt crisis .
the claim , backed by a leading greek newspaper , was made by mep jorgo chatzimarkakis on greek television , despite reports that a senior german official , who declined to be named , had dismissed the comments as " nonsense . "
" germany is planning to buy 5-7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.8 - 9.5 billion -rrb- -lsb- of bonds -rsb- immediately , " said chatzimarkakis , a german of greek heritage .
he added that germany 's state-owned development bank kfw and france 's state-owned caisse des depots would contribute .
earlier , big german banks deutsche postbank , eurohypo and hypo real estate said they would not be buying any more greek government bonds .
athens plans to issue its second round of bonds this year , possibly in early march , in order to make good on debt payments due in april and may .
greece needs about 20 million euros to prevent a default , which could have potentially catastrophic effects on other eurozone economies .
the greek finance ministry and the european commission declined to comment on the report , and there was no immediate comment from france 's government .

several government officials and opposition politicians have pressured prime minister george papandreou to renew demands that germany compensate greece for hitler 's occupation of the country .
germany claims it has already paid greece billions of euros in reparations .
german foreign ministry spokesman stefan bredohl said berlin and athens had had a " slight disagreement , " but that the german ambassador and the greek parliamentary speaker had recently had an " amicable " meeting .
the rehash of the decades-old war reparations dispute came as the german government announced a march 5 meeting in berlin between papandreou and german chancellor angela merkel .
greece may soon be in need of a government bailout , in which germany would likely play a central role , and which many germans strongly oppose .
speaking to parliament , papandreou said his government could not wait to address the deficit , and that he was optimistic the european union would lend its support .
" we are asking the eu for its solidarity and they are asking us to meet our obligations , " he said .
" we will meet our obligations ...
we will demand european community solidarity , and i believe we will get it . "

meetings with the state premier had been offered for donations . germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- are facing renewed criticism after reports surfaced that personal meetings with another high-ranking party member were offered in exchange for cash .
cdu officials confirmed to german news magazine spiegel that the party had offered personal meetings with stanislaw tillich , cdu state premier of saxony , in exchange for party donations .
michael kretschmer , general secretary of the party , downplayed the practice .
" we 're selling event tickets , not the premier , " said kretschmer .
potential corporate sponsors of the cdu event denkfabrik sachsen , scheduled to take place on monday in dresden , reportedly had the option of sponsoring the party at four different price levels between 500 and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 680 and $ 10,900 -rrb- .
sponsors at the top two levels would have the option of a " short meeting " with tillich , according to the spiegel report .
sponsorship ' necessary ' kretschmer said the sponsorship was necessary to finance the event .
“ we 're expecting between 800 to 1,000 people on monday .
we 're not able to finance that ourselves from the few donations from our party members , ” he told regional public broadcaster mdr .
kretschmer stressed that the situation was nothing like the recent cdu scandal in north rhine-westphalia .
earlier in the week , reports surfaced that cdu officials in north rhine-westphalia had solicited as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,170 -rrb- for a personal conversation with juergen ruettgers , the premier of that state , and other high-ranking cdu leaders .
the meetings were to have taken place at a party convention in march .
in an attempt to divert attention from ruettgers , who is up for re-election in early may , the regional cdu 's general secretary hendrik wuest resigned on monday , assuming full responsibility for the affair. cmk / apn / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 27.02.2010 czech republic promotes gay tolerance in schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech students are to be taught the ills of homophobia the czech government has taken its battle against homophobia to school classrooms in an effort aimed at raising awareness of homosexuality and the problem of bullying based on sexual orientation . as part of the project , a new handbook is being distributed to primary and secondary school teachers called " homophobia in schools . "
the government council behind the handbook says it wants teachers to be better able to recognize homophobia - and to do something about it .
for many children and young adults , juvenile name-calling is a normal part of adolescence , but some believe it should be clearly put into context by teachers .
lucie otahalova , head of the government council for human rights , said the role of teachers should be to encourage discussion on homosexuality in an effort to combat discrimination .
" we want to give the handbook to these teachers , so they know what homophobia is , what types of students are the perpetrators , what types of students are the victims , and how to solve the problem , " she said .
according to otahalova , the decision to publish the handbook was partly motivated by surveys showing that up to 75 percent of male pupils in the czech republic had negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians .
a fact of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban areas are more accepting of same-sex couples students at the progressive , cosmopolitan londynska primary school in prague appeared to be more open-minded .
" we sometimes say , ' you are gay , ' but we do n't really mean it in the real meaning , " said one young boy .
" i do n't know any and i think they are a little bit funny , but they are only people so i do n't know why to discriminate against them . "
a young girl said she had nothing against homosexuality : " i like these people !
they 're only people , and i do n't have a problem with them . "
the deputy head of the londynska school , vaclav nadvornik , agreed that schools should accept homosexuality as a fact of life , adding that the government booklet would be of great benefit - unless the literature ends up filed away with every other publication the government sends out to schools .
" the way children are educated about -lrb- homosexual people -rrb- depends on the personality of the teacher , " he says .
" the government can do nothing about it . "

a senior german official has dismissed the claims . a german member of the european parliament announced saturday that germany , france and the netherlands are planning to buy greek bonds to help athens cope with its debt crisis .
the claim , backed by a leading greek newspaper , was made by mep jorgo chatzimarkakis on greek television , despite reports that a senior german official , who declined to be named , had dismissed the comments as " nonsense . "
" germany is planning to buy 5-7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.8 - 9.5 billion -rrb- -lsb- of bonds -rsb- immediately , " said chatzimarkakis , a german of greek heritage .
he added that germany 's state-owned development bank kfw and france 's state-owned caisse des depots would contribute .
earlier , big german banks deutsche postbank , eurohypo and hypo real estate said they would not be buying any more greek government bonds .
athens plans to issue its second round of bonds this year , possibly in early march , in order to make good on debt payments due in april and may .
greece needs about 20 million euros to prevent a default , which could have potentially catastrophic effects on other eurozone economies .
the greek finance ministry and the european commission declined to comment on the report , and there was no immediate comment from france 's government .

germany claims it has already paid greece billions of euros in reparations .
german foreign ministry spokesman stefan bredohl said berlin and athens had had a " slight disagreement , " but that the german ambassador and the greek parliamentary speaker had recently had an " amicable " meeting .
the rehash of the decades-old war reparations dispute came as the german government announced a march 5 meeting in berlin between papandreou and german chancellor angela merkel .
greece may soon be in need of a government bailout , in which germany would likely play a central role , and which many germans strongly oppose .
speaking to parliament , papandreou said his government could not wait to address the deficit , and that he was optimistic the european union would lend its support .
" we are asking the eu for its solidarity and they are asking us to meet our obligations , " he said .
" we will meet our obligations ...

"
the government council behind the handbook says it wants teachers to be better able to recognize homophobia - and to do something about it .
for many children and young adults , juvenile name-calling is a normal part of adolescence , but some believe it should be clearly put into context by teachers .
lucie otahalova , head of the government council for human rights , said the role of teachers should be to encourage discussion on homosexuality in an effort to combat discrimination .
" we want to give the handbook to these teachers , so they know what homophobia is , what types of students are the perpetrators , what types of students are the victims , and how to solve the problem , " she said .
according to otahalova , the decision to publish the handbook was partly motivated by surveys showing that up to 75 percent of male pupils in the czech republic had negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians .

a young girl said she had nothing against homosexuality : " i like these people !
they 're only people , and i do n't have a problem with them . "
the deputy head of the londynska school , vaclav nadvornik , agreed that schools should accept homosexuality as a fact of life , adding that the government booklet would be of great benefit - unless the literature ends up filed away with every other publication the government sends out to schools .
" the way children are educated about -lrb- homosexual people -rrb- depends on the personality of the teacher , " he says .

a senior german official has dismissed the claims . a german member of the european parliament announced saturday that germany , france and the netherlands are planning to buy greek bonds to help athens cope with its debt crisis .
the claim , backed by a leading greek newspaper , was made by mep jorgo chatzimarkakis on greek television , despite reports that a senior german official , who declined to be named , had dismissed the comments as " nonsense . "
" germany is planning to buy 5-7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.8 - 9.5 billion -rrb- -lsb- of bonds -rsb- immediately , " said chatzimarkakis , a german of greek heritage .
he added that germany 's state-owned development bank kfw and france 's state-owned caisse des depots would contribute .
earlier , big german banks deutsche postbank , eurohypo and hypo real estate said they would not be buying any more greek government bonds .
athens plans to issue its second round of bonds this year , possibly in early march , in order to make good on debt payments due in april and may .
greece needs about 20 million euros to prevent a default , which could have potentially catastrophic effects on other eurozone economies .
the greek finance ministry and the european commission declined to comment on the report , and there was no immediate comment from france 's government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou has said greece will not seek world war ii reparations further tensions on friday , both germany and greece sought to downplay rising tensions as athens said it would not seek world war ii reparations from germany .
several government officials and opposition politicians have pressured prime minister george papandreou to renew demands that germany compensate greece for hitler 's occupation of the country .
germany claims it has already paid greece billions of euros in reparations .
german foreign ministry spokesman stefan bredohl said berlin and athens had had a " slight disagreement , " but that the german ambassador and the greek parliamentary speaker had recently had an " amicable " meeting .
the rehash of the decades-old war reparations dispute came as the german government announced a march 5 meeting in berlin between papandreou and german chancellor angela merkel .
greece may soon be in need of a government bailout , in which germany would likely play a central role , and which many germans strongly oppose .
speaking to parliament , papandreou said his government could not wait to address the deficit , and that he was optimistic the european union would lend its support .
" we are asking the eu for its solidarity and they are asking us to meet our obligations , " he said .
" we will meet our obligations ...
we will demand european community solidarity , and i believe we will get it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a focus cover sparked much controversy calls for boycott parallel to the spat over war reparations , the greek and german press have exchanged mocking words and images .
the latest issue of german news magazine focus featured an image of the venus de milo raising her middle finger on the cover .
a greek newspaper responded by printing an image of the statue atop the victory column in berlin holding a swastika .
the venus image led george lakouritis , president of greece 's oldest consumer group inka , to call on chancellor merkel to condemn the magazine .
the group also distributed leaflets in central athens and in front of the german-owned electronics store media markt calling for a boycott of german goods .
" the distortion of a statue of greek history , beauty and civilization , from a time when there -lrb- in germany -rrb- they were eating bananas on trees is impermissible and unforgivable , " the group said. acb / cmk / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 27.02.2010 piracy problems overshadow rising digital music sales großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of european music downloads are illegal piracy accounts for 95 percent of global music downloads .
as governments begin to change legislation , legal alternatives are growing fast .
but can this be enough to lure music fans back onto the straight and narrow ? the recently released ifpi -lrb- international federation of the phonographic industry -rrb- digital music report 2010 indicated that trade revenues are up 12 percent to an estimated us $ 4.2 billion in 2009 .
however , this figure masks a 10 percent overall decrease in music sales across the board .
“ the elephant in the room here is piracy , ” remarked alex jacob of the ifpi .
“ people are changing their habits but instead of going from buying a cd on the high street to buying a cd from a legal online store like amazon or itunes , they 're actually going to the illegal file-sharing networks and downloading music there ” , he continued .
illicit sharing accounts for around 95 percent of all worldwide music downloads . in the uk alone it is estimated that the music industry lost 250 million pounds to illegal downloads in 2009 .
local artists suffer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physical album sales have fallen dramatically across europe the ifpi report highlights the severe damage piracy is causing to local music industries around the world .
in particular , three countries known for the vibrant music scenes and influential artists - spain , france and brazil - are suffering acutely , with local artist album sales and release volumes plummeting .
spain , which has one of the highest rates of illegal file-sharing in europe , has seen sales by local artists in the top 50 fall by an estimated 65 percent between 2004 and 2009 . in brazil , full priced local album releases from the five largest music companies in 2008 were down 80 percent from their 2005 level .
reluctance to intervene internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- have little or no interest in curbing this illegal activity as they wish to comfort and entice customers with a promise of safety and freedom .
instead , governments are slowly beginning to intervene with legislation changes .
president sarkozy of france led the way in 2009 by introducing a ‘ graduated response ' approach to copyright infringement , whereby users are issued with warnings before any further action is taken .
“ if they continue eventually at the end of the line they get to a sanction which could be temporary account suspension ” , said jacob .
more countries are following suit , both taiwan and south korea have put new laws on the statute books and legislation is going through parliament in the uk and new zealand .
meanwhile a landmark ruling in italy at the beginning of february this year blocked italian access to the infamous bit torrent service ‘ the pirate bay ” – a site that facilitates access to a large amount of copyright infringing material .
“ it is vital these efforts are seen through to their conclusion and followed by other governments in 2010 , " said ifpi chairman and ceo john kennedy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french legislation is designed to push consumers towards legal downloads many however are dismayed at the prospect of such state intervention .
“ disconnecting someone 's broadband in this day and age is tantamount to throwing somebody outside of society entirely ” , says wendy grossman a member of the ‘ open rights group ' , a uk based digital rights organization .
“ for the questionable crime of downloading a music file it seems totally out of proportion to what the offence might be ” , she continued .
branching out the ifpi report also highlights how music companies are diversifying their revenue streams , offering new ways for consumers to buy and access music .
these include : subscription services ; music services bundled with devices and broadband subscriptions ; streaming services with applications for mobile devices ; advertising-supported services that offer premium services ; and online music video services .
in the last year 400 such services were licensed worldwide .
music companies have partnered with advertising-supported services such as spotify , deezer , myspace music and we7 ; isps such as tdc in denmark , terra in brazil and sky in the uk ; mobile operators such as vodafone ; handset makers such as nokia and sony ericsson ; and online video channels such as hulu and vevo .
spotify in particular has seen great success , attracting 7 million users in 6 different countries over the last 12 months .
but this is nowhere near enough to make a dent in the levels of piracy and illegal downloads worldwide .
lack of foresight critics of the big music labels like wendy grossman argue that the big record labels should have responded to the great popularity of the first music file-sharing site ‘ napster ' back in the early 2000s .
the original napster was shut down in 2001 by court order , but was an immediate hit during its three-year existence “ it should have become obvious to the music industry that the thing they should do is set up something similar that they controlled , if i were in the music industry i would be embarrassed by the fact that apple is the biggest retailer of digital music , what is this huge opportunity that these guys missed i do n't understand what they were thinking ! ” said grossman .
looking to the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have aggressive copyright protection efforts struck the wrong chord with consumers ?
tackling piracy lies in securing a joint effort between governments and isps according to the ipfi . this would also allow existing legal services to grow faster , says jacobs “ ultimately more choice will be offered to consumers because the amount of money that can be invested in new artists will start increasing again and that means there will be more choice , more diversity of genres for people to choose from – more chance of the band rehearsing in their garage today getting their break ” jacobs continued to stress that stamping out piracy all together was not on the ifpi 's agenda , “ we are not that naïve ” , he stressed , “ we do n't need in effect to stamp out piracy , but we can control it ” , he said .
wendy grossman however , remains skeptical about the effects of meddling with on-line freedom “ from the perspective of the people that the are prosecuting and chasing and berating , they have declared war on an entire generation of consumers and that is a very bad way to conduct a business because they are alienating their customers , and they are not only alienating their customers , they are alienating their best customers . ”
legal alternatives may be starting to win music industry battles , but for the foreseeable future at least the illegal download is winning the war .

both runs combines , riesch finished with a total time of 1:42.89 , nearly half a second ahead of schild and one second ahead of zahrobska .
all skiers had to contend with snowfall and poor visibility , but riesch proved unshakable in the absence of long-time rival american lindsey vonn .
the victory makes riesch the only athlete to win two gold medals in the alpine events , with the men 's slalom final still to come .

but after my gold in the combined i had a lot of confidence . "

"
the government council behind the handbook says it wants teachers to be better able to recognize homophobia - and to do something about it .
for many children and young adults , juvenile name-calling is a normal part of adolescence , but some believe it should be clearly put into context by teachers .
lucie otahalova , head of the government council for human rights , said the role of teachers should be to encourage discussion on homosexuality in an effort to combat discrimination .
" we want to give the handbook to these teachers , so they know what homophobia is , what types of students are the perpetrators , what types of students are the victims , and how to solve the problem , " she said .
according to otahalova , the decision to publish the handbook was partly motivated by surveys showing that up to 75 percent of male pupils in the czech republic had negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians .
a fact of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban areas are more accepting of same-sex couples students at the progressive , cosmopolitan londynska primary school in prague appeared to be more open-minded .
" we sometimes say , ' you are gay , ' but we do n't really mean it in the real meaning , " said one young boy .
" i do n't know any and i think they are a little bit funny , but they are only people so i do n't know why to discriminate against them . "
a young girl said she had nothing against homosexuality : " i like these people !
they 're only people , and i do n't have a problem with them . "
the deputy head of the londynska school , vaclav nadvornik , agreed that schools should accept homosexuality as a fact of life , adding that the government booklet would be of great benefit - unless the literature ends up filed away with every other publication the government sends out to schools .
" the way children are educated about -lrb- homosexual people -rrb- depends on the personality of the teacher , " he says .
" the government can do nothing about it . "

maurus krass , prior and head of a monastic school in ettal , bavaria , resigned for not relaying to clerical authorities allegations of child sex abuse between 2003 and 2005 .
he was the second to resign in three days after barnabas boegle , also from ettal , stepped down on wednesday for the same reasons .
the german episcopal conference recently appointed stephan ackermann , bishop of the western town of trier , as head of the investigation into the scandal .
he said on friday that he would pursue " with determination " all clues related to abuse committed by members of the church .

meetings with the state premier had been offered for donations . germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- are facing renewed criticism after reports surfaced that personal meetings with another high-ranking party member were offered in exchange for cash .
cdu officials confirmed to german news magazine spiegel that the party had offered personal meetings with stanislaw tillich , cdu state premier of saxony , in exchange for party donations .
michael kretschmer , general secretary of the party , downplayed the practice .
" we 're selling event tickets , not the premier , " said kretschmer .
potential corporate sponsors of the cdu event denkfabrik sachsen , scheduled to take place on monday in dresden , reportedly had the option of sponsoring the party at four different price levels between 500 and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 680 and $ 10,900 -rrb- .
sponsors at the top two levels would have the option of a " short meeting " with tillich , according to the spiegel report .
sponsorship ' necessary ' kretschmer said the sponsorship was necessary to finance the event .
“ we 're expecting between 800 to 1,000 people on monday .
we 're not able to finance that ourselves from the few donations from our party members , ” he told regional public broadcaster mdr .
kretschmer stressed that the situation was nothing like the recent cdu scandal in north rhine-westphalia .
earlier in the week , reports surfaced that cdu officials in north rhine-westphalia had solicited as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,170 -rrb- for a personal conversation with juergen ruettgers , the premier of that state , and other high-ranking cdu leaders .
the meetings were to have taken place at a party convention in march .
in an attempt to divert attention from ruettgers , who is up for re-election in early may , the regional cdu 's general secretary hendrik wuest resigned on monday , assuming full responsibility for the affair. cmk / apn / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the government council behind the handbook says it wants teachers to be better able to recognize homophobia - and to do something about it .
for many children and young adults , juvenile name-calling is a normal part of adolescence , but some believe it should be clearly put into context by teachers .
lucie otahalova , head of the government council for human rights , said the role of teachers should be to encourage discussion on homosexuality in an effort to combat discrimination .
" we want to give the handbook to these teachers , so they know what homophobia is , what types of students are the perpetrators , what types of students are the victims , and how to solve the problem , " she said .
according to otahalova , the decision to publish the handbook was partly motivated by surveys showing that up to 75 percent of male pupils in the czech republic had negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians .

a young girl said she had nothing against homosexuality : " i like these people !

"
the government council behind the handbook says it wants teachers to be better able to recognize homophobia - and to do something about it .
for many children and young adults , juvenile name-calling is a normal part of adolescence , but some believe it should be clearly put into context by teachers .
lucie otahalova , head of the government council for human rights , said the role of teachers should be to encourage discussion on homosexuality in an effort to combat discrimination .
" we want to give the handbook to these teachers , so they know what homophobia is , what types of students are the perpetrators , what types of students are the victims , and how to solve the problem , " she said .
according to otahalova , the decision to publish the handbook was partly motivated by surveys showing that up to 75 percent of male pupils in the czech republic had negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians .
a fact of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban areas are more accepting of same-sex couples students at the progressive , cosmopolitan londynska primary school in prague appeared to be more open-minded .
" we sometimes say , ' you are gay , ' but we do n't really mean it in the real meaning , " said one young boy .
" i do n't know any and i think they are a little bit funny , but they are only people so i do n't know why to discriminate against them . "
a young girl said she had nothing against homosexuality : " i like these people !
they 're only people , and i do n't have a problem with them . "
the deputy head of the londynska school , vaclav nadvornik , agreed that schools should accept homosexuality as a fact of life , adding that the government booklet would be of great benefit - unless the literature ends up filed away with every other publication the government sends out to schools .

meetings with the state premier had been offered for donations . germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- are facing renewed criticism after reports surfaced that personal meetings with another high-ranking party member were offered in exchange for cash .
cdu officials confirmed to german news magazine spiegel that the party had offered personal meetings with stanislaw tillich , cdu state premier of saxony , in exchange for party donations .
michael kretschmer , general secretary of the party , downplayed the practice .
" we 're selling event tickets , not the premier , " said kretschmer .
potential corporate sponsors of the cdu event denkfabrik sachsen , scheduled to take place on monday in dresden , reportedly had the option of sponsoring the party at four different price levels between 500 and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 680 and $ 10,900 -rrb- .
sponsors at the top two levels would have the option of a " short meeting " with tillich , according to the spiegel report .
sponsorship ' necessary ' kretschmer said the sponsorship was necessary to finance the event .
“ we 're expecting between 800 to 1,000 people on monday .
we 're not able to finance that ourselves from the few donations from our party members , ” he told regional public broadcaster mdr .
kretschmer stressed that the situation was nothing like the recent cdu scandal in north rhine-westphalia .
earlier in the week , reports surfaced that cdu officials in north rhine-westphalia had solicited as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,170 -rrb- for a personal conversation with juergen ruettgers , the premier of that state , and other high-ranking cdu leaders .
the meetings were to have taken place at a party convention in march .
in an attempt to divert attention from ruettgers , who is up for re-election in early may , the regional cdu 's general secretary hendrik wuest resigned on monday , assuming full responsibility for the affair. cmk / apn / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a senior german official has dismissed the claims . a german member of the european parliament announced saturday that germany , france and the netherlands are planning to buy greek bonds to help athens cope with its debt crisis .
the claim , backed by a leading greek newspaper , was made by mep jorgo chatzimarkakis on greek television , despite reports that a senior german official , who declined to be named , had dismissed the comments as " nonsense . "
" germany is planning to buy 5-7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.8 - 9.5 billion -rrb- -lsb- of bonds -rsb- immediately , " said chatzimarkakis , a german of greek heritage .
he added that germany 's state-owned development bank kfw and france 's state-owned caisse des depots would contribute .
earlier , big german banks deutsche postbank , eurohypo and hypo real estate said they would not be buying any more greek government bonds .
athens plans to issue its second round of bonds this year , possibly in early march , in order to make good on debt payments due in april and may .
greece needs about 20 million euros to prevent a default , which could have potentially catastrophic effects on other eurozone economies .
the greek finance ministry and the european commission declined to comment on the report , and there was no immediate comment from france 's government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou has said greece will not seek world war ii reparations further tensions on friday , both germany and greece sought to downplay rising tensions as athens said it would not seek world war ii reparations from germany .
several government officials and opposition politicians have pressured prime minister george papandreou to renew demands that germany compensate greece for hitler 's occupation of the country .
germany claims it has already paid greece billions of euros in reparations .
german foreign ministry spokesman stefan bredohl said berlin and athens had had a " slight disagreement , " but that the german ambassador and the greek parliamentary speaker had recently had an " amicable " meeting .
the rehash of the decades-old war reparations dispute came as the german government announced a march 5 meeting in berlin between papandreou and german chancellor angela merkel .
greece may soon be in need of a government bailout , in which germany would likely play a central role , and which many germans strongly oppose .
speaking to parliament , papandreou said his government could not wait to address the deficit , and that he was optimistic the european union would lend its support .
" we are asking the eu for its solidarity and they are asking us to meet our obligations , " he said .
" we will meet our obligations ...
we will demand european community solidarity , and i believe we will get it . "

a greek newspaper responded by printing an image of the statue atop the victory column in berlin holding a swastika .
the venus image led george lakouritis , president of greece 's oldest consumer group inka , to call on chancellor merkel to condemn the magazine .

as part of an ambitious theater project in germany 's ruhr region , audience members undertake an odyssey of their own as they are guided through six cities in two days . the theater project " odyssey europa " was masterminded not by stage directors , but by architects : matthias rick and the collective raumlabourberlin .
the event premieres on february 27-28 as part of the 2010 european capital of culture program in the ruhr region and is repeated on march 6-7 , march 13-14 , april 2-3 , and may 22-23 . deutsche welle : matthias rick , you are , literally , the architect of odyssey europa .
what does that mean ?
what role does your architectural collective play in this ambitious theater project ? matthias rick : six authors from different countries have been invited to present their own contemporary interpretations of homer 's odyssey .
the pieces they have written will be performed in six different theaters in six different cities across the ruhr region .
raumlabor have been invited to create the trip between the theater pieces - the " odyssey , " in fact . what is the " odyssey " ?
what will happen to the audience when they arrive ? you will arrive saturday morning in front of the first theater .
you will have to " check in " - because you are crossing a border - and then you are inside this project .
you will see the first piece . hospitality is a central idea in " odyssey , " so we have invited the citizens of the area to act as hosts .
after the first piece , a host will greet you and take you to the next theater .
this will be a local person who will take you in his car , on the subway or whatever .
it 's entirely his or her decision . bildunterschrift : in addition to the journey , audiences view six theater productions in various cities in the ruhr region the project takes place over two days .
how does this work in practice ? on the first day you will see performances in three cities : essen , oberhausen and bochum .
then comes the night , which you will be invited to spend in your host 's home .
then we have the second day in muellheim , moers and dortmund .
the transport in between the cities will vary according to the preference of your host .
it could be cars , boats , buses , metros … everyone knows that odysseus was trying to get home .
in a sprawling industrial metropolis made up of 53 separate cities , where is home ? that 's a good question .
it is the question " odyssey " is asking : where is home ?
how do you find home ?
it 's the main theme of the theater pieces and it 's also a question which has been very important to us in creating the tour .
we call this trip " an odyssey through the world in-between . " i think one of the characteristics of this region is this world between the cities : empty spaces .
we have islands - the theater pieces are the islands and our journey is like shipping between these islands . it 's a very special concept .
perhaps that 's why they asked an architect ! interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a senior german official has dismissed the claims . a german member of the european parliament announced saturday that germany , france and the netherlands are planning to buy greek bonds to help athens cope with its debt crisis .
the claim , backed by a leading greek newspaper , was made by mep jorgo chatzimarkakis on greek television , despite reports that a senior german official , who declined to be named , had dismissed the comments as " nonsense . "
" germany is planning to buy 5-7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.8 - 9.5 billion -rrb- -lsb- of bonds -rsb- immediately , " said chatzimarkakis , a german of greek heritage .
he added that germany 's state-owned development bank kfw and france 's state-owned caisse des depots would contribute .
earlier , big german banks deutsche postbank , eurohypo and hypo real estate said they would not be buying any more greek government bonds .
athens plans to issue its second round of bonds this year , possibly in early march , in order to make good on debt payments due in april and may .
greece needs about 20 million euros to prevent a default , which could have potentially catastrophic effects on other eurozone economies .
the greek finance ministry and the european commission declined to comment on the report , and there was no immediate comment from france 's government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou has said greece will not seek world war ii reparations further tensions on friday , both germany and greece sought to downplay rising tensions as athens said it would not seek world war ii reparations from germany .
several government officials and opposition politicians have pressured prime minister george papandreou to renew demands that germany compensate greece for hitler 's occupation of the country .
germany claims it has already paid greece billions of euros in reparations .
german foreign ministry spokesman stefan bredohl said berlin and athens had had a " slight disagreement , " but that the german ambassador and the greek parliamentary speaker had recently had an " amicable " meeting .
the rehash of the decades-old war reparations dispute came as the german government announced a march 5 meeting in berlin between papandreou and german chancellor angela merkel .
greece may soon be in need of a government bailout , in which germany would likely play a central role , and which many germans strongly oppose .
speaking to parliament , papandreou said his government could not wait to address the deficit , and that he was optimistic the european union would lend its support .
" we are asking the eu for its solidarity and they are asking us to meet our obligations , " he said .
" we will meet our obligations ...
we will demand european community solidarity , and i believe we will get it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a focus cover sparked much controversy calls for boycott parallel to the spat over war reparations , the greek and german press have exchanged mocking words and images .
the latest issue of german news magazine focus featured an image of the venus de milo raising her middle finger on the cover .
a greek newspaper responded by printing an image of the statue atop the victory column in berlin holding a swastika .
the venus image led george lakouritis , president of greece 's oldest consumer group inka , to call on chancellor merkel to condemn the magazine .
the group also distributed leaflets in central athens and in front of the german-owned electronics store media markt calling for a boycott of german goods .
" the distortion of a statue of greek history , beauty and civilization , from a time when there -lrb- in germany -rrb- they were eating bananas on trees is impermissible and unforgivable , " the group said. acb / cmk / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 27.02.2010 russian state tv woos younger audiences großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian tv is typically a microphone for the government state-controlled television in russia usually tries to stay away from controversial topics .
but as younger viewers increasingly turn toward the internet , tv producers are doing their best to bring them back . channel one 's " mult lichnosti " is a case in point .
the show , whose name translates as " cartoon personalities " but is at the same time a play on the russian for " personality cult , " features satirical 3-d animations of international politicians and russian sports- and pop stars – a stark contrast from previously crude , propaganda-like news programs .
the show 's new year 's edition introduced cartoon figures of prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev , though they are treated lightly and with more respect compared to other international politicians .
even so , this is a minor revolution , according to the general director of channel one , konstantin ernst .
" in our country , there is just no cultural tradition of laughing at those in power , " he said .
" only someone like -lsb- soviet president -rsb- leonid brezhnev - who clung to power even though he was so old and sick he could n't stand straight anymore - was the butt of jokes . "
" but today 's leaders do everything in their power for russia , " he added .
no sign of press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satirization of medvedev and putin on television is uncommon in russia ernst said he did n't have to ask putin or medvedev for permission to portray them in the animated show .
but critics say editors and producers of state tv have gotten used to self-censorship to avoid offending authorities .
that 's why media expert alexeij muhim is skeptical about any changes state media makes to its programming .
" the new programs are definitely no sign of more press freedom , " he said .
" they are instruments to gain more influence on the audience .
the fact that channel one has introduced those information weapons has no relation to freedom of opinion at all . "
racy entertainment another example of new directions in state tv is the soap opera " shkola , " or " school . "
it follows the daily life of a fictional ninth-grade school class in a moscow suburb , where life is gloomy and tough .
the provocative material , which includes bullying , teenage sex and overworked and corrupt teachers , has led the russian parliament to debate the series .
prime minister putin claimed it " shows extreme cases , not an overall tendency , " and warned viewers from taking it too seriously .
but 27-year-old irina shirkova of moscow , who watches the soap regularly , is n't drawn to the show because she thinks it 's realistic .
she watches it , she says , because it 's entertaining .
" i actually never watched channel one – or tv at all , " she said .
" but ' shkola ' has a new and unusual approach .
it 's interesting that they are showing it – i had n't expected that from channel one at all . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 27.02.2010 russian state tv woos younger audiences großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian tv is typically a microphone for the government state-controlled television in russia usually tries to stay away from controversial topics .
but as younger viewers increasingly turn toward the internet , tv producers are doing their best to bring them back . channel one 's " mult lichnosti " is a case in point .
the show , whose name translates as " cartoon personalities " but is at the same time a play on the russian for " personality cult , " features satirical 3-d animations of international politicians and russian sports- and pop stars – a stark contrast from previously crude , propaganda-like news programs .
the show 's new year 's edition introduced cartoon figures of prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev , though they are treated lightly and with more respect compared to other international politicians .
even so , this is a minor revolution , according to the general director of channel one , konstantin ernst .
" in our country , there is just no cultural tradition of laughing at those in power , " he said .
" only someone like -lsb- soviet president -rsb- leonid brezhnev - who clung to power even though he was so old and sick he could n't stand straight anymore - was the butt of jokes . "
" but today 's leaders do everything in their power for russia , " he added .
no sign of press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satirization of medvedev and putin on television is uncommon in russia ernst said he did n't have to ask putin or medvedev for permission to portray them in the animated show .
but critics say editors and producers of state tv have gotten used to self-censorship to avoid offending authorities .
that 's why media expert alexeij muhim is skeptical about any changes state media makes to its programming .
" the new programs are definitely no sign of more press freedom , " he said .
" they are instruments to gain more influence on the audience .
the fact that channel one has introduced those information weapons has no relation to freedom of opinion at all . "
racy entertainment another example of new directions in state tv is the soap opera " shkola , " or " school . "
it follows the daily life of a fictional ninth-grade school class in a moscow suburb , where life is gloomy and tough .
the provocative material , which includes bullying , teenage sex and overworked and corrupt teachers , has led the russian parliament to debate the series .
prime minister putin claimed it " shows extreme cases , not an overall tendency , " and warned viewers from taking it too seriously .
but 27-year-old irina shirkova of moscow , who watches the soap regularly , is n't drawn to the show because she thinks it 's realistic .
she watches it , she says , because it 's entertaining .
" i actually never watched channel one – or tv at all , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 27.02.2010 russian state tv woos younger audiences großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian tv is typically a microphone for the government state-controlled television in russia usually tries to stay away from controversial topics .
but as younger viewers increasingly turn toward the internet , tv producers are doing their best to bring them back . channel one 's " mult lichnosti " is a case in point .
the show , whose name translates as " cartoon personalities " but is at the same time a play on the russian for " personality cult , " features satirical 3-d animations of international politicians and russian sports- and pop stars – a stark contrast from previously crude , propaganda-like news programs .
the show 's new year 's edition introduced cartoon figures of prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev , though they are treated lightly and with more respect compared to other international politicians .
even so , this is a minor revolution , according to the general director of channel one , konstantin ernst .
" in our country , there is just no cultural tradition of laughing at those in power , " he said .
" only someone like -lsb- soviet president -rsb- leonid brezhnev - who clung to power even though he was so old and sick he could n't stand straight anymore - was the butt of jokes . "
" but today 's leaders do everything in their power for russia , " he added .
no sign of press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satirization of medvedev and putin on television is uncommon in russia ernst said he did n't have to ask putin or medvedev for permission to portray them in the animated show .
but critics say editors and producers of state tv have gotten used to self-censorship to avoid offending authorities .
that 's why media expert alexeij muhim is skeptical about any changes state media makes to its programming .
" the new programs are definitely no sign of more press freedom , " he said .
" they are instruments to gain more influence on the audience .
the fact that channel one has introduced those information weapons has no relation to freedom of opinion at all . "
racy entertainment another example of new directions in state tv is the soap opera " shkola , " or " school . "
it follows the daily life of a fictional ninth-grade school class in a moscow suburb , where life is gloomy and tough .
the provocative material , which includes bullying , teenage sex and overworked and corrupt teachers , has led the russian parliament to debate the series .
prime minister putin claimed it " shows extreme cases , not an overall tendency , " and warned viewers from taking it too seriously .
but 27-year-old irina shirkova of moscow , who watches the soap regularly , is n't drawn to the show because she thinks it 's realistic .
she watches it , she says , because it 's entertaining .
" i actually never watched channel one – or tv at all , " she said .
" but ' shkola ' has a new and unusual approach .
it 's interesting that they are showing it – i had n't expected that from channel one at all . "

"
the government council behind the handbook says it wants teachers to be better able to recognize homophobia - and to do something about it .
for many children and young adults , juvenile name-calling is a normal part of adolescence , but some believe it should be clearly put into context by teachers .
lucie otahalova , head of the government council for human rights , said the role of teachers should be to encourage discussion on homosexuality in an effort to combat discrimination .
" we want to give the handbook to these teachers , so they know what homophobia is , what types of students are the perpetrators , what types of students are the victims , and how to solve the problem , " she said .
according to otahalova , the decision to publish the handbook was partly motivated by surveys showing that up to 75 percent of male pupils in the czech republic had negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians .

a senior german official has dismissed the claims . a german member of the european parliament announced saturday that germany , france and the netherlands are planning to buy greek bonds to help athens cope with its debt crisis .
the claim , backed by a leading greek newspaper , was made by mep jorgo chatzimarkakis on greek television , despite reports that a senior german official , who declined to be named , had dismissed the comments as " nonsense . "
" germany is planning to buy 5-7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.8 - 9.5 billion -rrb- -lsb- of bonds -rsb- immediately , " said chatzimarkakis , a german of greek heritage .
he added that germany 's state-owned development bank kfw and france 's state-owned caisse des depots would contribute .

but as younger viewers increasingly turn toward the internet , tv producers are doing their best to bring them back . channel one 's " mult lichnosti " is a case in point .
the show , whose name translates as " cartoon personalities " but is at the same time a play on the russian for " personality cult , " features satirical 3-d animations of international politicians and russian sports- and pop stars – a stark contrast from previously crude , propaganda-like news programs .
the show 's new year 's edition introduced cartoon figures of prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev , though they are treated lightly and with more respect compared to other international politicians .
even so , this is a minor revolution , according to the general director of channel one , konstantin ernst .
" in our country , there is just no cultural tradition of laughing at those in power , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 27.02.2010 donation scandal surrounding german conservatives widens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu officials offered personal meetings with premier tillich germany 's christian democrats in saxony are facing criticism for their fundraising methods , following a similar scandal in north rhine-westphalia .
meetings with the state premier had been offered for donations . germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- are facing renewed criticism after reports surfaced that personal meetings with another high-ranking party member were offered in exchange for cash .
cdu officials confirmed to german news magazine spiegel that the party had offered personal meetings with stanislaw tillich , cdu state premier of saxony , in exchange for party donations .
michael kretschmer , general secretary of the party , downplayed the practice .
" we 're selling event tickets , not the premier , " said kretschmer .
potential corporate sponsors of the cdu event denkfabrik sachsen , scheduled to take place on monday in dresden , reportedly had the option of sponsoring the party at four different price levels between 500 and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 680 and $ 10,900 -rrb- .
sponsors at the top two levels would have the option of a " short meeting " with tillich , according to the spiegel report .
sponsorship ' necessary ' kretschmer said the sponsorship was necessary to finance the event .
“ we 're expecting between 800 to 1,000 people on monday .
we 're not able to finance that ourselves from the few donations from our party members , ” he told regional public broadcaster mdr .
kretschmer stressed that the situation was nothing like the recent cdu scandal in north rhine-westphalia .

meetings with the state premier had been offered for donations . germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- are facing renewed criticism after reports surfaced that personal meetings with another high-ranking party member were offered in exchange for cash .
cdu officials confirmed to german news magazine spiegel that the party had offered personal meetings with stanislaw tillich , cdu state premier of saxony , in exchange for party donations .
michael kretschmer , general secretary of the party , downplayed the practice .
" we 're selling event tickets , not the premier , " said kretschmer .
potential corporate sponsors of the cdu event denkfabrik sachsen , scheduled to take place on monday in dresden , reportedly had the option of sponsoring the party at four different price levels between 500 and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 680 and $ 10,900 -rrb- .
sponsors at the top two levels would have the option of a " short meeting " with tillich , according to the spiegel report .
sponsorship ' necessary ' kretschmer said the sponsorship was necessary to finance the event .
“ we 're expecting between 800 to 1,000 people on monday .
we 're not able to finance that ourselves from the few donations from our party members , ” he told regional public broadcaster mdr .
kretschmer stressed that the situation was nothing like the recent cdu scandal in north rhine-westphalia .
earlier in the week , reports surfaced that cdu officials in north rhine-westphalia had solicited as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,170 -rrb- for a personal conversation with juergen ruettgers , the premier of that state , and other high-ranking cdu leaders .
the meetings were to have taken place at a party convention in march .
in an attempt to divert attention from ruettgers , who is up for re-election in early may , the regional cdu 's general secretary hendrik wuest resigned on monday , assuming full responsibility for the affair. cmk / apn / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a senior german official has dismissed the claims . a german member of the european parliament announced saturday that germany , france and the netherlands are planning to buy greek bonds to help athens cope with its debt crisis .
the claim , backed by a leading greek newspaper , was made by mep jorgo chatzimarkakis on greek television , despite reports that a senior german official , who declined to be named , had dismissed the comments as " nonsense . "
" germany is planning to buy 5-7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.8 - 9.5 billion -rrb- -lsb- of bonds -rsb- immediately , " said chatzimarkakis , a german of greek heritage .
he added that germany 's state-owned development bank kfw and france 's state-owned caisse des depots would contribute .
earlier , big german banks deutsche postbank , eurohypo and hypo real estate said they would not be buying any more greek government bonds .
athens plans to issue its second round of bonds this year , possibly in early march , in order to make good on debt payments due in april and may .
greece needs about 20 million euros to prevent a default , which could have potentially catastrophic effects on other eurozone economies .
the greek finance ministry and the european commission declined to comment on the report , and there was no immediate comment from france 's government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou has said greece will not seek world war ii reparations further tensions on friday , both germany and greece sought to downplay rising tensions as athens said it would not seek world war ii reparations from germany .
several government officials and opposition politicians have pressured prime minister george papandreou to renew demands that germany compensate greece for hitler 's occupation of the country .
germany claims it has already paid greece billions of euros in reparations .
german foreign ministry spokesman stefan bredohl said berlin and athens had had a " slight disagreement , " but that the german ambassador and the greek parliamentary speaker had recently had an " amicable " meeting .
the rehash of the decades-old war reparations dispute came as the german government announced a march 5 meeting in berlin between papandreou and german chancellor angela merkel .
greece may soon be in need of a government bailout , in which germany would likely play a central role , and which many germans strongly oppose .
speaking to parliament , papandreou said his government could not wait to address the deficit , and that he was optimistic the european union would lend its support .
" we are asking the eu for its solidarity and they are asking us to meet our obligations , " he said .
" we will meet our obligations ...
we will demand european community solidarity , and i believe we will get it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a focus cover sparked much controversy calls for boycott parallel to the spat over war reparations , the greek and german press have exchanged mocking words and images .
the latest issue of german news magazine focus featured an image of the venus de milo raising her middle finger on the cover .
a greek newspaper responded by printing an image of the statue atop the victory column in berlin holding a swastika .
the venus image led george lakouritis , president of greece 's oldest consumer group inka , to call on chancellor merkel to condemn the magazine .
the group also distributed leaflets in central athens and in front of the german-owned electronics store media markt calling for a boycott of german goods .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 27.02.2010 czech republic promotes gay tolerance in schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech students are to be taught the ills of homophobia the czech government has taken its battle against homophobia to school classrooms in an effort aimed at raising awareness of homosexuality and the problem of bullying based on sexual orientation . as part of the project , a new handbook is being distributed to primary and secondary school teachers called " homophobia in schools . "
the government council behind the handbook says it wants teachers to be better able to recognize homophobia - and to do something about it .
for many children and young adults , juvenile name-calling is a normal part of adolescence , but some believe it should be clearly put into context by teachers .
lucie otahalova , head of the government council for human rights , said the role of teachers should be to encourage discussion on homosexuality in an effort to combat discrimination .
" we want to give the handbook to these teachers , so they know what homophobia is , what types of students are the perpetrators , what types of students are the victims , and how to solve the problem , " she said .
according to otahalova , the decision to publish the handbook was partly motivated by surveys showing that up to 75 percent of male pupils in the czech republic had negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians .
a fact of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban areas are more accepting of same-sex couples students at the progressive , cosmopolitan londynska primary school in prague appeared to be more open-minded .
" we sometimes say , ' you are gay , ' but we do n't really mean it in the real meaning , " said one young boy .
" i do n't know any and i think they are a little bit funny , but they are only people so i do n't know why to discriminate against them . "
a young girl said she had nothing against homosexuality : " i like these people !
they 're only people , and i do n't have a problem with them . "
the deputy head of the londynska school , vaclav nadvornik , agreed that schools should accept homosexuality as a fact of life , adding that the government booklet would be of great benefit - unless the literature ends up filed away with every other publication the government sends out to schools .
" the way children are educated about -lrb- homosexual people -rrb- depends on the personality of the teacher , " he says .
" the government can do nothing about it . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 27.02.2010 russian state tv woos younger audiences großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian tv is typically a microphone for the government state-controlled television in russia usually tries to stay away from controversial topics .
but as younger viewers increasingly turn toward the internet , tv producers are doing their best to bring them back . channel one 's " mult lichnosti " is a case in point .
the show , whose name translates as " cartoon personalities " but is at the same time a play on the russian for " personality cult , " features satirical 3-d animations of international politicians and russian sports- and pop stars – a stark contrast from previously crude , propaganda-like news programs .
the show 's new year 's edition introduced cartoon figures of prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev , though they are treated lightly and with more respect compared to other international politicians .
even so , this is a minor revolution , according to the general director of channel one , konstantin ernst .
" in our country , there is just no cultural tradition of laughing at those in power , " he said .
" only someone like -lsb- soviet president -rsb- leonid brezhnev - who clung to power even though he was so old and sick he could n't stand straight anymore - was the butt of jokes . "
" but today 's leaders do everything in their power for russia , " he added .
no sign of press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satirization of medvedev and putin on television is uncommon in russia ernst said he did n't have to ask putin or medvedev for permission to portray them in the animated show .
but critics say editors and producers of state tv have gotten used to self-censorship to avoid offending authorities .
that 's why media expert alexeij muhim is skeptical about any changes state media makes to its programming .
" the new programs are definitely no sign of more press freedom , " he said .
" they are instruments to gain more influence on the audience .
the fact that channel one has introduced those information weapons has no relation to freedom of opinion at all . "
racy entertainment another example of new directions in state tv is the soap opera " shkola , " or " school . "
it follows the daily life of a fictional ninth-grade school class in a moscow suburb , where life is gloomy and tough .
the provocative material , which includes bullying , teenage sex and overworked and corrupt teachers , has led the russian parliament to debate the series .
prime minister putin claimed it " shows extreme cases , not an overall tendency , " and warned viewers from taking it too seriously .
but 27-year-old irina shirkova of moscow , who watches the soap regularly , is n't drawn to the show because she thinks it 's realistic .
she watches it , she says , because it 's entertaining .
" i actually never watched channel one – or tv at all , " she said .
" but ' shkola ' has a new and unusual approach .
it 's interesting that they are showing it – i had n't expected that from channel one at all . "

but 27-year-old irina shirkova of moscow , who watches the soap regularly , is n't drawn to the show because she thinks it 's realistic .
she watches it , she says , because it 's entertaining .
" i actually never watched channel one – or tv at all , " she said .
" but ' shkola ' has a new and unusual approach .
it 's interesting that they are showing it – i had n't expected that from channel one at all . "

"
the government council behind the handbook says it wants teachers to be better able to recognize homophobia - and to do something about it .
for many children and young adults , juvenile name-calling is a normal part of adolescence , but some believe it should be clearly put into context by teachers .
lucie otahalova , head of the government council for human rights , said the role of teachers should be to encourage discussion on homosexuality in an effort to combat discrimination .
" we want to give the handbook to these teachers , so they know what homophobia is , what types of students are the perpetrators , what types of students are the victims , and how to solve the problem , " she said .
according to otahalova , the decision to publish the handbook was partly motivated by surveys showing that up to 75 percent of male pupils in the czech republic had negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 27.02.2010 czech republic promotes gay tolerance in schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech students are to be taught the ills of homophobia the czech government has taken its battle against homophobia to school classrooms in an effort aimed at raising awareness of homosexuality and the problem of bullying based on sexual orientation . as part of the project , a new handbook is being distributed to primary and secondary school teachers called " homophobia in schools . "
the government council behind the handbook says it wants teachers to be better able to recognize homophobia - and to do something about it .
for many children and young adults , juvenile name-calling is a normal part of adolescence , but some believe it should be clearly put into context by teachers .
lucie otahalova , head of the government council for human rights , said the role of teachers should be to encourage discussion on homosexuality in an effort to combat discrimination .
" we want to give the handbook to these teachers , so they know what homophobia is , what types of students are the perpetrators , what types of students are the victims , and how to solve the problem , " she said .
according to otahalova , the decision to publish the handbook was partly motivated by surveys showing that up to 75 percent of male pupils in the czech republic had negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians .
a fact of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban areas are more accepting of same-sex couples students at the progressive , cosmopolitan londynska primary school in prague appeared to be more open-minded .
" we sometimes say , ' you are gay , ' but we do n't really mean it in the real meaning , " said one young boy .
" i do n't know any and i think they are a little bit funny , but they are only people so i do n't know why to discriminate against them . "
a young girl said she had nothing against homosexuality : " i like these people !
they 're only people , and i do n't have a problem with them . "
the deputy head of the londynska school , vaclav nadvornik , agreed that schools should accept homosexuality as a fact of life , adding that the government booklet would be of great benefit - unless the literature ends up filed away with every other publication the government sends out to schools .
" the way children are educated about -lrb- homosexual people -rrb- depends on the personality of the teacher , " he says .
" the government can do nothing about it . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 27.02.2010 czech republic promotes gay tolerance in schools großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech students are to be taught the ills of homophobia the czech government has taken its battle against homophobia to school classrooms in an effort aimed at raising awareness of homosexuality and the problem of bullying based on sexual orientation . as part of the project , a new handbook is being distributed to primary and secondary school teachers called " homophobia in schools . "
the government council behind the handbook says it wants teachers to be better able to recognize homophobia - and to do something about it .
for many children and young adults , juvenile name-calling is a normal part of adolescence , but some believe it should be clearly put into context by teachers .
lucie otahalova , head of the government council for human rights , said the role of teachers should be to encourage discussion on homosexuality in an effort to combat discrimination .
" we want to give the handbook to these teachers , so they know what homophobia is , what types of students are the perpetrators , what types of students are the victims , and how to solve the problem , " she said .
according to otahalova , the decision to publish the handbook was partly motivated by surveys showing that up to 75 percent of male pupils in the czech republic had negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians .
a fact of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban areas are more accepting of same-sex couples students at the progressive , cosmopolitan londynska primary school in prague appeared to be more open-minded .
" we sometimes say , ' you are gay , ' but we do n't really mean it in the real meaning , " said one young boy .
" i do n't know any and i think they are a little bit funny , but they are only people so i do n't know why to discriminate against them . "
a young girl said she had nothing against homosexuality : " i like these people !
they 're only people , and i do n't have a problem with them . "
the deputy head of the londynska school , vaclav nadvornik , agreed that schools should accept homosexuality as a fact of life , adding that the government booklet would be of great benefit - unless the literature ends up filed away with every other publication the government sends out to schools .
" the way children are educated about -lrb- homosexual people -rrb- depends on the personality of the teacher , " he says .
" the government can do nothing about it . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 27.02.2010 russian state tv woos younger audiences großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian tv is typically a microphone for the government state-controlled television in russia usually tries to stay away from controversial topics .
but as younger viewers increasingly turn toward the internet , tv producers are doing their best to bring them back . channel one 's " mult lichnosti " is a case in point .
the show , whose name translates as " cartoon personalities " but is at the same time a play on the russian for " personality cult , " features satirical 3-d animations of international politicians and russian sports- and pop stars – a stark contrast from previously crude , propaganda-like news programs .
the show 's new year 's edition introduced cartoon figures of prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev , though they are treated lightly and with more respect compared to other international politicians .
even so , this is a minor revolution , according to the general director of channel one , konstantin ernst .
" in our country , there is just no cultural tradition of laughing at those in power , " he said .
" only someone like -lsb- soviet president -rsb- leonid brezhnev - who clung to power even though he was so old and sick he could n't stand straight anymore - was the butt of jokes . "
" but today 's leaders do everything in their power for russia , " he added .
no sign of press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satirization of medvedev and putin on television is uncommon in russia ernst said he did n't have to ask putin or medvedev for permission to portray them in the animated show .
but critics say editors and producers of state tv have gotten used to self-censorship to avoid offending authorities .
that 's why media expert alexeij muhim is skeptical about any changes state media makes to its programming .
" the new programs are definitely no sign of more press freedom , " he said .
" they are instruments to gain more influence on the audience .
the fact that channel one has introduced those information weapons has no relation to freedom of opinion at all . "
racy entertainment another example of new directions in state tv is the soap opera " shkola , " or " school . "
it follows the daily life of a fictional ninth-grade school class in a moscow suburb , where life is gloomy and tough .
the provocative material , which includes bullying , teenage sex and overworked and corrupt teachers , has led the russian parliament to debate the series .
prime minister putin claimed it " shows extreme cases , not an overall tendency , " and warned viewers from taking it too seriously .
but 27-year-old irina shirkova of moscow , who watches the soap regularly , is n't drawn to the show because she thinks it 's realistic .
she watches it , she says , because it 's entertaining .
" i actually never watched channel one – or tv at all , " she said .
" but ' shkola ' has a new and unusual approach .
it 's interesting that they are showing it – i had n't expected that from channel one at all . "

a senior german official has dismissed the claims . a german member of the european parliament announced saturday that germany , france and the netherlands are planning to buy greek bonds to help athens cope with its debt crisis .
the claim , backed by a leading greek newspaper , was made by mep jorgo chatzimarkakis on greek television , despite reports that a senior german official , who declined to be named , had dismissed the comments as " nonsense . "
" germany is planning to buy 5-7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.8 - 9.5 billion -rrb- -lsb- of bonds -rsb- immediately , " said chatzimarkakis , a german of greek heritage .
he added that germany 's state-owned development bank kfw and france 's state-owned caisse des depots would contribute .
earlier , big german banks deutsche postbank , eurohypo and hypo real estate said they would not be buying any more greek government bonds .
athens plans to issue its second round of bonds this year , possibly in early march , in order to make good on debt payments due in april and may .
greece needs about 20 million euros to prevent a default , which could have potentially catastrophic effects on other eurozone economies .
the greek finance ministry and the european commission declined to comment on the report , and there was no immediate comment from france 's government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou has said greece will not seek world war ii reparations further tensions on friday , both germany and greece sought to downplay rising tensions as athens said it would not seek world war ii reparations from germany .
several government officials and opposition politicians have pressured prime minister george papandreou to renew demands that germany compensate greece for hitler 's occupation of the country .
germany claims it has already paid greece billions of euros in reparations .
german foreign ministry spokesman stefan bredohl said berlin and athens had had a " slight disagreement , " but that the german ambassador and the greek parliamentary speaker had recently had an " amicable " meeting .
the rehash of the decades-old war reparations dispute came as the german government announced a march 5 meeting in berlin between papandreou and german chancellor angela merkel .
greece may soon be in need of a government bailout , in which germany would likely play a central role , and which many germans strongly oppose .
speaking to parliament , papandreou said his government could not wait to address the deficit , and that he was optimistic the european union would lend its support .
" we are asking the eu for its solidarity and they are asking us to meet our obligations , " he said .
" we will meet our obligations ...
we will demand european community solidarity , and i believe we will get it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a focus cover sparked much controversy calls for boycott parallel to the spat over war reparations , the greek and german press have exchanged mocking words and images .
the latest issue of german news magazine focus featured an image of the venus de milo raising her middle finger on the cover .
a greek newspaper responded by printing an image of the statue atop the victory column in berlin holding a swastika .
the venus image led george lakouritis , president of greece 's oldest consumer group inka , to call on chancellor merkel to condemn the magazine .
the group also distributed leaflets in central athens and in front of the german-owned electronics store media markt calling for a boycott of german goods .
" the distortion of a statue of greek history , beauty and civilization , from a time when there -lrb- in germany -rrb- they were eating bananas on trees is impermissible and unforgivable , " the group said. acb / cmk / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a senior german official has dismissed the claims . a german member of the european parliament announced saturday that germany , france and the netherlands are planning to buy greek bonds to help athens cope with its debt crisis .
the claim , backed by a leading greek newspaper , was made by mep jorgo chatzimarkakis on greek television , despite reports that a senior german official , who declined to be named , had dismissed the comments as " nonsense . "
" germany is planning to buy 5-7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.8 - 9.5 billion -rrb- -lsb- of bonds -rsb- immediately , " said chatzimarkakis , a german of greek heritage .
he added that germany 's state-owned development bank kfw and france 's state-owned caisse des depots would contribute .
earlier , big german banks deutsche postbank , eurohypo and hypo real estate said they would not be buying any more greek government bonds .
athens plans to issue its second round of bonds this year , possibly in early march , in order to make good on debt payments due in april and may .
greece needs about 20 million euros to prevent a default , which could have potentially catastrophic effects on other eurozone economies .
the greek finance ministry and the european commission declined to comment on the report , and there was no immediate comment from france 's government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou has said greece will not seek world war ii reparations further tensions on friday , both germany and greece sought to downplay rising tensions as athens said it would not seek world war ii reparations from germany .
several government officials and opposition politicians have pressured prime minister george papandreou to renew demands that germany compensate greece for hitler 's occupation of the country .
germany claims it has already paid greece billions of euros in reparations .
german foreign ministry spokesman stefan bredohl said berlin and athens had had a " slight disagreement , " but that the german ambassador and the greek parliamentary speaker had recently had an " amicable " meeting .
the rehash of the decades-old war reparations dispute came as the german government announced a march 5 meeting in berlin between papandreou and german chancellor angela merkel .
greece may soon be in need of a government bailout , in which germany would likely play a central role , and which many germans strongly oppose .
speaking to parliament , papandreou said his government could not wait to address the deficit , and that he was optimistic the european union would lend its support .
" we are asking the eu for its solidarity and they are asking us to meet our obligations , " he said .
" we will meet our obligations ...
we will demand european community solidarity , and i believe we will get it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a focus cover sparked much controversy calls for boycott parallel to the spat over war reparations , the greek and german press have exchanged mocking words and images .
the latest issue of german news magazine focus featured an image of the venus de milo raising her middle finger on the cover .
a greek newspaper responded by printing an image of the statue atop the victory column in berlin holding a swastika .
the venus image led george lakouritis , president of greece 's oldest consumer group inka , to call on chancellor merkel to condemn the magazine .
the group also distributed leaflets in central athens and in front of the german-owned electronics store media markt calling for a boycott of german goods .
" the distortion of a statue of greek history , beauty and civilization , from a time when there -lrb- in germany -rrb- they were eating bananas on trees is impermissible and unforgivable , " the group said. acb / cmk / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a senior german official has dismissed the claims . a german member of the european parliament announced saturday that germany , france and the netherlands are planning to buy greek bonds to help athens cope with its debt crisis .
the claim , backed by a leading greek newspaper , was made by mep jorgo chatzimarkakis on greek television , despite reports that a senior german official , who declined to be named , had dismissed the comments as " nonsense . "
" germany is planning to buy 5-7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.8 - 9.5 billion -rrb- -lsb- of bonds -rsb- immediately , " said chatzimarkakis , a german of greek heritage .
he added that germany 's state-owned development bank kfw and france 's state-owned caisse des depots would contribute .
earlier , big german banks deutsche postbank , eurohypo and hypo real estate said they would not be buying any more greek government bonds .
athens plans to issue its second round of bonds this year , possibly in early march , in order to make good on debt payments due in april and may .
greece needs about 20 million euros to prevent a default , which could have potentially catastrophic effects on other eurozone economies .
the greek finance ministry and the european commission declined to comment on the report , and there was no immediate comment from france 's government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou has said greece will not seek world war ii reparations further tensions on friday , both germany and greece sought to downplay rising tensions as athens said it would not seek world war ii reparations from germany .
several government officials and opposition politicians have pressured prime minister george papandreou to renew demands that germany compensate greece for hitler 's occupation of the country .
germany claims it has already paid greece billions of euros in reparations .
german foreign ministry spokesman stefan bredohl said berlin and athens had had a " slight disagreement , " but that the german ambassador and the greek parliamentary speaker had recently had an " amicable " meeting .
the rehash of the decades-old war reparations dispute came as the german government announced a march 5 meeting in berlin between papandreou and german chancellor angela merkel .
greece may soon be in need of a government bailout , in which germany would likely play a central role , and which many germans strongly oppose .
speaking to parliament , papandreou said his government could not wait to address the deficit , and that he was optimistic the european union would lend its support .
" we are asking the eu for its solidarity and they are asking us to meet our obligations , " he said .
" we will meet our obligations ...
we will demand european community solidarity , and i believe we will get it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a focus cover sparked much controversy calls for boycott parallel to the spat over war reparations , the greek and german press have exchanged mocking words and images .
the latest issue of german news magazine focus featured an image of the venus de milo raising her middle finger on the cover .
a greek newspaper responded by printing an image of the statue atop the victory column in berlin holding a swastika .
the venus image led george lakouritis , president of greece 's oldest consumer group inka , to call on chancellor merkel to condemn the magazine .
the group also distributed leaflets in central athens and in front of the german-owned electronics store media markt calling for a boycott of german goods .
" the distortion of a statue of greek history , beauty and civilization , from a time when there -lrb- in germany -rrb- they were eating bananas on trees is impermissible and unforgivable , " the group said. acb / cmk / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meetings with the state premier had been offered for donations . germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- are facing renewed criticism after reports surfaced that personal meetings with another high-ranking party member were offered in exchange for cash .
cdu officials confirmed to german news magazine spiegel that the party had offered personal meetings with stanislaw tillich , cdu state premier of saxony , in exchange for party donations .
michael kretschmer , general secretary of the party , downplayed the practice .
" we 're selling event tickets , not the premier , " said kretschmer .
potential corporate sponsors of the cdu event denkfabrik sachsen , scheduled to take place on monday in dresden , reportedly had the option of sponsoring the party at four different price levels between 500 and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 680 and $ 10,900 -rrb- .
sponsors at the top two levels would have the option of a " short meeting " with tillich , according to the spiegel report .
sponsorship ' necessary ' kretschmer said the sponsorship was necessary to finance the event .
“ we 're expecting between 800 to 1,000 people on monday .
we 're not able to finance that ourselves from the few donations from our party members , ” he told regional public broadcaster mdr .
kretschmer stressed that the situation was nothing like the recent cdu scandal in north rhine-westphalia .
earlier in the week , reports surfaced that cdu officials in north rhine-westphalia had solicited as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,170 -rrb- for a personal conversation with juergen ruettgers , the premier of that state , and other high-ranking cdu leaders .
the meetings were to have taken place at a party convention in march .

michael kretschmer , general secretary of the party , downplayed the practice .

kretschmer stressed that the situation was nothing like the recent cdu scandal in north rhine-westphalia .

a senior german official has dismissed the claims . a german member of the european parliament announced saturday that germany , france and the netherlands are planning to buy greek bonds to help athens cope with its debt crisis .
the claim , backed by a leading greek newspaper , was made by mep jorgo chatzimarkakis on greek television , despite reports that a senior german official , who declined to be named , had dismissed the comments as " nonsense . "
" germany is planning to buy 5-7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.8 - 9.5 billion -rrb- -lsb- of bonds -rsb- immediately , " said chatzimarkakis , a german of greek heritage .
he added that germany 's state-owned development bank kfw and france 's state-owned caisse des depots would contribute .
earlier , big german banks deutsche postbank , eurohypo and hypo real estate said they would not be buying any more greek government bonds .
athens plans to issue its second round of bonds this year , possibly in early march , in order to make good on debt payments due in april and may .
greece needs about 20 million euros to prevent a default , which could have potentially catastrophic effects on other eurozone economies .
the greek finance ministry and the european commission declined to comment on the report , and there was no immediate comment from france 's government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou has said greece will not seek world war ii reparations further tensions on friday , both germany and greece sought to downplay rising tensions as athens said it would not seek world war ii reparations from germany .
several government officials and opposition politicians have pressured prime minister george papandreou to renew demands that germany compensate greece for hitler 's occupation of the country .
germany claims it has already paid greece billions of euros in reparations .
german foreign ministry spokesman stefan bredohl said berlin and athens had had a " slight disagreement , " but that the german ambassador and the greek parliamentary speaker had recently had an " amicable " meeting .
the rehash of the decades-old war reparations dispute came as the german government announced a march 5 meeting in berlin between papandreou and german chancellor angela merkel .
greece may soon be in need of a government bailout , in which germany would likely play a central role , and which many germans strongly oppose .
speaking to parliament , papandreou said his government could not wait to address the deficit , and that he was optimistic the european union would lend its support .
" we are asking the eu for its solidarity and they are asking us to meet our obligations , " he said .
" we will meet our obligations ...
we will demand european community solidarity , and i believe we will get it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a focus cover sparked much controversy calls for boycott parallel to the spat over war reparations , the greek and german press have exchanged mocking words and images .
the latest issue of german news magazine focus featured an image of the venus de milo raising her middle finger on the cover .
a greek newspaper responded by printing an image of the statue atop the victory column in berlin holding a swastika .
the venus image led george lakouritis , president of greece 's oldest consumer group inka , to call on chancellor merkel to condemn the magazine .
the group also distributed leaflets in central athens and in front of the german-owned electronics store media markt calling for a boycott of german goods .
" the distortion of a statue of greek history , beauty and civilization , from a time when there -lrb- in germany -rrb- they were eating bananas on trees is impermissible and unforgivable , " the group said. acb / cmk / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a senior german official has dismissed the claims . a german member of the european parliament announced saturday that germany , france and the netherlands are planning to buy greek bonds to help athens cope with its debt crisis .
the claim , backed by a leading greek newspaper , was made by mep jorgo chatzimarkakis on greek television , despite reports that a senior german official , who declined to be named , had dismissed the comments as " nonsense . "
" germany is planning to buy 5-7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.8 - 9.5 billion -rrb- -lsb- of bonds -rsb- immediately , " said chatzimarkakis , a german of greek heritage .
he added that germany 's state-owned development bank kfw and france 's state-owned caisse des depots would contribute .
earlier , big german banks deutsche postbank , eurohypo and hypo real estate said they would not be buying any more greek government bonds .
athens plans to issue its second round of bonds this year , possibly in early march , in order to make good on debt payments due in april and may .

"
the government council behind the handbook says it wants teachers to be better able to recognize homophobia - and to do something about it .
for many children and young adults , juvenile name-calling is a normal part of adolescence , but some believe it should be clearly put into context by teachers .
lucie otahalova , head of the government council for human rights , said the role of teachers should be to encourage discussion on homosexuality in an effort to combat discrimination .
" we want to give the handbook to these teachers , so they know what homophobia is , what types of students are the perpetrators , what types of students are the victims , and how to solve the problem , " she said .
according to otahalova , the decision to publish the handbook was partly motivated by surveys showing that up to 75 percent of male pupils in the czech republic had negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians .
a fact of life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urban areas are more accepting of same-sex couples students at the progressive , cosmopolitan londynska primary school in prague appeared to be more open-minded .
" we sometimes say , ' you are gay , ' but we do n't really mean it in the real meaning , " said one young boy .
" i do n't know any and i think they are a little bit funny , but they are only people so i do n't know why to discriminate against them . "
a young girl said she had nothing against homosexuality : " i like these people !
they 're only people , and i do n't have a problem with them . "
the deputy head of the londynska school , vaclav nadvornik , agreed that schools should accept homosexuality as a fact of life , adding that the government booklet would be of great benefit - unless the literature ends up filed away with every other publication the government sends out to schools .
" the way children are educated about -lrb- homosexual people -rrb- depends on the personality of the teacher , " he says .
" the government can do nothing about it . "

a senior german official has dismissed the claims . a german member of the european parliament announced saturday that germany , france and the netherlands are planning to buy greek bonds to help athens cope with its debt crisis .
the claim , backed by a leading greek newspaper , was made by mep jorgo chatzimarkakis on greek television , despite reports that a senior german official , who declined to be named , had dismissed the comments as " nonsense . "
" germany is planning to buy 5-7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.8 - 9.5 billion -rrb- -lsb- of bonds -rsb- immediately , " said chatzimarkakis , a german of greek heritage .
he added that germany 's state-owned development bank kfw and france 's state-owned caisse des depots would contribute .
earlier , big german banks deutsche postbank , eurohypo and hypo real estate said they would not be buying any more greek government bonds .
athens plans to issue its second round of bonds this year , possibly in early march , in order to make good on debt payments due in april and may .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 27.02.2010 russian state tv woos younger audiences großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian tv is typically a microphone for the government state-controlled television in russia usually tries to stay away from controversial topics .
but as younger viewers increasingly turn toward the internet , tv producers are doing their best to bring them back . channel one 's " mult lichnosti " is a case in point .
the show , whose name translates as " cartoon personalities " but is at the same time a play on the russian for " personality cult , " features satirical 3-d animations of international politicians and russian sports- and pop stars – a stark contrast from previously crude , propaganda-like news programs .
the show 's new year 's edition introduced cartoon figures of prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev , though they are treated lightly and with more respect compared to other international politicians .
even so , this is a minor revolution , according to the general director of channel one , konstantin ernst .
" in our country , there is just no cultural tradition of laughing at those in power , " he said .
" only someone like -lsb- soviet president -rsb- leonid brezhnev - who clung to power even though he was so old and sick he could n't stand straight anymore - was the butt of jokes . "
" but today 's leaders do everything in their power for russia , " he added .
no sign of press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satirization of medvedev and putin on television is uncommon in russia ernst said he did n't have to ask putin or medvedev for permission to portray them in the animated show .
but critics say editors and producers of state tv have gotten used to self-censorship to avoid offending authorities .
that 's why media expert alexeij muhim is skeptical about any changes state media makes to its programming .
" the new programs are definitely no sign of more press freedom , " he said .
" they are instruments to gain more influence on the audience .
the fact that channel one has introduced those information weapons has no relation to freedom of opinion at all . "
racy entertainment another example of new directions in state tv is the soap opera " shkola , " or " school . "
it follows the daily life of a fictional ninth-grade school class in a moscow suburb , where life is gloomy and tough .
the provocative material , which includes bullying , teenage sex and overworked and corrupt teachers , has led the russian parliament to debate the series .
prime minister putin claimed it " shows extreme cases , not an overall tendency , " and warned viewers from taking it too seriously .
but 27-year-old irina shirkova of moscow , who watches the soap regularly , is n't drawn to the show because she thinks it 's realistic .
she watches it , she says , because it 's entertaining .
" i actually never watched channel one – or tv at all , " she said .
" but ' shkola ' has a new and unusual approach .
it 's interesting that they are showing it – i had n't expected that from channel one at all . "

german magazine focus disclosed in early february that north rhine-westphalia state officials were negotiating a purchase of data on 1,500 german clients of swiss banks from a whistleblower in france , who reportedly asked for some 2.5 million euros -lrb- us $ 3.4 million -rrb- .
meanwhile , officials from the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg on friday said they would not buy the bank data , and that they would leave the decision up to the federal government .
chancellor angela merkel has voiced support for the sale , saying the benefit of recovering millions of euros in back-taxes outweighs the moral dilemma of paying for stolen information .
but the federal finance ministry said it would not buy the data , instead offering advice and assistance for states that would choose to go through with the purchase .
recovered money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is to meet his swiss counterpart next week germany requires its citizens to declare all their income worldwide , but an estimated 200 billion euros are hidden by germans in swiss bank accounts , known for their traditional privacy .
since the offer to sell the information first made headlines earlier this year , about 5,900 germans have turned themselves in for tax evasion , according to dieter ondracek , head of the german financial authorities ' trade union dstg .
ondracek said that could help the government recover 500 million euros of lost taxes .
" if we get a signal from the politicians that it 'll only be possible for people to come clean this year , then we could have another 5,000 doing so with corresponding additional revenues , " he told news agency reuters .
" then a billion euros could be possible . "
government meetings the tax data row has caused tension between the swiss and german governments .
switzerland has spoken against buying the data , saying the seller broke swiss law and should not be rewarded .
germany has expressed frustration with their southern neighbor 's secretive tax laws , which seem to invite germans to break their own laws and hide their income .
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is scheduled to host his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz in berlin on tuesday to discuss a new dual taxation agreement .
the swiss government also announced on thursday that it would no longer accept untaxed income in its banks. acb / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meetings with the state premier had been offered for donations . germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- are facing renewed criticism after reports surfaced that personal meetings with another high-ranking party member were offered in exchange for cash .
cdu officials confirmed to german news magazine spiegel that the party had offered personal meetings with stanislaw tillich , cdu state premier of saxony , in exchange for party donations .
michael kretschmer , general secretary of the party , downplayed the practice .
" we 're selling event tickets , not the premier , " said kretschmer .
potential corporate sponsors of the cdu event denkfabrik sachsen , scheduled to take place on monday in dresden , reportedly had the option of sponsoring the party at four different price levels between 500 and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 680 and $ 10,900 -rrb- .
sponsors at the top two levels would have the option of a " short meeting " with tillich , according to the spiegel report .

“ we 're expecting between 800 to 1,000 people on monday .
we 're not able to finance that ourselves from the few donations from our party members , ” he told regional public broadcaster mdr .
kretschmer stressed that the situation was nothing like the recent cdu scandal in north rhine-westphalia .
earlier in the week , reports surfaced that cdu officials in north rhine-westphalia had solicited as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,170 -rrb- for a personal conversation with juergen ruettgers , the premier of that state , and other high-ranking cdu leaders .
the meetings were to have taken place at a party convention in march .

meetings with the state premier had been offered for donations . germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- are facing renewed criticism after reports surfaced that personal meetings with another high-ranking party member were offered in exchange for cash .
cdu officials confirmed to german news magazine spiegel that the party had offered personal meetings with stanislaw tillich , cdu state premier of saxony , in exchange for party donations .
michael kretschmer , general secretary of the party , downplayed the practice .
" we 're selling event tickets , not the premier , " said kretschmer .
potential corporate sponsors of the cdu event denkfabrik sachsen , scheduled to take place on monday in dresden , reportedly had the option of sponsoring the party at four different price levels between 500 and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 680 and $ 10,900 -rrb- .
sponsors at the top two levels would have the option of a " short meeting " with tillich , according to the spiegel report .
sponsorship ' necessary ' kretschmer said the sponsorship was necessary to finance the event .
“ we 're expecting between 800 to 1,000 people on monday .
we 're not able to finance that ourselves from the few donations from our party members , ” he told regional public broadcaster mdr .
kretschmer stressed that the situation was nothing like the recent cdu scandal in north rhine-westphalia .
earlier in the week , reports surfaced that cdu officials in north rhine-westphalia had solicited as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,170 -rrb- for a personal conversation with juergen ruettgers , the premier of that state , and other high-ranking cdu leaders .
the meetings were to have taken place at a party convention in march .
in an attempt to divert attention from ruettgers , who is up for re-election in early may , the regional cdu 's general secretary hendrik wuest resigned on monday , assuming full responsibility for the affair. cmk / apn / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the government council behind the handbook says it wants teachers to be better able to recognize homophobia - and to do something about it .
for many children and young adults , juvenile name-calling is a normal part of adolescence , but some believe it should be clearly put into context by teachers .
lucie otahalova , head of the government council for human rights , said the role of teachers should be to encourage discussion on homosexuality in an effort to combat discrimination .
" we want to give the handbook to these teachers , so they know what homophobia is , what types of students are the perpetrators , what types of students are the victims , and how to solve the problem , " she said .
according to otahalova , the decision to publish the handbook was partly motivated by surveys showing that up to 75 percent of male pupils in the czech republic had negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians .

a senior german official has dismissed the claims . a german member of the european parliament announced saturday that germany , france and the netherlands are planning to buy greek bonds to help athens cope with its debt crisis .
the claim , backed by a leading greek newspaper , was made by mep jorgo chatzimarkakis on greek television , despite reports that a senior german official , who declined to be named , had dismissed the comments as " nonsense . "
" germany is planning to buy 5-7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.8 - 9.5 billion -rrb- -lsb- of bonds -rsb- immediately , " said chatzimarkakis , a german of greek heritage .
he added that germany 's state-owned development bank kfw and france 's state-owned caisse des depots would contribute .
earlier , big german banks deutsche postbank , eurohypo and hypo real estate said they would not be buying any more greek government bonds .
athens plans to issue its second round of bonds this year , possibly in early march , in order to make good on debt payments due in april and may .
greece needs about 20 million euros to prevent a default , which could have potentially catastrophic effects on other eurozone economies .
the greek finance ministry and the european commission declined to comment on the report , and there was no immediate comment from france 's government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou has said greece will not seek world war ii reparations further tensions on friday , both germany and greece sought to downplay rising tensions as athens said it would not seek world war ii reparations from germany .
several government officials and opposition politicians have pressured prime minister george papandreou to renew demands that germany compensate greece for hitler 's occupation of the country .
germany claims it has already paid greece billions of euros in reparations .
german foreign ministry spokesman stefan bredohl said berlin and athens had had a " slight disagreement , " but that the german ambassador and the greek parliamentary speaker had recently had an " amicable " meeting .
the rehash of the decades-old war reparations dispute came as the german government announced a march 5 meeting in berlin between papandreou and german chancellor angela merkel .
greece may soon be in need of a government bailout , in which germany would likely play a central role , and which many germans strongly oppose .
speaking to parliament , papandreou said his government could not wait to address the deficit , and that he was optimistic the european union would lend its support .
" we are asking the eu for its solidarity and they are asking us to meet our obligations , " he said .
" we will meet our obligations ...
we will demand european community solidarity , and i believe we will get it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a focus cover sparked much controversy calls for boycott parallel to the spat over war reparations , the greek and german press have exchanged mocking words and images .
the latest issue of german news magazine focus featured an image of the venus de milo raising her middle finger on the cover .
a greek newspaper responded by printing an image of the statue atop the victory column in berlin holding a swastika .
the venus image led george lakouritis , president of greece 's oldest consumer group inka , to call on chancellor merkel to condemn the magazine .
the group also distributed leaflets in central athens and in front of the german-owned electronics store media markt calling for a boycott of german goods .

a senior german official has dismissed the claims . a german member of the european parliament announced saturday that germany , france and the netherlands are planning to buy greek bonds to help athens cope with its debt crisis .
the claim , backed by a leading greek newspaper , was made by mep jorgo chatzimarkakis on greek television , despite reports that a senior german official , who declined to be named , had dismissed the comments as " nonsense . "
" germany is planning to buy 5-7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.8 - 9.5 billion -rrb- -lsb- of bonds -rsb- immediately , " said chatzimarkakis , a german of greek heritage .
he added that germany 's state-owned development bank kfw and france 's state-owned caisse des depots would contribute .
earlier , big german banks deutsche postbank , eurohypo and hypo real estate said they would not be buying any more greek government bonds .
athens plans to issue its second round of bonds this year , possibly in early march , in order to make good on debt payments due in april and may .
greece needs about 20 million euros to prevent a default , which could have potentially catastrophic effects on other eurozone economies .
the greek finance ministry and the european commission declined to comment on the report , and there was no immediate comment from france 's government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou has said greece will not seek world war ii reparations further tensions on friday , both germany and greece sought to downplay rising tensions as athens said it would not seek world war ii reparations from germany .
several government officials and opposition politicians have pressured prime minister george papandreou to renew demands that germany compensate greece for hitler 's occupation of the country .
germany claims it has already paid greece billions of euros in reparations .
german foreign ministry spokesman stefan bredohl said berlin and athens had had a " slight disagreement , " but that the german ambassador and the greek parliamentary speaker had recently had an " amicable " meeting .
the rehash of the decades-old war reparations dispute came as the german government announced a march 5 meeting in berlin between papandreou and german chancellor angela merkel .
greece may soon be in need of a government bailout , in which germany would likely play a central role , and which many germans strongly oppose .
speaking to parliament , papandreou said his government could not wait to address the deficit , and that he was optimistic the european union would lend its support .
" we are asking the eu for its solidarity and they are asking us to meet our obligations , " he said .
" we will meet our obligations ...
we will demand european community solidarity , and i believe we will get it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a focus cover sparked much controversy calls for boycott parallel to the spat over war reparations , the greek and german press have exchanged mocking words and images .
the latest issue of german news magazine focus featured an image of the venus de milo raising her middle finger on the cover .
a greek newspaper responded by printing an image of the statue atop the victory column in berlin holding a swastika .
the venus image led george lakouritis , president of greece 's oldest consumer group inka , to call on chancellor merkel to condemn the magazine .
the group also distributed leaflets in central athens and in front of the german-owned electronics store media markt calling for a boycott of german goods .
" the distortion of a statue of greek history , beauty and civilization , from a time when there -lrb- in germany -rrb- they were eating bananas on trees is impermissible and unforgivable , " the group said. acb / cmk / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the government council behind the handbook says it wants teachers to be better able to recognize homophobia - and to do something about it .
for many children and young adults , juvenile name-calling is a normal part of adolescence , but some believe it should be clearly put into context by teachers .
lucie otahalova , head of the government council for human rights , said the role of teachers should be to encourage discussion on homosexuality in an effort to combat discrimination .
" we want to give the handbook to these teachers , so they know what homophobia is , what types of students are the perpetrators , what types of students are the victims , and how to solve the problem , " she said .
according to otahalova , the decision to publish the handbook was partly motivated by surveys showing that up to 75 percent of male pupils in the czech republic had negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians .

" i do n't know any and i think they are a little bit funny , but they are only people so i do n't know why to discriminate against them . "
a young girl said she had nothing against homosexuality : " i like these people !
they 're only people , and i do n't have a problem with them . "
the deputy head of the londynska school , vaclav nadvornik , agreed that schools should accept homosexuality as a fact of life , adding that the government booklet would be of great benefit - unless the literature ends up filed away with every other publication the government sends out to schools .
" the way children are educated about -lrb- homosexual people -rrb- depends on the personality of the teacher , " he says .
" the government can do nothing about it . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 27.02.2010 piracy problems overshadow rising digital music sales großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of european music downloads are illegal piracy accounts for 95 percent of global music downloads .
as governments begin to change legislation , legal alternatives are growing fast .
but can this be enough to lure music fans back onto the straight and narrow ? the recently released ifpi -lrb- international federation of the phonographic industry -rrb- digital music report 2010 indicated that trade revenues are up 12 percent to an estimated us $ 4.2 billion in 2009 .
however , this figure masks a 10 percent overall decrease in music sales across the board .
“ the elephant in the room here is piracy , ” remarked alex jacob of the ifpi .
“ people are changing their habits but instead of going from buying a cd on the high street to buying a cd from a legal online store like amazon or itunes , they 're actually going to the illegal file-sharing networks and downloading music there ” , he continued .
illicit sharing accounts for around 95 percent of all worldwide music downloads . in the uk alone it is estimated that the music industry lost 250 million pounds to illegal downloads in 2009 .
local artists suffer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physical album sales have fallen dramatically across europe the ifpi report highlights the severe damage piracy is causing to local music industries around the world .
in particular , three countries known for the vibrant music scenes and influential artists - spain , france and brazil - are suffering acutely , with local artist album sales and release volumes plummeting .
spain , which has one of the highest rates of illegal file-sharing in europe , has seen sales by local artists in the top 50 fall by an estimated 65 percent between 2004 and 2009 . in brazil , full priced local album releases from the five largest music companies in 2008 were down 80 percent from their 2005 level .
reluctance to intervene internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- have little or no interest in curbing this illegal activity as they wish to comfort and entice customers with a promise of safety and freedom .
instead , governments are slowly beginning to intervene with legislation changes .
president sarkozy of france led the way in 2009 by introducing a ‘ graduated response ' approach to copyright infringement , whereby users are issued with warnings before any further action is taken .
“ if they continue eventually at the end of the line they get to a sanction which could be temporary account suspension ” , said jacob .
more countries are following suit , both taiwan and south korea have put new laws on the statute books and legislation is going through parliament in the uk and new zealand .
meanwhile a landmark ruling in italy at the beginning of february this year blocked italian access to the infamous bit torrent service ‘ the pirate bay ” – a site that facilitates access to a large amount of copyright infringing material .
“ it is vital these efforts are seen through to their conclusion and followed by other governments in 2010 , " said ifpi chairman and ceo john kennedy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french legislation is designed to push consumers towards legal downloads many however are dismayed at the prospect of such state intervention .
“ disconnecting someone 's broadband in this day and age is tantamount to throwing somebody outside of society entirely ” , says wendy grossman a member of the ‘ open rights group ' , a uk based digital rights organization .
“ for the questionable crime of downloading a music file it seems totally out of proportion to what the offence might be ” , she continued .
branching out the ifpi report also highlights how music companies are diversifying their revenue streams , offering new ways for consumers to buy and access music .
these include : subscription services ; music services bundled with devices and broadband subscriptions ; streaming services with applications for mobile devices ; advertising-supported services that offer premium services ; and online music video services .
in the last year 400 such services were licensed worldwide .
music companies have partnered with advertising-supported services such as spotify , deezer , myspace music and we7 ; isps such as tdc in denmark , terra in brazil and sky in the uk ; mobile operators such as vodafone ; handset makers such as nokia and sony ericsson ; and online video channels such as hulu and vevo .
spotify in particular has seen great success , attracting 7 million users in 6 different countries over the last 12 months .
but this is nowhere near enough to make a dent in the levels of piracy and illegal downloads worldwide .
lack of foresight critics of the big music labels like wendy grossman argue that the big record labels should have responded to the great popularity of the first music file-sharing site ‘ napster ' back in the early 2000s .
the original napster was shut down in 2001 by court order , but was an immediate hit during its three-year existence “ it should have become obvious to the music industry that the thing they should do is set up something similar that they controlled , if i were in the music industry i would be embarrassed by the fact that apple is the biggest retailer of digital music , what is this huge opportunity that these guys missed i do n't understand what they were thinking ! ” said grossman .
looking to the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have aggressive copyright protection efforts struck the wrong chord with consumers ?
tackling piracy lies in securing a joint effort between governments and isps according to the ipfi . this would also allow existing legal services to grow faster , says jacobs “ ultimately more choice will be offered to consumers because the amount of money that can be invested in new artists will start increasing again and that means there will be more choice , more diversity of genres for people to choose from – more chance of the band rehearsing in their garage today getting their break ” jacobs continued to stress that stamping out piracy all together was not on the ifpi 's agenda , “ we are not that naïve ” , he stressed , “ we do n't need in effect to stamp out piracy , but we can control it ” , he said .
wendy grossman however , remains skeptical about the effects of meddling with on-line freedom “ from the perspective of the people that the are prosecuting and chasing and berating , they have declared war on an entire generation of consumers and that is a very bad way to conduct a business because they are alienating their customers , and they are not only alienating their customers , they are alienating their best customers . ”
legal alternatives may be starting to win music industry battles , but for the foreseeable future at least the illegal download is winning the war .

the original napster was shut down in 2001 by court order , but was an immediate hit during its three-year existence “ it should have become obvious to the music industry that the thing they should do is set up something similar that they controlled , if i were in the music industry i would be embarrassed by the fact that apple is the biggest retailer of digital music , what is this huge opportunity that these guys missed i do n't understand what they were thinking ! ” said grossman .
looking to the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have aggressive copyright protection efforts struck the wrong chord with consumers ?
tackling piracy lies in securing a joint effort between governments and isps according to the ipfi . this would also allow existing legal services to grow faster , says jacobs “ ultimately more choice will be offered to consumers because the amount of money that can be invested in new artists will start increasing again and that means there will be more choice , more diversity of genres for people to choose from – more chance of the band rehearsing in their garage today getting their break ” jacobs continued to stress that stamping out piracy all together was not on the ifpi 's agenda , “ we are not that naïve ” , he stressed , “ we do n't need in effect to stamp out piracy , but we can control it ” , he said .
wendy grossman however , remains skeptical about the effects of meddling with on-line freedom “ from the perspective of the people that the are prosecuting and chasing and berating , they have declared war on an entire generation of consumers and that is a very bad way to conduct a business because they are alienating their customers , and they are not only alienating their customers , they are alienating their best customers . ”
legal alternatives may be starting to win music industry battles , but for the foreseeable future at least the illegal download is winning the war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 27.02.2010 russian state tv woos younger audiences großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian tv is typically a microphone for the government state-controlled television in russia usually tries to stay away from controversial topics .
but as younger viewers increasingly turn toward the internet , tv producers are doing their best to bring them back . channel one 's " mult lichnosti " is a case in point .
the show , whose name translates as " cartoon personalities " but is at the same time a play on the russian for " personality cult , " features satirical 3-d animations of international politicians and russian sports- and pop stars – a stark contrast from previously crude , propaganda-like news programs .
the show 's new year 's edition introduced cartoon figures of prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev , though they are treated lightly and with more respect compared to other international politicians .
even so , this is a minor revolution , according to the general director of channel one , konstantin ernst .
" in our country , there is just no cultural tradition of laughing at those in power , " he said .
" only someone like -lsb- soviet president -rsb- leonid brezhnev - who clung to power even though he was so old and sick he could n't stand straight anymore - was the butt of jokes . "
" but today 's leaders do everything in their power for russia , " he added .
no sign of press freedom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the satirization of medvedev and putin on television is uncommon in russia ernst said he did n't have to ask putin or medvedev for permission to portray them in the animated show .
but critics say editors and producers of state tv have gotten used to self-censorship to avoid offending authorities .
that 's why media expert alexeij muhim is skeptical about any changes state media makes to its programming .
" the new programs are definitely no sign of more press freedom , " he said .
" they are instruments to gain more influence on the audience .
the fact that channel one has introduced those information weapons has no relation to freedom of opinion at all . "
racy entertainment another example of new directions in state tv is the soap opera " shkola , " or " school . "
it follows the daily life of a fictional ninth-grade school class in a moscow suburb , where life is gloomy and tough .
the provocative material , which includes bullying , teenage sex and overworked and corrupt teachers , has led the russian parliament to debate the series .
prime minister putin claimed it " shows extreme cases , not an overall tendency , " and warned viewers from taking it too seriously .
but 27-year-old irina shirkova of moscow , who watches the soap regularly , is n't drawn to the show because she thinks it 's realistic .
she watches it , she says , because it 's entertaining .
" i actually never watched channel one – or tv at all , " she said .
" but ' shkola ' has a new and unusual approach .
it 's interesting that they are showing it – i had n't expected that from channel one at all . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 27.02.2010 piracy problems overshadow rising digital music sales großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of european music downloads are illegal piracy accounts for 95 percent of global music downloads .
as governments begin to change legislation , legal alternatives are growing fast .
but can this be enough to lure music fans back onto the straight and narrow ? the recently released ifpi -lrb- international federation of the phonographic industry -rrb- digital music report 2010 indicated that trade revenues are up 12 percent to an estimated us $ 4.2 billion in 2009 .
however , this figure masks a 10 percent overall decrease in music sales across the board .
“ the elephant in the room here is piracy , ” remarked alex jacob of the ifpi .
“ people are changing their habits but instead of going from buying a cd on the high street to buying a cd from a legal online store like amazon or itunes , they 're actually going to the illegal file-sharing networks and downloading music there ” , he continued .
illicit sharing accounts for around 95 percent of all worldwide music downloads . in the uk alone it is estimated that the music industry lost 250 million pounds to illegal downloads in 2009 .
local artists suffer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physical album sales have fallen dramatically across europe the ifpi report highlights the severe damage piracy is causing to local music industries around the world .
in particular , three countries known for the vibrant music scenes and influential artists - spain , france and brazil - are suffering acutely , with local artist album sales and release volumes plummeting .
spain , which has one of the highest rates of illegal file-sharing in europe , has seen sales by local artists in the top 50 fall by an estimated 65 percent between 2004 and 2009 . in brazil , full priced local album releases from the five largest music companies in 2008 were down 80 percent from their 2005 level .
reluctance to intervene internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- have little or no interest in curbing this illegal activity as they wish to comfort and entice customers with a promise of safety and freedom .
instead , governments are slowly beginning to intervene with legislation changes .
president sarkozy of france led the way in 2009 by introducing a ‘ graduated response ' approach to copyright infringement , whereby users are issued with warnings before any further action is taken .
“ if they continue eventually at the end of the line they get to a sanction which could be temporary account suspension ” , said jacob .
more countries are following suit , both taiwan and south korea have put new laws on the statute books and legislation is going through parliament in the uk and new zealand .
meanwhile a landmark ruling in italy at the beginning of february this year blocked italian access to the infamous bit torrent service ‘ the pirate bay ” – a site that facilitates access to a large amount of copyright infringing material .
“ it is vital these efforts are seen through to their conclusion and followed by other governments in 2010 , " said ifpi chairman and ceo john kennedy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french legislation is designed to push consumers towards legal downloads many however are dismayed at the prospect of such state intervention .
“ disconnecting someone 's broadband in this day and age is tantamount to throwing somebody outside of society entirely ” , says wendy grossman a member of the ‘ open rights group ' , a uk based digital rights organization .
“ for the questionable crime of downloading a music file it seems totally out of proportion to what the offence might be ” , she continued .
branching out the ifpi report also highlights how music companies are diversifying their revenue streams , offering new ways for consumers to buy and access music .
these include : subscription services ; music services bundled with devices and broadband subscriptions ; streaming services with applications for mobile devices ; advertising-supported services that offer premium services ; and online music video services .
in the last year 400 such services were licensed worldwide .
music companies have partnered with advertising-supported services such as spotify , deezer , myspace music and we7 ; isps such as tdc in denmark , terra in brazil and sky in the uk ; mobile operators such as vodafone ; handset makers such as nokia and sony ericsson ; and online video channels such as hulu and vevo .
spotify in particular has seen great success , attracting 7 million users in 6 different countries over the last 12 months .
but this is nowhere near enough to make a dent in the levels of piracy and illegal downloads worldwide .
lack of foresight critics of the big music labels like wendy grossman argue that the big record labels should have responded to the great popularity of the first music file-sharing site ‘ napster ' back in the early 2000s .

a senior german official has dismissed the claims . a german member of the european parliament announced saturday that germany , france and the netherlands are planning to buy greek bonds to help athens cope with its debt crisis .
the claim , backed by a leading greek newspaper , was made by mep jorgo chatzimarkakis on greek television , despite reports that a senior german official , who declined to be named , had dismissed the comments as " nonsense . "
" germany is planning to buy 5-7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.8 - 9.5 billion -rrb- -lsb- of bonds -rsb- immediately , " said chatzimarkakis , a german of greek heritage .
he added that germany 's state-owned development bank kfw and france 's state-owned caisse des depots would contribute .
earlier , big german banks deutsche postbank , eurohypo and hypo real estate said they would not be buying any more greek government bonds .
athens plans to issue its second round of bonds this year , possibly in early march , in order to make good on debt payments due in april and may .
greece needs about 20 million euros to prevent a default , which could have potentially catastrophic effects on other eurozone economies .
the greek finance ministry and the european commission declined to comment on the report , and there was no immediate comment from france 's government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou has said greece will not seek world war ii reparations further tensions on friday , both germany and greece sought to downplay rising tensions as athens said it would not seek world war ii reparations from germany .
several government officials and opposition politicians have pressured prime minister george papandreou to renew demands that germany compensate greece for hitler 's occupation of the country .
germany claims it has already paid greece billions of euros in reparations .
german foreign ministry spokesman stefan bredohl said berlin and athens had had a " slight disagreement , " but that the german ambassador and the greek parliamentary speaker had recently had an " amicable " meeting .
the rehash of the decades-old war reparations dispute came as the german government announced a march 5 meeting in berlin between papandreou and german chancellor angela merkel .
greece may soon be in need of a government bailout , in which germany would likely play a central role , and which many germans strongly oppose .
speaking to parliament , papandreou said his government could not wait to address the deficit , and that he was optimistic the european union would lend its support .
" we are asking the eu for its solidarity and they are asking us to meet our obligations , " he said .
" we will meet our obligations ...
we will demand european community solidarity , and i believe we will get it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a focus cover sparked much controversy calls for boycott parallel to the spat over war reparations , the greek and german press have exchanged mocking words and images .
the latest issue of german news magazine focus featured an image of the venus de milo raising her middle finger on the cover .
a greek newspaper responded by printing an image of the statue atop the victory column in berlin holding a swastika .
the venus image led george lakouritis , president of greece 's oldest consumer group inka , to call on chancellor merkel to condemn the magazine .
the group also distributed leaflets in central athens and in front of the german-owned electronics store media markt calling for a boycott of german goods .
" the distortion of a statue of greek history , beauty and civilization , from a time when there -lrb- in germany -rrb- they were eating bananas on trees is impermissible and unforgivable , " the group said. acb / cmk / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german magazine focus disclosed in early february that north rhine-westphalia state officials were negotiating a purchase of data on 1,500 german clients of swiss banks from a whistleblower in france , who reportedly asked for some 2.5 million euros -lrb- us $ 3.4 million -rrb- .
meanwhile , officials from the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg on friday said they would not buy the bank data , and that they would leave the decision up to the federal government .
chancellor angela merkel has voiced support for the sale , saying the benefit of recovering millions of euros in back-taxes outweighs the moral dilemma of paying for stolen information .
but the federal finance ministry said it would not buy the data , instead offering advice and assistance for states that would choose to go through with the purchase .
recovered money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is to meet his swiss counterpart next week germany requires its citizens to declare all their income worldwide , but an estimated 200 billion euros are hidden by germans in swiss bank accounts , known for their traditional privacy .
since the offer to sell the information first made headlines earlier this year , about 5,900 germans have turned themselves in for tax evasion , according to dieter ondracek , head of the german financial authorities ' trade union dstg .
ondracek said that could help the government recover 500 million euros of lost taxes .
" if we get a signal from the politicians that it 'll only be possible for people to come clean this year , then we could have another 5,000 doing so with corresponding additional revenues , " he told news agency reuters .
" then a billion euros could be possible . "
government meetings the tax data row has caused tension between the swiss and german governments .
switzerland has spoken against buying the data , saying the seller broke swiss law and should not be rewarded .
germany has expressed frustration with their southern neighbor 's secretive tax laws , which seem to invite germans to break their own laws and hide their income .
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is scheduled to host his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz in berlin on tuesday to discuss a new dual taxation agreement .
the swiss government also announced on thursday that it would no longer accept untaxed income in its banks. acb / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german magazine focus disclosed in early february that north rhine-westphalia state officials were negotiating a purchase of data on 1,500 german clients of swiss banks from a whistleblower in france , who reportedly asked for some 2.5 million euros -lrb- us $ 3.4 million -rrb- .
meanwhile , officials from the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg on friday said they would not buy the bank data , and that they would leave the decision up to the federal government .
chancellor angela merkel has voiced support for the sale , saying the benefit of recovering millions of euros in back-taxes outweighs the moral dilemma of paying for stolen information .
but the federal finance ministry said it would not buy the data , instead offering advice and assistance for states that would choose to go through with the purchase .
recovered money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is to meet his swiss counterpart next week germany requires its citizens to declare all their income worldwide , but an estimated 200 billion euros are hidden by germans in swiss bank accounts , known for their traditional privacy .
since the offer to sell the information first made headlines earlier this year , about 5,900 germans have turned themselves in for tax evasion , according to dieter ondracek , head of the german financial authorities ' trade union dstg .
ondracek said that could help the government recover 500 million euros of lost taxes .
" if we get a signal from the politicians that it 'll only be possible for people to come clean this year , then we could have another 5,000 doing so with corresponding additional revenues , " he told news agency reuters .
" then a billion euros could be possible . "
government meetings the tax data row has caused tension between the swiss and german governments .
switzerland has spoken against buying the data , saying the seller broke swiss law and should not be rewarded .
germany has expressed frustration with their southern neighbor 's secretive tax laws , which seem to invite germans to break their own laws and hide their income .
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is scheduled to host his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz in berlin on tuesday to discuss a new dual taxation agreement .
the swiss government also announced on thursday that it would no longer accept untaxed income in its banks. acb / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german magazine focus disclosed in early february that north rhine-westphalia state officials were negotiating a purchase of data on 1,500 german clients of swiss banks from a whistleblower in france , who reportedly asked for some 2.5 million euros -lrb- us $ 3.4 million -rrb- .
meanwhile , officials from the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg on friday said they would not buy the bank data , and that they would leave the decision up to the federal government .
chancellor angela merkel has voiced support for the sale , saying the benefit of recovering millions of euros in back-taxes outweighs the moral dilemma of paying for stolen information .
but the federal finance ministry said it would not buy the data , instead offering advice and assistance for states that would choose to go through with the purchase .
recovered money bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is to meet his swiss counterpart next week germany requires its citizens to declare all their income worldwide , but an estimated 200 billion euros are hidden by germans in swiss bank accounts , known for their traditional privacy .
since the offer to sell the information first made headlines earlier this year , about 5,900 germans have turned themselves in for tax evasion , according to dieter ondracek , head of the german financial authorities ' trade union dstg .
ondracek said that could help the government recover 500 million euros of lost taxes .
" if we get a signal from the politicians that it 'll only be possible for people to come clean this year , then we could have another 5,000 doing so with corresponding additional revenues , " he told news agency reuters .
" then a billion euros could be possible . "
government meetings the tax data row has caused tension between the swiss and german governments .
switzerland has spoken against buying the data , saying the seller broke swiss law and should not be rewarded .
germany has expressed frustration with their southern neighbor 's secretive tax laws , which seem to invite germans to break their own laws and hide their income .
german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is scheduled to host his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz in berlin on tuesday to discuss a new dual taxation agreement .
the swiss government also announced on thursday that it would no longer accept untaxed income in its banks. acb / dpa / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 27.02.2010 piracy problems overshadow rising digital music sales großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of european music downloads are illegal piracy accounts for 95 percent of global music downloads .
as governments begin to change legislation , legal alternatives are growing fast .
but can this be enough to lure music fans back onto the straight and narrow ? the recently released ifpi -lrb- international federation of the phonographic industry -rrb- digital music report 2010 indicated that trade revenues are up 12 percent to an estimated us $ 4.2 billion in 2009 .
however , this figure masks a 10 percent overall decrease in music sales across the board .
“ the elephant in the room here is piracy , ” remarked alex jacob of the ifpi .
“ people are changing their habits but instead of going from buying a cd on the high street to buying a cd from a legal online store like amazon or itunes , they 're actually going to the illegal file-sharing networks and downloading music there ” , he continued .
illicit sharing accounts for around 95 percent of all worldwide music downloads . in the uk alone it is estimated that the music industry lost 250 million pounds to illegal downloads in 2009 .
local artists suffer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physical album sales have fallen dramatically across europe the ifpi report highlights the severe damage piracy is causing to local music industries around the world .
in particular , three countries known for the vibrant music scenes and influential artists - spain , france and brazil - are suffering acutely , with local artist album sales and release volumes plummeting .
spain , which has one of the highest rates of illegal file-sharing in europe , has seen sales by local artists in the top 50 fall by an estimated 65 percent between 2004 and 2009 . in brazil , full priced local album releases from the five largest music companies in 2008 were down 80 percent from their 2005 level .
reluctance to intervene internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- have little or no interest in curbing this illegal activity as they wish to comfort and entice customers with a promise of safety and freedom .
instead , governments are slowly beginning to intervene with legislation changes .
president sarkozy of france led the way in 2009 by introducing a ‘ graduated response ' approach to copyright infringement , whereby users are issued with warnings before any further action is taken .
“ if they continue eventually at the end of the line they get to a sanction which could be temporary account suspension ” , said jacob .
more countries are following suit , both taiwan and south korea have put new laws on the statute books and legislation is going through parliament in the uk and new zealand .
meanwhile a landmark ruling in italy at the beginning of february this year blocked italian access to the infamous bit torrent service ‘ the pirate bay ” – a site that facilitates access to a large amount of copyright infringing material .
“ it is vital these efforts are seen through to their conclusion and followed by other governments in 2010 , " said ifpi chairman and ceo john kennedy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french legislation is designed to push consumers towards legal downloads many however are dismayed at the prospect of such state intervention .
“ disconnecting someone 's broadband in this day and age is tantamount to throwing somebody outside of society entirely ” , says wendy grossman a member of the ‘ open rights group ' , a uk based digital rights organization .
“ for the questionable crime of downloading a music file it seems totally out of proportion to what the offence might be ” , she continued .
branching out the ifpi report also highlights how music companies are diversifying their revenue streams , offering new ways for consumers to buy and access music .
these include : subscription services ; music services bundled with devices and broadband subscriptions ; streaming services with applications for mobile devices ; advertising-supported services that offer premium services ; and online music video services .
in the last year 400 such services were licensed worldwide .
music companies have partnered with advertising-supported services such as spotify , deezer , myspace music and we7 ; isps such as tdc in denmark , terra in brazil and sky in the uk ; mobile operators such as vodafone ; handset makers such as nokia and sony ericsson ; and online video channels such as hulu and vevo .
spotify in particular has seen great success , attracting 7 million users in 6 different countries over the last 12 months .
but this is nowhere near enough to make a dent in the levels of piracy and illegal downloads worldwide .
lack of foresight critics of the big music labels like wendy grossman argue that the big record labels should have responded to the great popularity of the first music file-sharing site ‘ napster ' back in the early 2000s .
the original napster was shut down in 2001 by court order , but was an immediate hit during its three-year existence “ it should have become obvious to the music industry that the thing they should do is set up something similar that they controlled , if i were in the music industry i would be embarrassed by the fact that apple is the biggest retailer of digital music , what is this huge opportunity that these guys missed i do n't understand what they were thinking ! ” said grossman .
looking to the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have aggressive copyright protection efforts struck the wrong chord with consumers ?
tackling piracy lies in securing a joint effort between governments and isps according to the ipfi . this would also allow existing legal services to grow faster , says jacobs “ ultimately more choice will be offered to consumers because the amount of money that can be invested in new artists will start increasing again and that means there will be more choice , more diversity of genres for people to choose from – more chance of the band rehearsing in their garage today getting their break ” jacobs continued to stress that stamping out piracy all together was not on the ifpi 's agenda , “ we are not that naïve ” , he stressed , “ we do n't need in effect to stamp out piracy , but we can control it ” , he said .
wendy grossman however , remains skeptical about the effects of meddling with on-line freedom “ from the perspective of the people that the are prosecuting and chasing and berating , they have declared war on an entire generation of consumers and that is a very bad way to conduct a business because they are alienating their customers , and they are not only alienating their customers , they are alienating their best customers . ”
legal alternatives may be starting to win music industry battles , but for the foreseeable future at least the illegal download is winning the war .

"
the government council behind the handbook says it wants teachers to be better able to recognize homophobia - and to do something about it .
for many children and young adults , juvenile name-calling is a normal part of adolescence , but some believe it should be clearly put into context by teachers .
lucie otahalova , head of the government council for human rights , said the role of teachers should be to encourage discussion on homosexuality in an effort to combat discrimination .
" we want to give the handbook to these teachers , so they know what homophobia is , what types of students are the perpetrators , what types of students are the victims , and how to solve the problem , " she said .
according to otahalova , the decision to publish the handbook was partly motivated by surveys showing that up to 75 percent of male pupils in the czech republic had negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians .

" i do n't know any and i think they are a little bit funny , but they are only people so i do n't know why to discriminate against them . "
a young girl said she had nothing against homosexuality : " i like these people !
they 're only people , and i do n't have a problem with them . "
the deputy head of the londynska school , vaclav nadvornik , agreed that schools should accept homosexuality as a fact of life , adding that the government booklet would be of great benefit - unless the literature ends up filed away with every other publication the government sends out to schools .
" the way children are educated about -lrb- homosexual people -rrb- depends on the personality of the teacher , " he says .
" the government can do nothing about it . "

branching out the ifpi report also highlights how music companies are diversifying their revenue streams , offering new ways for consumers to buy and access music .
these include : subscription services ; music services bundled with devices and broadband subscriptions ; streaming services with applications for mobile devices ; advertising-supported services that offer premium services ; and online music video services .
in the last year 400 such services were licensed worldwide .
music companies have partnered with advertising-supported services such as spotify , deezer , myspace music and we7 ; isps such as tdc in denmark , terra in brazil and sky in the uk ; mobile operators such as vodafone ; handset makers such as nokia and sony ericsson ; and online video channels such as hulu and vevo .
spotify in particular has seen great success , attracting 7 million users in 6 different countries over the last 12 months .
but this is nowhere near enough to make a dent in the levels of piracy and illegal downloads worldwide .
lack of foresight critics of the big music labels like wendy grossman argue that the big record labels should have responded to the great popularity of the first music file-sharing site ‘ napster ' back in the early 2000s .
the original napster was shut down in 2001 by court order , but was an immediate hit during its three-year existence “ it should have become obvious to the music industry that the thing they should do is set up something similar that they controlled , if i were in the music industry i would be embarrassed by the fact that apple is the biggest retailer of digital music , what is this huge opportunity that these guys missed i do n't understand what they were thinking ! ” said grossman .
looking to the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have aggressive copyright protection efforts struck the wrong chord with consumers ?
tackling piracy lies in securing a joint effort between governments and isps according to the ipfi . this would also allow existing legal services to grow faster , says jacobs “ ultimately more choice will be offered to consumers because the amount of money that can be invested in new artists will start increasing again and that means there will be more choice , more diversity of genres for people to choose from – more chance of the band rehearsing in their garage today getting their break ” jacobs continued to stress that stamping out piracy all together was not on the ifpi 's agenda , “ we are not that naïve ” , he stressed , “ we do n't need in effect to stamp out piracy , but we can control it ” , he said .
wendy grossman however , remains skeptical about the effects of meddling with on-line freedom “ from the perspective of the people that the are prosecuting and chasing and berating , they have declared war on an entire generation of consumers and that is a very bad way to conduct a business because they are alienating their customers , and they are not only alienating their customers , they are alienating their best customers . ”
legal alternatives may be starting to win music industry battles , but for the foreseeable future at least the illegal download is winning the war .

as governments begin to change legislation , legal alternatives are growing fast .
but can this be enough to lure music fans back onto the straight and narrow ? the recently released ifpi -lrb- international federation of the phonographic industry -rrb- digital music report 2010 indicated that trade revenues are up 12 percent to an estimated us $ 4.2 billion in 2009 .
however , this figure masks a 10 percent overall decrease in music sales across the board .
“ the elephant in the room here is piracy , ” remarked alex jacob of the ifpi .
“ people are changing their habits but instead of going from buying a cd on the high street to buying a cd from a legal online store like amazon or itunes , they 're actually going to the illegal file-sharing networks and downloading music there ” , he continued .
illicit sharing accounts for around 95 percent of all worldwide music downloads . in the uk alone it is estimated that the music industry lost 250 million pounds to illegal downloads in 2009 .
local artists suffer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physical album sales have fallen dramatically across europe the ifpi report highlights the severe damage piracy is causing to local music industries around the world .
in particular , three countries known for the vibrant music scenes and influential artists - spain , france and brazil - are suffering acutely , with local artist album sales and release volumes plummeting .
spain , which has one of the highest rates of illegal file-sharing in europe , has seen sales by local artists in the top 50 fall by an estimated 65 percent between 2004 and 2009 . in brazil , full priced local album releases from the five largest music companies in 2008 were down 80 percent from their 2005 level .
reluctance to intervene internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- have little or no interest in curbing this illegal activity as they wish to comfort and entice customers with a promise of safety and freedom .
instead , governments are slowly beginning to intervene with legislation changes .
president sarkozy of france led the way in 2009 by introducing a ‘ graduated response ' approach to copyright infringement , whereby users are issued with warnings before any further action is taken .
“ if they continue eventually at the end of the line they get to a sanction which could be temporary account suspension ” , said jacob .
more countries are following suit , both taiwan and south korea have put new laws on the statute books and legislation is going through parliament in the uk and new zealand .
meanwhile a landmark ruling in italy at the beginning of february this year blocked italian access to the infamous bit torrent service ‘ the pirate bay ” – a site that facilitates access to a large amount of copyright infringing material .
“ it is vital these efforts are seen through to their conclusion and followed by other governments in 2010 , " said ifpi chairman and ceo john kennedy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french legislation is designed to push consumers towards legal downloads many however are dismayed at the prospect of such state intervention .

as governments begin to change legislation , legal alternatives are growing fast .
but can this be enough to lure music fans back onto the straight and narrow ? the recently released ifpi -lrb- international federation of the phonographic industry -rrb- digital music report 2010 indicated that trade revenues are up 12 percent to an estimated us $ 4.2 billion in 2009 .
however , this figure masks a 10 percent overall decrease in music sales across the board .
“ the elephant in the room here is piracy , ” remarked alex jacob of the ifpi .
“ people are changing their habits but instead of going from buying a cd on the high street to buying a cd from a legal online store like amazon or itunes , they 're actually going to the illegal file-sharing networks and downloading music there ” , he continued .
illicit sharing accounts for around 95 percent of all worldwide music downloads . in the uk alone it is estimated that the music industry lost 250 million pounds to illegal downloads in 2009 .
local artists suffer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physical album sales have fallen dramatically across europe the ifpi report highlights the severe damage piracy is causing to local music industries around the world .
in particular , three countries known for the vibrant music scenes and influential artists - spain , france and brazil - are suffering acutely , with local artist album sales and release volumes plummeting .
spain , which has one of the highest rates of illegal file-sharing in europe , has seen sales by local artists in the top 50 fall by an estimated 65 percent between 2004 and 2009 . in brazil , full priced local album releases from the five largest music companies in 2008 were down 80 percent from their 2005 level .
reluctance to intervene internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- have little or no interest in curbing this illegal activity as they wish to comfort and entice customers with a promise of safety and freedom .
instead , governments are slowly beginning to intervene with legislation changes .
president sarkozy of france led the way in 2009 by introducing a ‘ graduated response ' approach to copyright infringement , whereby users are issued with warnings before any further action is taken .
“ if they continue eventually at the end of the line they get to a sanction which could be temporary account suspension ” , said jacob .
more countries are following suit , both taiwan and south korea have put new laws on the statute books and legislation is going through parliament in the uk and new zealand .
meanwhile a landmark ruling in italy at the beginning of february this year blocked italian access to the infamous bit torrent service ‘ the pirate bay ” – a site that facilitates access to a large amount of copyright infringing material .
“ it is vital these efforts are seen through to their conclusion and followed by other governments in 2010 , " said ifpi chairman and ceo john kennedy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french legislation is designed to push consumers towards legal downloads many however are dismayed at the prospect of such state intervention .
“ disconnecting someone 's broadband in this day and age is tantamount to throwing somebody outside of society entirely ” , says wendy grossman a member of the ‘ open rights group ' , a uk based digital rights organization .
“ for the questionable crime of downloading a music file it seems totally out of proportion to what the offence might be ” , she continued .
branching out the ifpi report also highlights how music companies are diversifying their revenue streams , offering new ways for consumers to buy and access music .
these include : subscription services ; music services bundled with devices and broadband subscriptions ; streaming services with applications for mobile devices ; advertising-supported services that offer premium services ; and online music video services .
in the last year 400 such services were licensed worldwide .
music companies have partnered with advertising-supported services such as spotify , deezer , myspace music and we7 ; isps such as tdc in denmark , terra in brazil and sky in the uk ; mobile operators such as vodafone ; handset makers such as nokia and sony ericsson ; and online video channels such as hulu and vevo .
spotify in particular has seen great success , attracting 7 million users in 6 different countries over the last 12 months .
but this is nowhere near enough to make a dent in the levels of piracy and illegal downloads worldwide .
lack of foresight critics of the big music labels like wendy grossman argue that the big record labels should have responded to the great popularity of the first music file-sharing site ‘ napster ' back in the early 2000s .
the original napster was shut down in 2001 by court order , but was an immediate hit during its three-year existence “ it should have become obvious to the music industry that the thing they should do is set up something similar that they controlled , if i were in the music industry i would be embarrassed by the fact that apple is the biggest retailer of digital music , what is this huge opportunity that these guys missed i do n't understand what they were thinking ! ” said grossman .
looking to the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have aggressive copyright protection efforts struck the wrong chord with consumers ?
tackling piracy lies in securing a joint effort between governments and isps according to the ipfi . this would also allow existing legal services to grow faster , says jacobs “ ultimately more choice will be offered to consumers because the amount of money that can be invested in new artists will start increasing again and that means there will be more choice , more diversity of genres for people to choose from – more chance of the band rehearsing in their garage today getting their break ” jacobs continued to stress that stamping out piracy all together was not on the ifpi 's agenda , “ we are not that naïve ” , he stressed , “ we do n't need in effect to stamp out piracy , but we can control it ” , he said .
wendy grossman however , remains skeptical about the effects of meddling with on-line freedom “ from the perspective of the people that the are prosecuting and chasing and berating , they have declared war on an entire generation of consumers and that is a very bad way to conduct a business because they are alienating their customers , and they are not only alienating their customers , they are alienating their best customers . ”
legal alternatives may be starting to win music industry battles , but for the foreseeable future at least the illegal download is winning the war .

however , this figure masks a 10 percent overall decrease in music sales across the board .
“ the elephant in the room here is piracy , ” remarked alex jacob of the ifpi .
“ people are changing their habits but instead of going from buying a cd on the high street to buying a cd from a legal online store like amazon or itunes , they 're actually going to the illegal file-sharing networks and downloading music there ” , he continued .
illicit sharing accounts for around 95 percent of all worldwide music downloads . in the uk alone it is estimated that the music industry lost 250 million pounds to illegal downloads in 2009 .
local artists suffer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physical album sales have fallen dramatically across europe the ifpi report highlights the severe damage piracy is causing to local music industries around the world .
in particular , three countries known for the vibrant music scenes and influential artists - spain , france and brazil - are suffering acutely , with local artist album sales and release volumes plummeting .
spain , which has one of the highest rates of illegal file-sharing in europe , has seen sales by local artists in the top 50 fall by an estimated 65 percent between 2004 and 2009 . in brazil , full priced local album releases from the five largest music companies in 2008 were down 80 percent from their 2005 level .
reluctance to intervene internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- have little or no interest in curbing this illegal activity as they wish to comfort and entice customers with a promise of safety and freedom .
instead , governments are slowly beginning to intervene with legislation changes .
president sarkozy of france led the way in 2009 by introducing a ‘ graduated response ' approach to copyright infringement , whereby users are issued with warnings before any further action is taken .
“ if they continue eventually at the end of the line they get to a sanction which could be temporary account suspension ” , said jacob .
more countries are following suit , both taiwan and south korea have put new laws on the statute books and legislation is going through parliament in the uk and new zealand .
meanwhile a landmark ruling in italy at the beginning of february this year blocked italian access to the infamous bit torrent service ‘ the pirate bay ” – a site that facilitates access to a large amount of copyright infringing material .
“ it is vital these efforts are seen through to their conclusion and followed by other governments in 2010 , " said ifpi chairman and ceo john kennedy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french legislation is designed to push consumers towards legal downloads many however are dismayed at the prospect of such state intervention .
“ disconnecting someone 's broadband in this day and age is tantamount to throwing somebody outside of society entirely ” , says wendy grossman a member of the ‘ open rights group ' , a uk based digital rights organization .
“ for the questionable crime of downloading a music file it seems totally out of proportion to what the offence might be ” , she continued .
branching out the ifpi report also highlights how music companies are diversifying their revenue streams , offering new ways for consumers to buy and access music .
these include : subscription services ; music services bundled with devices and broadband subscriptions ; streaming services with applications for mobile devices ; advertising-supported services that offer premium services ; and online music video services .
in the last year 400 such services were licensed worldwide .
music companies have partnered with advertising-supported services such as spotify , deezer , myspace music and we7 ; isps such as tdc in denmark , terra in brazil and sky in the uk ; mobile operators such as vodafone ; handset makers such as nokia and sony ericsson ; and online video channels such as hulu and vevo .
spotify in particular has seen great success , attracting 7 million users in 6 different countries over the last 12 months .
but this is nowhere near enough to make a dent in the levels of piracy and illegal downloads worldwide .
lack of foresight critics of the big music labels like wendy grossman argue that the big record labels should have responded to the great popularity of the first music file-sharing site ‘ napster ' back in the early 2000s .
the original napster was shut down in 2001 by court order , but was an immediate hit during its three-year existence “ it should have become obvious to the music industry that the thing they should do is set up something similar that they controlled , if i were in the music industry i would be embarrassed by the fact that apple is the biggest retailer of digital music , what is this huge opportunity that these guys missed i do n't understand what they were thinking ! ” said grossman .
looking to the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have aggressive copyright protection efforts struck the wrong chord with consumers ?
tackling piracy lies in securing a joint effort between governments and isps according to the ipfi . this would also allow existing legal services to grow faster , says jacobs “ ultimately more choice will be offered to consumers because the amount of money that can be invested in new artists will start increasing again and that means there will be more choice , more diversity of genres for people to choose from – more chance of the band rehearsing in their garage today getting their break ” jacobs continued to stress that stamping out piracy all together was not on the ifpi 's agenda , “ we are not that naïve ” , he stressed , “ we do n't need in effect to stamp out piracy , but we can control it ” , he said .
wendy grossman however , remains skeptical about the effects of meddling with on-line freedom “ from the perspective of the people that the are prosecuting and chasing and berating , they have declared war on an entire generation of consumers and that is a very bad way to conduct a business because they are alienating their customers , and they are not only alienating their customers , they are alienating their best customers . ”
legal alternatives may be starting to win music industry battles , but for the foreseeable future at least the illegal download is winning the war .

"
the government council behind the handbook says it wants teachers to be better able to recognize homophobia - and to do something about it .
for many children and young adults , juvenile name-calling is a normal part of adolescence , but some believe it should be clearly put into context by teachers .
lucie otahalova , head of the government council for human rights , said the role of teachers should be to encourage discussion on homosexuality in an effort to combat discrimination .
" we want to give the handbook to these teachers , so they know what homophobia is , what types of students are the perpetrators , what types of students are the victims , and how to solve the problem , " she said .
according to otahalova , the decision to publish the handbook was partly motivated by surveys showing that up to 75 percent of male pupils in the czech republic had negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians .

" i do n't know any and i think they are a little bit funny , but they are only people so i do n't know why to discriminate against them . "
a young girl said she had nothing against homosexuality : " i like these people !
they 're only people , and i do n't have a problem with them . "
the deputy head of the londynska school , vaclav nadvornik , agreed that schools should accept homosexuality as a fact of life , adding that the government booklet would be of great benefit - unless the literature ends up filed away with every other publication the government sends out to schools .
" the way children are educated about -lrb- homosexual people -rrb- depends on the personality of the teacher , " he says .
" the government can do nothing about it . "

"
the government council behind the handbook says it wants teachers to be better able to recognize homophobia - and to do something about it .
for many children and young adults , juvenile name-calling is a normal part of adolescence , but some believe it should be clearly put into context by teachers .
lucie otahalova , head of the government council for human rights , said the role of teachers should be to encourage discussion on homosexuality in an effort to combat discrimination .
" we want to give the handbook to these teachers , so they know what homophobia is , what types of students are the perpetrators , what types of students are the victims , and how to solve the problem , " she said .
according to otahalova , the decision to publish the handbook was partly motivated by surveys showing that up to 75 percent of male pupils in the czech republic had negative attitudes towards gays and lesbians .

a young girl said she had nothing against homosexuality : " i like these people !
they 're only people , and i do n't have a problem with them . "
the deputy head of the londynska school , vaclav nadvornik , agreed that schools should accept homosexuality as a fact of life , adding that the government booklet would be of great benefit - unless the literature ends up filed away with every other publication the government sends out to schools .
" the way children are educated about -lrb- homosexual people -rrb- depends on the personality of the teacher , " he says .

meanwhile , officials from the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg on friday said they would not buy the bank data , and that they would leave the decision up to the federal government .

" if we get a signal from the politicians that it 'll only be possible for people to come clean this year , then we could have another 5,000 doing so with corresponding additional revenues , " he told news agency reuters .
" then a billion euros could be possible . "

switzerland has spoken against buying the data , saying the seller broke swiss law and should not be rewarded .

german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble is scheduled to host his swiss counterpart hans-rudolf merz in berlin on tuesday to discuss a new dual taxation agreement .

several government officials and opposition politicians have pressured prime minister george papandreou to renew demands that germany compensate greece for hitler 's occupation of the country .
germany claims it has already paid greece billions of euros in reparations .
german foreign ministry spokesman stefan bredohl said berlin and athens had had a " slight disagreement , " but that the german ambassador and the greek parliamentary speaker had recently had an " amicable " meeting .
the rehash of the decades-old war reparations dispute came as the german government announced a march 5 meeting in berlin between papandreou and german chancellor angela merkel .
greece may soon be in need of a government bailout , in which germany would likely play a central role , and which many germans strongly oppose .
speaking to parliament , papandreou said his government could not wait to address the deficit , and that he was optimistic the european union would lend its support .
" we are asking the eu for its solidarity and they are asking us to meet our obligations , " he said .
" we will meet our obligations ...
we will demand european community solidarity , and i believe we will get it . "

a senior german official has dismissed the claims . a german member of the european parliament announced saturday that germany , france and the netherlands are planning to buy greek bonds to help athens cope with its debt crisis .
the claim , backed by a leading greek newspaper , was made by mep jorgo chatzimarkakis on greek television , despite reports that a senior german official , who declined to be named , had dismissed the comments as " nonsense . "
" germany is planning to buy 5-7 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.8 - 9.5 billion -rrb- -lsb- of bonds -rsb- immediately , " said chatzimarkakis , a german of greek heritage .
he added that germany 's state-owned development bank kfw and france 's state-owned caisse des depots would contribute .
earlier , big german banks deutsche postbank , eurohypo and hypo real estate said they would not be buying any more greek government bonds .
athens plans to issue its second round of bonds this year , possibly in early march , in order to make good on debt payments due in april and may .
greece needs about 20 million euros to prevent a default , which could have potentially catastrophic effects on other eurozone economies .
the greek finance ministry and the european commission declined to comment on the report , and there was no immediate comment from france 's government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou has said greece will not seek world war ii reparations further tensions on friday , both germany and greece sought to downplay rising tensions as athens said it would not seek world war ii reparations from germany .
several government officials and opposition politicians have pressured prime minister george papandreou to renew demands that germany compensate greece for hitler 's occupation of the country .
germany claims it has already paid greece billions of euros in reparations .
german foreign ministry spokesman stefan bredohl said berlin and athens had had a " slight disagreement , " but that the german ambassador and the greek parliamentary speaker had recently had an " amicable " meeting .
the rehash of the decades-old war reparations dispute came as the german government announced a march 5 meeting in berlin between papandreou and german chancellor angela merkel .
greece may soon be in need of a government bailout , in which germany would likely play a central role , and which many germans strongly oppose .
speaking to parliament , papandreou said his government could not wait to address the deficit , and that he was optimistic the european union would lend its support .
" we are asking the eu for its solidarity and they are asking us to meet our obligations , " he said .
" we will meet our obligations ...
we will demand european community solidarity , and i believe we will get it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a focus cover sparked much controversy calls for boycott parallel to the spat over war reparations , the greek and german press have exchanged mocking words and images .
the latest issue of german news magazine focus featured an image of the venus de milo raising her middle finger on the cover .
a greek newspaper responded by printing an image of the statue atop the victory column in berlin holding a swastika .
the venus image led george lakouritis , president of greece 's oldest consumer group inka , to call on chancellor merkel to condemn the magazine .
the group also distributed leaflets in central athens and in front of the german-owned electronics store media markt calling for a boycott of german goods .
" the distortion of a statue of greek history , beauty and civilization , from a time when there -lrb- in germany -rrb- they were eating bananas on trees is impermissible and unforgivable , " the group said. acb / cmk / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meetings with the state premier had been offered for donations . germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- are facing renewed criticism after reports surfaced that personal meetings with another high-ranking party member were offered in exchange for cash .
cdu officials confirmed to german news magazine spiegel that the party had offered personal meetings with stanislaw tillich , cdu state premier of saxony , in exchange for party donations .
michael kretschmer , general secretary of the party , downplayed the practice .
" we 're selling event tickets , not the premier , " said kretschmer .
potential corporate sponsors of the cdu event denkfabrik sachsen , scheduled to take place on monday in dresden , reportedly had the option of sponsoring the party at four different price levels between 500 and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 680 and $ 10,900 -rrb- .
sponsors at the top two levels would have the option of a " short meeting " with tillich , according to the spiegel report .

“ we 're expecting between 800 to 1,000 people on monday .
we 're not able to finance that ourselves from the few donations from our party members , ” he told regional public broadcaster mdr .
kretschmer stressed that the situation was nothing like the recent cdu scandal in north rhine-westphalia .
earlier in the week , reports surfaced that cdu officials in north rhine-westphalia had solicited as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,170 -rrb- for a personal conversation with juergen ruettgers , the premier of that state , and other high-ranking cdu leaders .
the meetings were to have taken place at a party convention in march .

meetings with the state premier had been offered for donations . germany 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- are facing renewed criticism after reports surfaced that personal meetings with another high-ranking party member were offered in exchange for cash .
cdu officials confirmed to german news magazine spiegel that the party had offered personal meetings with stanislaw tillich , cdu state premier of saxony , in exchange for party donations .
michael kretschmer , general secretary of the party , downplayed the practice .
" we 're selling event tickets , not the premier , " said kretschmer .
potential corporate sponsors of the cdu event denkfabrik sachsen , scheduled to take place on monday in dresden , reportedly had the option of sponsoring the party at four different price levels between 500 and 8,000 euros -lrb- $ 680 and $ 10,900 -rrb- .
sponsors at the top two levels would have the option of a " short meeting " with tillich , according to the spiegel report .
sponsorship ' necessary ' kretschmer said the sponsorship was necessary to finance the event .
“ we 're expecting between 800 to 1,000 people on monday .
we 're not able to finance that ourselves from the few donations from our party members , ” he told regional public broadcaster mdr .
kretschmer stressed that the situation was nothing like the recent cdu scandal in north rhine-westphalia .
earlier in the week , reports surfaced that cdu officials in north rhine-westphalia had solicited as much as 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 8,170 -rrb- for a personal conversation with juergen ruettgers , the premier of that state , and other high-ranking cdu leaders .
the meetings were to have taken place at a party convention in march .
in an attempt to divert attention from ruettgers , who is up for re-election in early may , the regional cdu 's general secretary hendrik wuest resigned on monday , assuming full responsibility for the affair. cmk / apn / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 27.02.2010 piracy problems overshadow rising digital music sales großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of european music downloads are illegal piracy accounts for 95 percent of global music downloads .
as governments begin to change legislation , legal alternatives are growing fast .
but can this be enough to lure music fans back onto the straight and narrow ? the recently released ifpi -lrb- international federation of the phonographic industry -rrb- digital music report 2010 indicated that trade revenues are up 12 percent to an estimated us $ 4.2 billion in 2009 .
however , this figure masks a 10 percent overall decrease in music sales across the board .
“ the elephant in the room here is piracy , ” remarked alex jacob of the ifpi .
“ people are changing their habits but instead of going from buying a cd on the high street to buying a cd from a legal online store like amazon or itunes , they 're actually going to the illegal file-sharing networks and downloading music there ” , he continued .
illicit sharing accounts for around 95 percent of all worldwide music downloads . in the uk alone it is estimated that the music industry lost 250 million pounds to illegal downloads in 2009 .
local artists suffer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physical album sales have fallen dramatically across europe the ifpi report highlights the severe damage piracy is causing to local music industries around the world .
in particular , three countries known for the vibrant music scenes and influential artists - spain , france and brazil - are suffering acutely , with local artist album sales and release volumes plummeting .
spain , which has one of the highest rates of illegal file-sharing in europe , has seen sales by local artists in the top 50 fall by an estimated 65 percent between 2004 and 2009 . in brazil , full priced local album releases from the five largest music companies in 2008 were down 80 percent from their 2005 level .
reluctance to intervene internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- have little or no interest in curbing this illegal activity as they wish to comfort and entice customers with a promise of safety and freedom .
instead , governments are slowly beginning to intervene with legislation changes .
president sarkozy of france led the way in 2009 by introducing a ‘ graduated response ' approach to copyright infringement , whereby users are issued with warnings before any further action is taken .
“ if they continue eventually at the end of the line they get to a sanction which could be temporary account suspension ” , said jacob .
more countries are following suit , both taiwan and south korea have put new laws on the statute books and legislation is going through parliament in the uk and new zealand .
meanwhile a landmark ruling in italy at the beginning of february this year blocked italian access to the infamous bit torrent service ‘ the pirate bay ” – a site that facilitates access to a large amount of copyright infringing material .
“ it is vital these efforts are seen through to their conclusion and followed by other governments in 2010 , " said ifpi chairman and ceo john kennedy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french legislation is designed to push consumers towards legal downloads many however are dismayed at the prospect of such state intervention .
“ disconnecting someone 's broadband in this day and age is tantamount to throwing somebody outside of society entirely ” , says wendy grossman a member of the ‘ open rights group ' , a uk based digital rights organization .
“ for the questionable crime of downloading a music file it seems totally out of proportion to what the offence might be ” , she continued .
branching out the ifpi report also highlights how music companies are diversifying their revenue streams , offering new ways for consumers to buy and access music .
these include : subscription services ; music services bundled with devices and broadband subscriptions ; streaming services with applications for mobile devices ; advertising-supported services that offer premium services ; and online music video services .
in the last year 400 such services were licensed worldwide .
music companies have partnered with advertising-supported services such as spotify , deezer , myspace music and we7 ; isps such as tdc in denmark , terra in brazil and sky in the uk ; mobile operators such as vodafone ; handset makers such as nokia and sony ericsson ; and online video channels such as hulu and vevo .
spotify in particular has seen great success , attracting 7 million users in 6 different countries over the last 12 months .
but this is nowhere near enough to make a dent in the levels of piracy and illegal downloads worldwide .
lack of foresight critics of the big music labels like wendy grossman argue that the big record labels should have responded to the great popularity of the first music file-sharing site ‘ napster ' back in the early 2000s .
the original napster was shut down in 2001 by court order , but was an immediate hit during its three-year existence “ it should have become obvious to the music industry that the thing they should do is set up something similar that they controlled , if i were in the music industry i would be embarrassed by the fact that apple is the biggest retailer of digital music , what is this huge opportunity that these guys missed i do n't understand what they were thinking ! ” said grossman .
looking to the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have aggressive copyright protection efforts struck the wrong chord with consumers ?
tackling piracy lies in securing a joint effort between governments and isps according to the ipfi . this would also allow existing legal services to grow faster , says jacobs “ ultimately more choice will be offered to consumers because the amount of money that can be invested in new artists will start increasing again and that means there will be more choice , more diversity of genres for people to choose from – more chance of the band rehearsing in their garage today getting their break ” jacobs continued to stress that stamping out piracy all together was not on the ifpi 's agenda , “ we are not that naïve ” , he stressed , “ we do n't need in effect to stamp out piracy , but we can control it ” , he said .
wendy grossman however , remains skeptical about the effects of meddling with on-line freedom “ from the perspective of the people that the are prosecuting and chasing and berating , they have declared war on an entire generation of consumers and that is a very bad way to conduct a business because they are alienating their customers , and they are not only alienating their customers , they are alienating their best customers . ”
legal alternatives may be starting to win music industry battles , but for the foreseeable future at least the illegal download is winning the war .

as governments begin to change legislation , legal alternatives are growing fast .
but can this be enough to lure music fans back onto the straight and narrow ? the recently released ifpi -lrb- international federation of the phonographic industry -rrb- digital music report 2010 indicated that trade revenues are up 12 percent to an estimated us $ 4.2 billion in 2009 .
however , this figure masks a 10 percent overall decrease in music sales across the board .
“ the elephant in the room here is piracy , ” remarked alex jacob of the ifpi .
“ people are changing their habits but instead of going from buying a cd on the high street to buying a cd from a legal online store like amazon or itunes , they 're actually going to the illegal file-sharing networks and downloading music there ” , he continued .
illicit sharing accounts for around 95 percent of all worldwide music downloads . in the uk alone it is estimated that the music industry lost 250 million pounds to illegal downloads in 2009 .
local artists suffer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physical album sales have fallen dramatically across europe the ifpi report highlights the severe damage piracy is causing to local music industries around the world .
in particular , three countries known for the vibrant music scenes and influential artists - spain , france and brazil - are suffering acutely , with local artist album sales and release volumes plummeting .
spain , which has one of the highest rates of illegal file-sharing in europe , has seen sales by local artists in the top 50 fall by an estimated 65 percent between 2004 and 2009 . in brazil , full priced local album releases from the five largest music companies in 2008 were down 80 percent from their 2005 level .
reluctance to intervene internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- have little or no interest in curbing this illegal activity as they wish to comfort and entice customers with a promise of safety and freedom .
instead , governments are slowly beginning to intervene with legislation changes .
president sarkozy of france led the way in 2009 by introducing a ‘ graduated response ' approach to copyright infringement , whereby users are issued with warnings before any further action is taken .
“ if they continue eventually at the end of the line they get to a sanction which could be temporary account suspension ” , said jacob .
more countries are following suit , both taiwan and south korea have put new laws on the statute books and legislation is going through parliament in the uk and new zealand .
meanwhile a landmark ruling in italy at the beginning of february this year blocked italian access to the infamous bit torrent service ‘ the pirate bay ” – a site that facilitates access to a large amount of copyright infringing material .
“ it is vital these efforts are seen through to their conclusion and followed by other governments in 2010 , " said ifpi chairman and ceo john kennedy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french legislation is designed to push consumers towards legal downloads many however are dismayed at the prospect of such state intervention .
“ disconnecting someone 's broadband in this day and age is tantamount to throwing somebody outside of society entirely ” , says wendy grossman a member of the ‘ open rights group ' , a uk based digital rights organization .
“ for the questionable crime of downloading a music file it seems totally out of proportion to what the offence might be ” , she continued .
branching out the ifpi report also highlights how music companies are diversifying their revenue streams , offering new ways for consumers to buy and access music .
these include : subscription services ; music services bundled with devices and broadband subscriptions ; streaming services with applications for mobile devices ; advertising-supported services that offer premium services ; and online music video services .
in the last year 400 such services were licensed worldwide .
music companies have partnered with advertising-supported services such as spotify , deezer , myspace music and we7 ; isps such as tdc in denmark , terra in brazil and sky in the uk ; mobile operators such as vodafone ; handset makers such as nokia and sony ericsson ; and online video channels such as hulu and vevo .
spotify in particular has seen great success , attracting 7 million users in 6 different countries over the last 12 months .
but this is nowhere near enough to make a dent in the levels of piracy and illegal downloads worldwide .
lack of foresight critics of the big music labels like wendy grossman argue that the big record labels should have responded to the great popularity of the first music file-sharing site ‘ napster ' back in the early 2000s .
the original napster was shut down in 2001 by court order , but was an immediate hit during its three-year existence “ it should have become obvious to the music industry that the thing they should do is set up something similar that they controlled , if i were in the music industry i would be embarrassed by the fact that apple is the biggest retailer of digital music , what is this huge opportunity that these guys missed i do n't understand what they were thinking ! ” said grossman .
looking to the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have aggressive copyright protection efforts struck the wrong chord with consumers ?
tackling piracy lies in securing a joint effort between governments and isps according to the ipfi . this would also allow existing legal services to grow faster , says jacobs “ ultimately more choice will be offered to consumers because the amount of money that can be invested in new artists will start increasing again and that means there will be more choice , more diversity of genres for people to choose from – more chance of the band rehearsing in their garage today getting their break ” jacobs continued to stress that stamping out piracy all together was not on the ifpi 's agenda , “ we are not that naïve ” , he stressed , “ we do n't need in effect to stamp out piracy , but we can control it ” , he said .
wendy grossman however , remains skeptical about the effects of meddling with on-line freedom “ from the perspective of the people that the are prosecuting and chasing and berating , they have declared war on an entire generation of consumers and that is a very bad way to conduct a business because they are alienating their customers , and they are not only alienating their customers , they are alienating their best customers . ”
legal alternatives may be starting to win music industry battles , but for the foreseeable future at least the illegal download is winning the war .

“ disconnecting someone 's broadband in this day and age is tantamount to throwing somebody outside of society entirely ” , says wendy grossman a member of the ‘ open rights group ' , a uk based digital rights organization .
“ for the questionable crime of downloading a music file it seems totally out of proportion to what the offence might be ” , she continued .
branching out the ifpi report also highlights how music companies are diversifying their revenue streams , offering new ways for consumers to buy and access music .
these include : subscription services ; music services bundled with devices and broadband subscriptions ; streaming services with applications for mobile devices ; advertising-supported services that offer premium services ; and online music video services .
in the last year 400 such services were licensed worldwide .
music companies have partnered with advertising-supported services such as spotify , deezer , myspace music and we7 ; isps such as tdc in denmark , terra in brazil and sky in the uk ; mobile operators such as vodafone ; handset makers such as nokia and sony ericsson ; and online video channels such as hulu and vevo .
spotify in particular has seen great success , attracting 7 million users in 6 different countries over the last 12 months .
but this is nowhere near enough to make a dent in the levels of piracy and illegal downloads worldwide .
lack of foresight critics of the big music labels like wendy grossman argue that the big record labels should have responded to the great popularity of the first music file-sharing site ‘ napster ' back in the early 2000s .
the original napster was shut down in 2001 by court order , but was an immediate hit during its three-year existence “ it should have become obvious to the music industry that the thing they should do is set up something similar that they controlled , if i were in the music industry i would be embarrassed by the fact that apple is the biggest retailer of digital music , what is this huge opportunity that these guys missed i do n't understand what they were thinking ! ” said grossman .
looking to the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have aggressive copyright protection efforts struck the wrong chord with consumers ?
tackling piracy lies in securing a joint effort between governments and isps according to the ipfi . this would also allow existing legal services to grow faster , says jacobs “ ultimately more choice will be offered to consumers because the amount of money that can be invested in new artists will start increasing again and that means there will be more choice , more diversity of genres for people to choose from – more chance of the band rehearsing in their garage today getting their break ” jacobs continued to stress that stamping out piracy all together was not on the ifpi 's agenda , “ we are not that naïve ” , he stressed , “ we do n't need in effect to stamp out piracy , but we can control it ” , he said .
wendy grossman however , remains skeptical about the effects of meddling with on-line freedom “ from the perspective of the people that the are prosecuting and chasing and berating , they have declared war on an entire generation of consumers and that is a very bad way to conduct a business because they are alienating their customers , and they are not only alienating their customers , they are alienating their best customers . ”
legal alternatives may be starting to win music industry battles , but for the foreseeable future at least the illegal download is winning the war .

as governments begin to change legislation , legal alternatives are growing fast .
but can this be enough to lure music fans back onto the straight and narrow ? the recently released ifpi -lrb- international federation of the phonographic industry -rrb- digital music report 2010 indicated that trade revenues are up 12 percent to an estimated us $ 4.2 billion in 2009 .
however , this figure masks a 10 percent overall decrease in music sales across the board .
“ the elephant in the room here is piracy , ” remarked alex jacob of the ifpi .
“ people are changing their habits but instead of going from buying a cd on the high street to buying a cd from a legal online store like amazon or itunes , they 're actually going to the illegal file-sharing networks and downloading music there ” , he continued .
illicit sharing accounts for around 95 percent of all worldwide music downloads . in the uk alone it is estimated that the music industry lost 250 million pounds to illegal downloads in 2009 .
local artists suffer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physical album sales have fallen dramatically across europe the ifpi report highlights the severe damage piracy is causing to local music industries around the world .
in particular , three countries known for the vibrant music scenes and influential artists - spain , france and brazil - are suffering acutely , with local artist album sales and release volumes plummeting .
spain , which has one of the highest rates of illegal file-sharing in europe , has seen sales by local artists in the top 50 fall by an estimated 65 percent between 2004 and 2009 . in brazil , full priced local album releases from the five largest music companies in 2008 were down 80 percent from their 2005 level .
reluctance to intervene internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- have little or no interest in curbing this illegal activity as they wish to comfort and entice customers with a promise of safety and freedom .
instead , governments are slowly beginning to intervene with legislation changes .
president sarkozy of france led the way in 2009 by introducing a ‘ graduated response ' approach to copyright infringement , whereby users are issued with warnings before any further action is taken .
“ if they continue eventually at the end of the line they get to a sanction which could be temporary account suspension ” , said jacob .

as part of an ambitious theater project in germany 's ruhr region , audience members undertake an odyssey of their own as they are guided through six cities in two days . the theater project " odyssey europa " was masterminded not by stage directors , but by architects : matthias rick and the collective raumlabourberlin .
the event premieres on february 27-28 as part of the 2010 european capital of culture program in the ruhr region and is repeated on march 6-7 , march 13-14 , april 2-3 , and may 22-23 . deutsche welle : matthias rick , you are , literally , the architect of odyssey europa .
what does that mean ?
what role does your architectural collective play in this ambitious theater project ? matthias rick : six authors from different countries have been invited to present their own contemporary interpretations of homer 's odyssey .
the pieces they have written will be performed in six different theaters in six different cities across the ruhr region .
raumlabor have been invited to create the trip between the theater pieces - the " odyssey , " in fact . what is the " odyssey " ?
what will happen to the audience when they arrive ? you will arrive saturday morning in front of the first theater .
you will have to " check in " - because you are crossing a border - and then you are inside this project .
you will see the first piece . hospitality is a central idea in " odyssey , " so we have invited the citizens of the area to act as hosts .
after the first piece , a host will greet you and take you to the next theater .
this will be a local person who will take you in his car , on the subway or whatever .
it 's entirely his or her decision . bildunterschrift : in addition to the journey , audiences view six theater productions in various cities in the ruhr region the project takes place over two days .
how does this work in practice ? on the first day you will see performances in three cities : essen , oberhausen and bochum .
then comes the night , which you will be invited to spend in your host 's home .
then we have the second day in muellheim , moers and dortmund .
the transport in between the cities will vary according to the preference of your host .
it could be cars , boats , buses , metros … everyone knows that odysseus was trying to get home .
in a sprawling industrial metropolis made up of 53 separate cities , where is home ? that 's a good question .
it is the question " odyssey " is asking : where is home ?
how do you find home ?
it 's the main theme of the theater pieces and it 's also a question which has been very important to us in creating the tour .
we call this trip " an odyssey through the world in-between . " i think one of the characteristics of this region is this world between the cities : empty spaces .
we have islands - the theater pieces are the islands and our journey is like shipping between these islands . it 's a very special concept .
perhaps that 's why they asked an architect ! interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what does that mean ?
what role does your architectural collective play in this ambitious theater project ? matthias rick : six authors from different countries have been invited to present their own contemporary interpretations of homer 's odyssey .
the pieces they have written will be performed in six different theaters in six different cities across the ruhr region .
raumlabor have been invited to create the trip between the theater pieces - the " odyssey , " in fact . what is the " odyssey " ?
what will happen to the audience when they arrive ? you will arrive saturday morning in front of the first theater .
you will have to " check in " - because you are crossing a border - and then you are inside this project .
you will see the first piece . hospitality is a central idea in " odyssey , " so we have invited the citizens of the area to act as hosts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 27.02.2010 piracy problems overshadow rising digital music sales großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of european music downloads are illegal piracy accounts for 95 percent of global music downloads .
as governments begin to change legislation , legal alternatives are growing fast .
but can this be enough to lure music fans back onto the straight and narrow ? the recently released ifpi -lrb- international federation of the phonographic industry -rrb- digital music report 2010 indicated that trade revenues are up 12 percent to an estimated us $ 4.2 billion in 2009 .
however , this figure masks a 10 percent overall decrease in music sales across the board .
“ the elephant in the room here is piracy , ” remarked alex jacob of the ifpi .
“ people are changing their habits but instead of going from buying a cd on the high street to buying a cd from a legal online store like amazon or itunes , they 're actually going to the illegal file-sharing networks and downloading music there ” , he continued .
illicit sharing accounts for around 95 percent of all worldwide music downloads . in the uk alone it is estimated that the music industry lost 250 million pounds to illegal downloads in 2009 .
local artists suffer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physical album sales have fallen dramatically across europe the ifpi report highlights the severe damage piracy is causing to local music industries around the world .
in particular , three countries known for the vibrant music scenes and influential artists - spain , france and brazil - are suffering acutely , with local artist album sales and release volumes plummeting .
spain , which has one of the highest rates of illegal file-sharing in europe , has seen sales by local artists in the top 50 fall by an estimated 65 percent between 2004 and 2009 . in brazil , full priced local album releases from the five largest music companies in 2008 were down 80 percent from their 2005 level .
reluctance to intervene internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- have little or no interest in curbing this illegal activity as they wish to comfort and entice customers with a promise of safety and freedom .
instead , governments are slowly beginning to intervene with legislation changes .
president sarkozy of france led the way in 2009 by introducing a ‘ graduated response ' approach to copyright infringement , whereby users are issued with warnings before any further action is taken .
“ if they continue eventually at the end of the line they get to a sanction which could be temporary account suspension ” , said jacob .
more countries are following suit , both taiwan and south korea have put new laws on the statute books and legislation is going through parliament in the uk and new zealand .
meanwhile a landmark ruling in italy at the beginning of february this year blocked italian access to the infamous bit torrent service ‘ the pirate bay ” – a site that facilitates access to a large amount of copyright infringing material .
“ it is vital these efforts are seen through to their conclusion and followed by other governments in 2010 , " said ifpi chairman and ceo john kennedy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french legislation is designed to push consumers towards legal downloads many however are dismayed at the prospect of such state intervention .
“ disconnecting someone 's broadband in this day and age is tantamount to throwing somebody outside of society entirely ” , says wendy grossman a member of the ‘ open rights group ' , a uk based digital rights organization .
“ for the questionable crime of downloading a music file it seems totally out of proportion to what the offence might be ” , she continued .
branching out the ifpi report also highlights how music companies are diversifying their revenue streams , offering new ways for consumers to buy and access music .
these include : subscription services ; music services bundled with devices and broadband subscriptions ; streaming services with applications for mobile devices ; advertising-supported services that offer premium services ; and online music video services .
in the last year 400 such services were licensed worldwide .
music companies have partnered with advertising-supported services such as spotify , deezer , myspace music and we7 ; isps such as tdc in denmark , terra in brazil and sky in the uk ; mobile operators such as vodafone ; handset makers such as nokia and sony ericsson ; and online video channels such as hulu and vevo .
spotify in particular has seen great success , attracting 7 million users in 6 different countries over the last 12 months .
but this is nowhere near enough to make a dent in the levels of piracy and illegal downloads worldwide .
lack of foresight critics of the big music labels like wendy grossman argue that the big record labels should have responded to the great popularity of the first music file-sharing site ‘ napster ' back in the early 2000s .
the original napster was shut down in 2001 by court order , but was an immediate hit during its three-year existence “ it should have become obvious to the music industry that the thing they should do is set up something similar that they controlled , if i were in the music industry i would be embarrassed by the fact that apple is the biggest retailer of digital music , what is this huge opportunity that these guys missed i do n't understand what they were thinking ! ” said grossman .
looking to the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have aggressive copyright protection efforts struck the wrong chord with consumers ?
tackling piracy lies in securing a joint effort between governments and isps according to the ipfi . this would also allow existing legal services to grow faster , says jacobs “ ultimately more choice will be offered to consumers because the amount of money that can be invested in new artists will start increasing again and that means there will be more choice , more diversity of genres for people to choose from – more chance of the band rehearsing in their garage today getting their break ” jacobs continued to stress that stamping out piracy all together was not on the ifpi 's agenda , “ we are not that naïve ” , he stressed , “ we do n't need in effect to stamp out piracy , but we can control it ” , he said .
wendy grossman however , remains skeptical about the effects of meddling with on-line freedom “ from the perspective of the people that the are prosecuting and chasing and berating , they have declared war on an entire generation of consumers and that is a very bad way to conduct a business because they are alienating their customers , and they are not only alienating their customers , they are alienating their best customers . ”
legal alternatives may be starting to win music industry battles , but for the foreseeable future at least the illegal download is winning the war .

as governments begin to change legislation , legal alternatives are growing fast .
but can this be enough to lure music fans back onto the straight and narrow ? the recently released ifpi -lrb- international federation of the phonographic industry -rrb- digital music report 2010 indicated that trade revenues are up 12 percent to an estimated us $ 4.2 billion in 2009 .
however , this figure masks a 10 percent overall decrease in music sales across the board .
“ the elephant in the room here is piracy , ” remarked alex jacob of the ifpi .
“ people are changing their habits but instead of going from buying a cd on the high street to buying a cd from a legal online store like amazon or itunes , they 're actually going to the illegal file-sharing networks and downloading music there ” , he continued .
illicit sharing accounts for around 95 percent of all worldwide music downloads . in the uk alone it is estimated that the music industry lost 250 million pounds to illegal downloads in 2009 .
local artists suffer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physical album sales have fallen dramatically across europe the ifpi report highlights the severe damage piracy is causing to local music industries around the world .
in particular , three countries known for the vibrant music scenes and influential artists - spain , france and brazil - are suffering acutely , with local artist album sales and release volumes plummeting .
spain , which has one of the highest rates of illegal file-sharing in europe , has seen sales by local artists in the top 50 fall by an estimated 65 percent between 2004 and 2009 . in brazil , full priced local album releases from the five largest music companies in 2008 were down 80 percent from their 2005 level .
reluctance to intervene internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- have little or no interest in curbing this illegal activity as they wish to comfort and entice customers with a promise of safety and freedom .
instead , governments are slowly beginning to intervene with legislation changes .
president sarkozy of france led the way in 2009 by introducing a ‘ graduated response ' approach to copyright infringement , whereby users are issued with warnings before any further action is taken .
“ if they continue eventually at the end of the line they get to a sanction which could be temporary account suspension ” , said jacob .
more countries are following suit , both taiwan and south korea have put new laws on the statute books and legislation is going through parliament in the uk and new zealand .
meanwhile a landmark ruling in italy at the beginning of february this year blocked italian access to the infamous bit torrent service ‘ the pirate bay ” – a site that facilitates access to a large amount of copyright infringing material .
“ it is vital these efforts are seen through to their conclusion and followed by other governments in 2010 , " said ifpi chairman and ceo john kennedy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french legislation is designed to push consumers towards legal downloads many however are dismayed at the prospect of such state intervention .
“ disconnecting someone 's broadband in this day and age is tantamount to throwing somebody outside of society entirely ” , says wendy grossman a member of the ‘ open rights group ' , a uk based digital rights organization .
“ for the questionable crime of downloading a music file it seems totally out of proportion to what the offence might be ” , she continued .
branching out the ifpi report also highlights how music companies are diversifying their revenue streams , offering new ways for consumers to buy and access music .
these include : subscription services ; music services bundled with devices and broadband subscriptions ; streaming services with applications for mobile devices ; advertising-supported services that offer premium services ; and online music video services .
in the last year 400 such services were licensed worldwide .
music companies have partnered with advertising-supported services such as spotify , deezer , myspace music and we7 ; isps such as tdc in denmark , terra in brazil and sky in the uk ; mobile operators such as vodafone ; handset makers such as nokia and sony ericsson ; and online video channels such as hulu and vevo .
spotify in particular has seen great success , attracting 7 million users in 6 different countries over the last 12 months .
but this is nowhere near enough to make a dent in the levels of piracy and illegal downloads worldwide .
lack of foresight critics of the big music labels like wendy grossman argue that the big record labels should have responded to the great popularity of the first music file-sharing site ‘ napster ' back in the early 2000s .
the original napster was shut down in 2001 by court order , but was an immediate hit during its three-year existence “ it should have become obvious to the music industry that the thing they should do is set up something similar that they controlled , if i were in the music industry i would be embarrassed by the fact that apple is the biggest retailer of digital music , what is this huge opportunity that these guys missed i do n't understand what they were thinking ! ” said grossman .
looking to the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have aggressive copyright protection efforts struck the wrong chord with consumers ?
tackling piracy lies in securing a joint effort between governments and isps according to the ipfi . this would also allow existing legal services to grow faster , says jacobs “ ultimately more choice will be offered to consumers because the amount of money that can be invested in new artists will start increasing again and that means there will be more choice , more diversity of genres for people to choose from – more chance of the band rehearsing in their garage today getting their break ” jacobs continued to stress that stamping out piracy all together was not on the ifpi 's agenda , “ we are not that naïve ” , he stressed , “ we do n't need in effect to stamp out piracy , but we can control it ” , he said .
wendy grossman however , remains skeptical about the effects of meddling with on-line freedom “ from the perspective of the people that the are prosecuting and chasing and berating , they have declared war on an entire generation of consumers and that is a very bad way to conduct a business because they are alienating their customers , and they are not only alienating their customers , they are alienating their best customers . ”
legal alternatives may be starting to win music industry battles , but for the foreseeable future at least the illegal download is winning the war .

as part of an ambitious theater project in germany 's ruhr region , audience members undertake an odyssey of their own as they are guided through six cities in two days . the theater project " odyssey europa " was masterminded not by stage directors , but by architects : matthias rick and the collective raumlabourberlin .
the event premieres on february 27-28 as part of the 2010 european capital of culture program in the ruhr region and is repeated on march 6-7 , march 13-14 , april 2-3 , and may 22-23 . deutsche welle : matthias rick , you are , literally , the architect of odyssey europa .
what does that mean ?
what role does your architectural collective play in this ambitious theater project ? matthias rick : six authors from different countries have been invited to present their own contemporary interpretations of homer 's odyssey .
the pieces they have written will be performed in six different theaters in six different cities across the ruhr region .
raumlabor have been invited to create the trip between the theater pieces - the " odyssey , " in fact . what is the " odyssey " ?
what will happen to the audience when they arrive ? you will arrive saturday morning in front of the first theater .
you will have to " check in " - because you are crossing a border - and then you are inside this project .
you will see the first piece . hospitality is a central idea in " odyssey , " so we have invited the citizens of the area to act as hosts .
after the first piece , a host will greet you and take you to the next theater .
this will be a local person who will take you in his car , on the subway or whatever .
it 's entirely his or her decision . bildunterschrift : in addition to the journey , audiences view six theater productions in various cities in the ruhr region the project takes place over two days .
how does this work in practice ? on the first day you will see performances in three cities : essen , oberhausen and bochum .
then comes the night , which you will be invited to spend in your host 's home .
then we have the second day in muellheim , moers and dortmund .
the transport in between the cities will vary according to the preference of your host .
it could be cars , boats , buses , metros … everyone knows that odysseus was trying to get home .
in a sprawling industrial metropolis made up of 53 separate cities , where is home ? that 's a good question .
it is the question " odyssey " is asking : where is home ?
how do you find home ?
it 's the main theme of the theater pieces and it 's also a question which has been very important to us in creating the tour .
we call this trip " an odyssey through the world in-between . " i think one of the characteristics of this region is this world between the cities : empty spaces .
we have islands - the theater pieces are the islands and our journey is like shipping between these islands . it 's a very special concept .
perhaps that 's why they asked an architect ! interview : kate laycock editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 27.02.2010 piracy problems overshadow rising digital music sales großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of european music downloads are illegal piracy accounts for 95 percent of global music downloads .
as governments begin to change legislation , legal alternatives are growing fast .
but can this be enough to lure music fans back onto the straight and narrow ? the recently released ifpi -lrb- international federation of the phonographic industry -rrb- digital music report 2010 indicated that trade revenues are up 12 percent to an estimated us $ 4.2 billion in 2009 .
however , this figure masks a 10 percent overall decrease in music sales across the board .
“ the elephant in the room here is piracy , ” remarked alex jacob of the ifpi .
“ people are changing their habits but instead of going from buying a cd on the high street to buying a cd from a legal online store like amazon or itunes , they 're actually going to the illegal file-sharing networks and downloading music there ” , he continued .
illicit sharing accounts for around 95 percent of all worldwide music downloads . in the uk alone it is estimated that the music industry lost 250 million pounds to illegal downloads in 2009 .
local artists suffer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physical album sales have fallen dramatically across europe the ifpi report highlights the severe damage piracy is causing to local music industries around the world .
in particular , three countries known for the vibrant music scenes and influential artists - spain , france and brazil - are suffering acutely , with local artist album sales and release volumes plummeting .
spain , which has one of the highest rates of illegal file-sharing in europe , has seen sales by local artists in the top 50 fall by an estimated 65 percent between 2004 and 2009 . in brazil , full priced local album releases from the five largest music companies in 2008 were down 80 percent from their 2005 level .
reluctance to intervene internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- have little or no interest in curbing this illegal activity as they wish to comfort and entice customers with a promise of safety and freedom .
instead , governments are slowly beginning to intervene with legislation changes .
president sarkozy of france led the way in 2009 by introducing a ‘ graduated response ' approach to copyright infringement , whereby users are issued with warnings before any further action is taken .
“ if they continue eventually at the end of the line they get to a sanction which could be temporary account suspension ” , said jacob .
more countries are following suit , both taiwan and south korea have put new laws on the statute books and legislation is going through parliament in the uk and new zealand .
meanwhile a landmark ruling in italy at the beginning of february this year blocked italian access to the infamous bit torrent service ‘ the pirate bay ” – a site that facilitates access to a large amount of copyright infringing material .
“ it is vital these efforts are seen through to their conclusion and followed by other governments in 2010 , " said ifpi chairman and ceo john kennedy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french legislation is designed to push consumers towards legal downloads many however are dismayed at the prospect of such state intervention .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 27.02.2010 piracy problems overshadow rising digital music sales großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of european music downloads are illegal piracy accounts for 95 percent of global music downloads .
as governments begin to change legislation , legal alternatives are growing fast .
but can this be enough to lure music fans back onto the straight and narrow ? the recently released ifpi -lrb- international federation of the phonographic industry -rrb- digital music report 2010 indicated that trade revenues are up 12 percent to an estimated us $ 4.2 billion in 2009 .
however , this figure masks a 10 percent overall decrease in music sales across the board .
“ the elephant in the room here is piracy , ” remarked alex jacob of the ifpi .
“ people are changing their habits but instead of going from buying a cd on the high street to buying a cd from a legal online store like amazon or itunes , they 're actually going to the illegal file-sharing networks and downloading music there ” , he continued .
illicit sharing accounts for around 95 percent of all worldwide music downloads . in the uk alone it is estimated that the music industry lost 250 million pounds to illegal downloads in 2009 .
local artists suffer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physical album sales have fallen dramatically across europe the ifpi report highlights the severe damage piracy is causing to local music industries around the world .
in particular , three countries known for the vibrant music scenes and influential artists - spain , france and brazil - are suffering acutely , with local artist album sales and release volumes plummeting .
spain , which has one of the highest rates of illegal file-sharing in europe , has seen sales by local artists in the top 50 fall by an estimated 65 percent between 2004 and 2009 . in brazil , full priced local album releases from the five largest music companies in 2008 were down 80 percent from their 2005 level .
reluctance to intervene internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- have little or no interest in curbing this illegal activity as they wish to comfort and entice customers with a promise of safety and freedom .
instead , governments are slowly beginning to intervene with legislation changes .
president sarkozy of france led the way in 2009 by introducing a ‘ graduated response ' approach to copyright infringement , whereby users are issued with warnings before any further action is taken .
“ if they continue eventually at the end of the line they get to a sanction which could be temporary account suspension ” , said jacob .
more countries are following suit , both taiwan and south korea have put new laws on the statute books and legislation is going through parliament in the uk and new zealand .
meanwhile a landmark ruling in italy at the beginning of february this year blocked italian access to the infamous bit torrent service ‘ the pirate bay ” – a site that facilitates access to a large amount of copyright infringing material .
“ it is vital these efforts are seen through to their conclusion and followed by other governments in 2010 , " said ifpi chairman and ceo john kennedy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french legislation is designed to push consumers towards legal downloads many however are dismayed at the prospect of such state intervention .
“ disconnecting someone 's broadband in this day and age is tantamount to throwing somebody outside of society entirely ” , says wendy grossman a member of the ‘ open rights group ' , a uk based digital rights organization .
“ for the questionable crime of downloading a music file it seems totally out of proportion to what the offence might be ” , she continued .
branching out the ifpi report also highlights how music companies are diversifying their revenue streams , offering new ways for consumers to buy and access music .
these include : subscription services ; music services bundled with devices and broadband subscriptions ; streaming services with applications for mobile devices ; advertising-supported services that offer premium services ; and online music video services .
in the last year 400 such services were licensed worldwide .
music companies have partnered with advertising-supported services such as spotify , deezer , myspace music and we7 ; isps such as tdc in denmark , terra in brazil and sky in the uk ; mobile operators such as vodafone ; handset makers such as nokia and sony ericsson ; and online video channels such as hulu and vevo .
spotify in particular has seen great success , attracting 7 million users in 6 different countries over the last 12 months .
but this is nowhere near enough to make a dent in the levels of piracy and illegal downloads worldwide .
lack of foresight critics of the big music labels like wendy grossman argue that the big record labels should have responded to the great popularity of the first music file-sharing site ‘ napster ' back in the early 2000s .
the original napster was shut down in 2001 by court order , but was an immediate hit during its three-year existence “ it should have become obvious to the music industry that the thing they should do is set up something similar that they controlled , if i were in the music industry i would be embarrassed by the fact that apple is the biggest retailer of digital music , what is this huge opportunity that these guys missed i do n't understand what they were thinking ! ” said grossman .
looking to the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have aggressive copyright protection efforts struck the wrong chord with consumers ?
tackling piracy lies in securing a joint effort between governments and isps according to the ipfi . this would also allow existing legal services to grow faster , says jacobs “ ultimately more choice will be offered to consumers because the amount of money that can be invested in new artists will start increasing again and that means there will be more choice , more diversity of genres for people to choose from – more chance of the band rehearsing in their garage today getting their break ” jacobs continued to stress that stamping out piracy all together was not on the ifpi 's agenda , “ we are not that naïve ” , he stressed , “ we do n't need in effect to stamp out piracy , but we can control it ” , he said .
wendy grossman however , remains skeptical about the effects of meddling with on-line freedom “ from the perspective of the people that the are prosecuting and chasing and berating , they have declared war on an entire generation of consumers and that is a very bad way to conduct a business because they are alienating their customers , and they are not only alienating their customers , they are alienating their best customers . ”
legal alternatives may be starting to win music industry battles , but for the foreseeable future at least the illegal download is winning the war .

as governments begin to change legislation , legal alternatives are growing fast .
but can this be enough to lure music fans back onto the straight and narrow ? the recently released ifpi -lrb- international federation of the phonographic industry -rrb- digital music report 2010 indicated that trade revenues are up 12 percent to an estimated us $ 4.2 billion in 2009 .
however , this figure masks a 10 percent overall decrease in music sales across the board .
“ the elephant in the room here is piracy , ” remarked alex jacob of the ifpi .
“ people are changing their habits but instead of going from buying a cd on the high street to buying a cd from a legal online store like amazon or itunes , they 're actually going to the illegal file-sharing networks and downloading music there ” , he continued .
illicit sharing accounts for around 95 percent of all worldwide music downloads . in the uk alone it is estimated that the music industry lost 250 million pounds to illegal downloads in 2009 .
local artists suffer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physical album sales have fallen dramatically across europe the ifpi report highlights the severe damage piracy is causing to local music industries around the world .
in particular , three countries known for the vibrant music scenes and influential artists - spain , france and brazil - are suffering acutely , with local artist album sales and release volumes plummeting .
spain , which has one of the highest rates of illegal file-sharing in europe , has seen sales by local artists in the top 50 fall by an estimated 65 percent between 2004 and 2009 . in brazil , full priced local album releases from the five largest music companies in 2008 were down 80 percent from their 2005 level .
reluctance to intervene internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- have little or no interest in curbing this illegal activity as they wish to comfort and entice customers with a promise of safety and freedom .
instead , governments are slowly beginning to intervene with legislation changes .
president sarkozy of france led the way in 2009 by introducing a ‘ graduated response ' approach to copyright infringement , whereby users are issued with warnings before any further action is taken .
“ if they continue eventually at the end of the line they get to a sanction which could be temporary account suspension ” , said jacob .
more countries are following suit , both taiwan and south korea have put new laws on the statute books and legislation is going through parliament in the uk and new zealand .
meanwhile a landmark ruling in italy at the beginning of february this year blocked italian access to the infamous bit torrent service ‘ the pirate bay ” – a site that facilitates access to a large amount of copyright infringing material .
“ it is vital these efforts are seen through to their conclusion and followed by other governments in 2010 , " said ifpi chairman and ceo john kennedy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french legislation is designed to push consumers towards legal downloads many however are dismayed at the prospect of such state intervention .
“ disconnecting someone 's broadband in this day and age is tantamount to throwing somebody outside of society entirely ” , says wendy grossman a member of the ‘ open rights group ' , a uk based digital rights organization .
“ for the questionable crime of downloading a music file it seems totally out of proportion to what the offence might be ” , she continued .
branching out the ifpi report also highlights how music companies are diversifying their revenue streams , offering new ways for consumers to buy and access music .
these include : subscription services ; music services bundled with devices and broadband subscriptions ; streaming services with applications for mobile devices ; advertising-supported services that offer premium services ; and online music video services .
in the last year 400 such services were licensed worldwide .
music companies have partnered with advertising-supported services such as spotify , deezer , myspace music and we7 ; isps such as tdc in denmark , terra in brazil and sky in the uk ; mobile operators such as vodafone ; handset makers such as nokia and sony ericsson ; and online video channels such as hulu and vevo .
spotify in particular has seen great success , attracting 7 million users in 6 different countries over the last 12 months .
but this is nowhere near enough to make a dent in the levels of piracy and illegal downloads worldwide .
lack of foresight critics of the big music labels like wendy grossman argue that the big record labels should have responded to the great popularity of the first music file-sharing site ‘ napster ' back in the early 2000s .
the original napster was shut down in 2001 by court order , but was an immediate hit during its three-year existence “ it should have become obvious to the music industry that the thing they should do is set up something similar that they controlled , if i were in the music industry i would be embarrassed by the fact that apple is the biggest retailer of digital music , what is this huge opportunity that these guys missed i do n't understand what they were thinking ! ” said grossman .
looking to the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have aggressive copyright protection efforts struck the wrong chord with consumers ?
tackling piracy lies in securing a joint effort between governments and isps according to the ipfi . this would also allow existing legal services to grow faster , says jacobs “ ultimately more choice will be offered to consumers because the amount of money that can be invested in new artists will start increasing again and that means there will be more choice , more diversity of genres for people to choose from – more chance of the band rehearsing in their garage today getting their break ” jacobs continued to stress that stamping out piracy all together was not on the ifpi 's agenda , “ we are not that naïve ” , he stressed , “ we do n't need in effect to stamp out piracy , but we can control it ” , he said .
wendy grossman however , remains skeptical about the effects of meddling with on-line freedom “ from the perspective of the people that the are prosecuting and chasing and berating , they have declared war on an entire generation of consumers and that is a very bad way to conduct a business because they are alienating their customers , and they are not only alienating their customers , they are alienating their best customers . ”
legal alternatives may be starting to win music industry battles , but for the foreseeable future at least the illegal download is winning the war .

as part of an ambitious theater project in germany 's ruhr region , audience members undertake an odyssey of their own as they are guided through six cities in two days . the theater project " odyssey europa " was masterminded not by stage directors , but by architects : matthias rick and the collective raumlabourberlin .

what does that mean ?
what role does your architectural collective play in this ambitious theater project ? matthias rick : six authors from different countries have been invited to present their own contemporary interpretations of homer 's odyssey .
the pieces they have written will be performed in six different theaters in six different cities across the ruhr region .
raumlabor have been invited to create the trip between the theater pieces - the " odyssey , " in fact . what is the " odyssey " ?

you will have to " check in " - because you are crossing a border - and then you are inside this project .
you will see the first piece . hospitality is a central idea in " odyssey , " so we have invited the citizens of the area to act as hosts .
after the first piece , a host will greet you and take you to the next theater .
this will be a local person who will take you in his car , on the subway or whatever .
it 's entirely his or her decision . bildunterschrift : in addition to the journey , audiences view six theater productions in various cities in the ruhr region the project takes place over two days .
how does this work in practice ? on the first day you will see performances in three cities : essen , oberhausen and bochum .
then comes the night , which you will be invited to spend in your host 's home .
then we have the second day in muellheim , moers and dortmund .
the transport in between the cities will vary according to the preference of your host .
it could be cars , boats , buses , metros … everyone knows that odysseus was trying to get home .
in a sprawling industrial metropolis made up of 53 separate cities , where is home ? that 's a good question .
it is the question " odyssey " is asking : where is home ?
how do you find home ?
it 's the main theme of the theater pieces and it 's also a question which has been very important to us in creating the tour .
we call this trip " an odyssey through the world in-between . " i think one of the characteristics of this region is this world between the cities : empty spaces .

as governments begin to change legislation , legal alternatives are growing fast .
but can this be enough to lure music fans back onto the straight and narrow ? the recently released ifpi -lrb- international federation of the phonographic industry -rrb- digital music report 2010 indicated that trade revenues are up 12 percent to an estimated us $ 4.2 billion in 2009 .
however , this figure masks a 10 percent overall decrease in music sales across the board .
“ the elephant in the room here is piracy , ” remarked alex jacob of the ifpi .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 27.02.2010 piracy problems overshadow rising digital music sales großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of european music downloads are illegal piracy accounts for 95 percent of global music downloads .
as governments begin to change legislation , legal alternatives are growing fast .
but can this be enough to lure music fans back onto the straight and narrow ? the recently released ifpi -lrb- international federation of the phonographic industry -rrb- digital music report 2010 indicated that trade revenues are up 12 percent to an estimated us $ 4.2 billion in 2009 .
however , this figure masks a 10 percent overall decrease in music sales across the board .
“ the elephant in the room here is piracy , ” remarked alex jacob of the ifpi .
“ people are changing their habits but instead of going from buying a cd on the high street to buying a cd from a legal online store like amazon or itunes , they 're actually going to the illegal file-sharing networks and downloading music there ” , he continued .
illicit sharing accounts for around 95 percent of all worldwide music downloads . in the uk alone it is estimated that the music industry lost 250 million pounds to illegal downloads in 2009 .
local artists suffer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physical album sales have fallen dramatically across europe the ifpi report highlights the severe damage piracy is causing to local music industries around the world .
in particular , three countries known for the vibrant music scenes and influential artists - spain , france and brazil - are suffering acutely , with local artist album sales and release volumes plummeting .
spain , which has one of the highest rates of illegal file-sharing in europe , has seen sales by local artists in the top 50 fall by an estimated 65 percent between 2004 and 2009 . in brazil , full priced local album releases from the five largest music companies in 2008 were down 80 percent from their 2005 level .
reluctance to intervene internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- have little or no interest in curbing this illegal activity as they wish to comfort and entice customers with a promise of safety and freedom .
instead , governments are slowly beginning to intervene with legislation changes .
president sarkozy of france led the way in 2009 by introducing a ‘ graduated response ' approach to copyright infringement , whereby users are issued with warnings before any further action is taken .
“ if they continue eventually at the end of the line they get to a sanction which could be temporary account suspension ” , said jacob .
more countries are following suit , both taiwan and south korea have put new laws on the statute books and legislation is going through parliament in the uk and new zealand .
meanwhile a landmark ruling in italy at the beginning of february this year blocked italian access to the infamous bit torrent service ‘ the pirate bay ” – a site that facilitates access to a large amount of copyright infringing material .
“ it is vital these efforts are seen through to their conclusion and followed by other governments in 2010 , " said ifpi chairman and ceo john kennedy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french legislation is designed to push consumers towards legal downloads many however are dismayed at the prospect of such state intervention .
“ disconnecting someone 's broadband in this day and age is tantamount to throwing somebody outside of society entirely ” , says wendy grossman a member of the ‘ open rights group ' , a uk based digital rights organization .
“ for the questionable crime of downloading a music file it seems totally out of proportion to what the offence might be ” , she continued .
branching out the ifpi report also highlights how music companies are diversifying their revenue streams , offering new ways for consumers to buy and access music .
these include : subscription services ; music services bundled with devices and broadband subscriptions ; streaming services with applications for mobile devices ; advertising-supported services that offer premium services ; and online music video services .
in the last year 400 such services were licensed worldwide .
music companies have partnered with advertising-supported services such as spotify , deezer , myspace music and we7 ; isps such as tdc in denmark , terra in brazil and sky in the uk ; mobile operators such as vodafone ; handset makers such as nokia and sony ericsson ; and online video channels such as hulu and vevo .
spotify in particular has seen great success , attracting 7 million users in 6 different countries over the last 12 months .
but this is nowhere near enough to make a dent in the levels of piracy and illegal downloads worldwide .
lack of foresight critics of the big music labels like wendy grossman argue that the big record labels should have responded to the great popularity of the first music file-sharing site ‘ napster ' back in the early 2000s .
the original napster was shut down in 2001 by court order , but was an immediate hit during its three-year existence “ it should have become obvious to the music industry that the thing they should do is set up something similar that they controlled , if i were in the music industry i would be embarrassed by the fact that apple is the biggest retailer of digital music , what is this huge opportunity that these guys missed i do n't understand what they were thinking ! ” said grossman .
looking to the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have aggressive copyright protection efforts struck the wrong chord with consumers ?
tackling piracy lies in securing a joint effort between governments and isps according to the ipfi . this would also allow existing legal services to grow faster , says jacobs “ ultimately more choice will be offered to consumers because the amount of money that can be invested in new artists will start increasing again and that means there will be more choice , more diversity of genres for people to choose from – more chance of the band rehearsing in their garage today getting their break ” jacobs continued to stress that stamping out piracy all together was not on the ifpi 's agenda , “ we are not that naïve ” , he stressed , “ we do n't need in effect to stamp out piracy , but we can control it ” , he said .
wendy grossman however , remains skeptical about the effects of meddling with on-line freedom “ from the perspective of the people that the are prosecuting and chasing and berating , they have declared war on an entire generation of consumers and that is a very bad way to conduct a business because they are alienating their customers , and they are not only alienating their customers , they are alienating their best customers . ”
legal alternatives may be starting to win music industry battles , but for the foreseeable future at least the illegal download is winning the war .

it could be cars , boats , buses , metros … everyone knows that odysseus was trying to get home .
in a sprawling industrial metropolis made up of 53 separate cities , where is home ? that 's a good question .
it is the question " odyssey " is asking : where is home ?
how do you find home ?
it 's the main theme of the theater pieces and it 's also a question which has been very important to us in creating the tour .
we call this trip " an odyssey through the world in-between . " i think one of the characteristics of this region is this world between the cities : empty spaces .
we have islands - the theater pieces are the islands and our journey is like shipping between these islands . it 's a very special concept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 27.02.2010 piracy problems overshadow rising digital music sales großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of european music downloads are illegal piracy accounts for 95 percent of global music downloads .
as governments begin to change legislation , legal alternatives are growing fast .
but can this be enough to lure music fans back onto the straight and narrow ? the recently released ifpi -lrb- international federation of the phonographic industry -rrb- digital music report 2010 indicated that trade revenues are up 12 percent to an estimated us $ 4.2 billion in 2009 .
however , this figure masks a 10 percent overall decrease in music sales across the board .
“ the elephant in the room here is piracy , ” remarked alex jacob of the ifpi .
“ people are changing their habits but instead of going from buying a cd on the high street to buying a cd from a legal online store like amazon or itunes , they 're actually going to the illegal file-sharing networks and downloading music there ” , he continued .
illicit sharing accounts for around 95 percent of all worldwide music downloads . in the uk alone it is estimated that the music industry lost 250 million pounds to illegal downloads in 2009 .
local artists suffer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : physical album sales have fallen dramatically across europe the ifpi report highlights the severe damage piracy is causing to local music industries around the world .
in particular , three countries known for the vibrant music scenes and influential artists - spain , france and brazil - are suffering acutely , with local artist album sales and release volumes plummeting .
spain , which has one of the highest rates of illegal file-sharing in europe , has seen sales by local artists in the top 50 fall by an estimated 65 percent between 2004 and 2009 . in brazil , full priced local album releases from the five largest music companies in 2008 were down 80 percent from their 2005 level .
reluctance to intervene internet service providers -lrb- isps -rrb- have little or no interest in curbing this illegal activity as they wish to comfort and entice customers with a promise of safety and freedom .
instead , governments are slowly beginning to intervene with legislation changes .
president sarkozy of france led the way in 2009 by introducing a ‘ graduated response ' approach to copyright infringement , whereby users are issued with warnings before any further action is taken .
“ if they continue eventually at the end of the line they get to a sanction which could be temporary account suspension ” , said jacob .
more countries are following suit , both taiwan and south korea have put new laws on the statute books and legislation is going through parliament in the uk and new zealand .
meanwhile a landmark ruling in italy at the beginning of february this year blocked italian access to the infamous bit torrent service ‘ the pirate bay ” – a site that facilitates access to a large amount of copyright infringing material .
“ it is vital these efforts are seen through to their conclusion and followed by other governments in 2010 , " said ifpi chairman and ceo john kennedy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french legislation is designed to push consumers towards legal downloads many however are dismayed at the prospect of such state intervention .
“ disconnecting someone 's broadband in this day and age is tantamount to throwing somebody outside of society entirely ” , says wendy grossman a member of the ‘ open rights group ' , a uk based digital rights organization .
“ for the questionable crime of downloading a music file it seems totally out of proportion to what the offence might be ” , she continued .
branching out the ifpi report also highlights how music companies are diversifying their revenue streams , offering new ways for consumers to buy and access music .
these include : subscription services ; music services bundled with devices and broadband subscriptions ; streaming services with applications for mobile devices ; advertising-supported services that offer premium services ; and online music video services .
in the last year 400 such services were licensed worldwide .
music companies have partnered with advertising-supported services such as spotify , deezer , myspace music and we7 ; isps such as tdc in denmark , terra in brazil and sky in the uk ; mobile operators such as vodafone ; handset makers such as nokia and sony ericsson ; and online video channels such as hulu and vevo .
spotify in particular has seen great success , attracting 7 million users in 6 different countries over the last 12 months .
but this is nowhere near enough to make a dent in the levels of piracy and illegal downloads worldwide .
lack of foresight critics of the big music labels like wendy grossman argue that the big record labels should have responded to the great popularity of the first music file-sharing site ‘ napster ' back in the early 2000s .
the original napster was shut down in 2001 by court order , but was an immediate hit during its three-year existence “ it should have become obvious to the music industry that the thing they should do is set up something similar that they controlled , if i were in the music industry i would be embarrassed by the fact that apple is the biggest retailer of digital music , what is this huge opportunity that these guys missed i do n't understand what they were thinking ! ” said grossman .
looking to the future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : have aggressive copyright protection efforts struck the wrong chord with consumers ?
tackling piracy lies in securing a joint effort between governments and isps according to the ipfi . this would also allow existing legal services to grow faster , says jacobs “ ultimately more choice will be offered to consumers because the amount of money that can be invested in new artists will start increasing again and that means there will be more choice , more diversity of genres for people to choose from – more chance of the band rehearsing in their garage today getting their break ” jacobs continued to stress that stamping out piracy all together was not on the ifpi 's agenda , “ we are not that naïve ” , he stressed , “ we do n't need in effect to stamp out piracy , but we can control it ” , he said .
wendy grossman however , remains skeptical about the effects of meddling with on-line freedom “ from the perspective of the people that the are prosecuting and chasing and berating , they have declared war on an entire generation of consumers and that is a very bad way to conduct a business because they are alienating their customers , and they are not only alienating their customers , they are alienating their best customers . ”
legal alternatives may be starting to win music industry battles , but for the foreseeable future at least the illegal download is winning the war .
