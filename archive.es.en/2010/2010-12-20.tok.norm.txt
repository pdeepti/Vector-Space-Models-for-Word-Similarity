program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 20.12.2010 last throw of the dice for mideast peace , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu 's settlement plans alienate obama from abbas a new round of shuttle diplomacy in the middle east has taken place as us envoy george mitchell tries to restart peace negotiations between israel and the palestinians .
however , regional experts remain pessimistic . mitchell held talks with israeli and palestinian officials last week in a desperate attempt to salvage negotiations over a peace deal in the region .
mitchell , who was last in the region in october , was attempting to bring the two sides together for talks for the first time since a 10-month freeze on israeli settlement building on palestinian territory expired at the end of september.the palestinians have refused to engage in peace talks since the moratorium on settlement building ended .
however , the us envoy arrived with little hope of getting palestinian president mahmoud abbas and israeli premier benjamin netanyahu in the same room together with the best hope of progress coming from a reopening of " proximity " talks with the us acting as a go-between .
during his meetings , mitchell suggested a six-week period of " parallel " talks where negotiators would hold separate talks with us officials .
however , the failure of the us to secure a new israeli settlement freeze has not only ended any chance of direct negotiations but has put in jeopardy any prospect of a return to any kind of dialogue .
settlement building is a core issue in the palestinians list of grievances against israel , along with disagreements over borders , security , jerusalem , refugees and the access to water supplies .
netanyahu effectively announced last week that the united states had given up on trying to force israel to abandon its settlement plans .
washington later confirmed it had dropped its bid to persuade israel to renew a partial freeze on west bank settlement construction after israel rejected a package of incentives - including advanced us jet fighters - in exchange for a new three-month ban .
experts believe that the failure of the us in preventing further settlement building has seriously undermined washington 's credibility and ability to broker a deal .
settlement defeat undermines ' weak ' united states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitchell -lrb- l . -rrb- arrived just a week after the us admits defeat " the us administration has given up for now on achieving a settlement moratorium which would be essential to stop the further fragmentation of the territory available for a future palestinian state , " dr. murial asseburg , the head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" indeed , the israeli government now feels vindicated . "
the us is the only actor accepted by both parties as a broker which has the necessary clout not only to get to an agreement but also to give the necessary security guarantees , she said .
however , the effect of this failure was now clear .
" the us administration is now perceived as being defeated , weak , unwilling and incapable of engaging in consistent and effective diplomacy and of exerting the necessary pressure needed to achieve peace in the region . "
with confidence over the current us approach to the peace process dwindling , there is a growing belief that washington should adapt its policy to the changing realities in the region if it hopes to broker any kind of deal .
however , fawaz gerges , professor of middle eastern politics and international relations at the london school of economics and political science , believes the americans ' hands are now tied by bonds of their own making .
embattled obama leaves arab supporters exposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's whole foreign policy hinges on middle east peace " president obama has lost the struggle over the settlement issue and has seen the two-state solution , the major plank not only of his middle east strategy but his whole foreign policy , destroyed before his eyes , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing obama can do now ; this is the end of the peace process as it currently exists and we wo n't see any change until the next us presidential election . "
gerges said that obama 's weakened position , both internationally and domestically , has ruled the us out of the equation , leaving israel empowered and the pro-west arabs - including president abbas - dangerously exposed .
the implications of washington 's failure could affect the wider middle east .
" abbas has invested everything in the belief that only the us can deliver in the peace process and that obama was committed to the two-state solution , a belief held by other pro-west arab leaders in the region , " gerges said .
" this has strengthened the hand of the pro-iran arabs - such as syria , hezbollah and hamas - who support the resistance model ; the belief that only resistance can force israel to accept an independent palestinian state . "
gerges went as far as to forecast a return to hostilities before the summer of 2011 .
" it is highly likely that we will see some violence or a return to conflict in the next six months or so , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a us commitment , abbas finds himself exposed according to muriel asseburg the seemingly intractable situation leaves three options for the palestinians : " going for a unilateral declaration of statehood , for a ' uniting for peace ' approach through the general assembly or for dissolving the palestinian authority and demanding annexation of the palestinian territories and equal rights in israel - the most frightening option for the israeli government and public .

advocates hope that the increased use of social networking will get younger europeans interested in what happens in brussels . public apathy is always a big problem for communicators in european union institutions . fewer than half of eligible voters turned out for ep elections in 2009 , continuing a decline that started 30 years ago . but there 's a new breed of european politicians who are tackling the problem of a public disconnect one keystroke at a time .
one of them is damien abad , a 30-year-old member of the european parliament , or mep .
the man from southeastern france says it 's time eu politicians stop just lamenting the lack of interest from constituents and do something about it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european members of parliament are slowly learning how to use facebook so , his idea is to teach his fellow meps what has come all too naturally for people of his generation - using social networking sites like facebook , flickr and twitter as a way to share a personal and informal view of the otherwise obscure european institutions .
" in order for european people to love europe they have to know europe ! "
abad explains .
and in order for european parliamentarians to tweet , they have to know twitter . so abad , who already communicates regularly in 140-character messages , set up a series of educational seminars for his fellow parliamentarians and their staffs to show how and why to use the new social technologies . he thinks it will catch on , but acknowledges , " it 's necessary for us to find the most active meps in order to create a buzz . "
most meps have never heard of twitter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy buzek calls social networking an " opportunity we need to seize . "
but abad 's got an uphill climb .
only about third to a half of members have a twitter account . a survey a year ago showed that 62 percent of parliamentarians had never even heard of twitter or had never used it and did n't intend to .
jerzy buzek , the parliamentary president and polish represntative has set a good example , opening his own twitter account at the beginning of this year . at age 60 , buzek proves it 's not just a technology for the young gadget-crazy crowd . he warmly addressed the first social-media training session , encouraging participation .
" web 2.0 constitutes for us politicians an opportunity we need to seize , " he said in a pre-recorded video message , shown at one of the workshops held earlier this month in brussels .
" with facebook , twitter and other 2.0 tools , we can get reach out to our citizens on a daily , almost personal basis .
i see it every day through my facebook and twitter accounts . "
the keynote lecturer at that same workshop day was vincent ducrey , a well-known online consultant , who advises the french government on its social media policies and has written a book called the " guide of influence . "
ducrey has worked out meticulous models of the 24-hour news cycle and precisely how to use it for maximum messaging effect .
he said technophobe meps should just get over it , for everybody 's sake , not least their own .
" it 's not about a special party , it 's about democracy , " ducrey insists .
" if we want a high level of participation a high level of voters in three years , they need to start to interact , to raise the question of europe as soon as possible .
and twitter is a good way to do it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 62 percent of meps have never heard of twitter connecting person-to-person ducrey says politicians should learn to be tactical but also personable , and should never have an assistant writing their tweets .
one of the believers who 's urging her colleagues to hop on board is marietje schaake , a dutch mep who says she would n't be in brussels at all if it were n't for social media .
she says with a miniscule campaign budget in 2009 , virtually all the outreach in her campaign was , well , virtual .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 20.12.2010 view from kandahar : ' petraeus believes in military victory ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kandahar : a war-torn city according to the us annual strategy review , the us troop surge in afghanistan has been partly successful .
but many observers on the ground say that not much has changed for the better . the dutch researcher and afghanistan expert alex strick van linschoten is one of the few westerners who live in kandahar . he is the co-editor of ' my life with the taliban , ' a book about mullah abdul salam zaeef , the taliban ’ s ambassador to pakistan in 2001 .
he 's currently working on a study on the links between the taliban and al-qaeda , which will be published in conjunction with the center on international cooperation , new york university . deutsche welle : the us troop surge has been visible in the south of afghanistan since the spring of 2010 .
what effect has it had so far on kandahar ? alex strick van linschoten : in some ways , nothing has changed .
there have been foreign troops in and outside kandahar city for several years .
but there are some cosmetic shifts .
you have a lot of traffic jams in the city now .
before , there used to be mainly canadian troops in kandahar , and they would drive around the city so that they would n't cause traffic jams .
this helped to protect them -lrb- as well as locals in the area -rrb- from being hit by ieds -lrb- improvised explosive devices -rrb- .
but now the americans drive straight through the city .
so when an ied goes off , people blame the americans for driving through .
they do n't blame the taliban for placing the bomb .
you also have much more air traffic compared to the last year .
what is the population 's reaction to the conflict ? there are all sorts of things that resonate badly with the people .
i spoke to a cameraman who was embedded with the us troops in arghandab district for a documentary .
he mentioned the case of a us commander who went to a village telling the elders , " you have to show us where all the ieds and mines are , in and around your village .
if not , i 'm going to bombard your village . "
the elders said , " we do n't know where they are . " the local population feels reminded of the soviet times , when there was a concept of collective responsibility as well - something actually forbidden by the 1949 geneva convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war .
how would you describe the situation in kandahar ? people are depressed .
the younger ones are trying to leave .
just a few days ago , two deputy directors of departments were assassinated .
anyone who works for the government is being threatened .
the taliban now have a commission in the city calling on people to leave their jobs .
they know exactly who is doing what .
there is no way that the afghan government or the americans can protect all the people .
the military certainly ca n't pay enough for civilians to risk their lives for a government that no one really believes is going to survive in the present form .
how do the taliban operate in town ? they have a mediation commission .
when you get a ' night letter ' , for example from the taliban , warning the locals not to work with what the taliban call the occupiers , you can object to this letter , arguing that you have n't done anything wrong .
it is their own ' hearts and minds ' campaign .
on the other hand , i do n't see too much of the ideological side in kandahar .
yes , islam is a motivating factor for the insurgency , but i never really found that islam was the main motivating factor for the taliban in the south .
there are many other factors that people think of and talk about before islam .
the us military and government say that they have gained ' momentum ' and that they see progress ... my sense is that general petraeus thinks that he can win the war militarily .
i think he may be overestimating his ability to achieve this goal , and underestimating at the same time the effect it has on the taliban .
i do n't think petraeus has a serious interest in a settlement that sees the taliban as a part of afghan society .
was the strategy of petraeus ' predecessor more promising ? compared to petraeus , mcchrystal seemed like he understood things far better and had a better appreciation of the effects of us military actions .
you can see it in the number of night raids .
when you look at the isaf statistics , about the day after petraeus arrived there was a massive spike in night raids .
petraeus has also restarted the air war .
in november , compared to the last year , three times as many bombs were dropped on afghanistan . to what extent is the western and afghan military strategy hurting the taliban ?
how do they react ? the night raids certainly have an effect .
they catch or kill a lot of them .
but it does n't seem to have either irrevocably damaged their morale or their ability to carry out attacks .
there does n't seem to be a change in the number of assassinations in the city .
it is tough for the taliban , but they will come back in spring and start all over again . some argue that the taliban are about to change and possibly get more radical as a result of the war .
do you agree ? you can see it in terms of their tactics in the number of beheadings .
that would not have happened before .
it is the same in terms of their attitude to authority , killing elders for example , and also talking back to quetta , the senior leadership , in not being completely subservient to them .
you see it in the general fragmentation also : the taliban shadow governor in kandahar city does n't have control over all taliban groups any more .
a lot of civilian killings in the city are n't ordered from quetta . they often comes from small groups .
some may be pushed by pakistan .
but you have a lot more voices now than before .
what does that mean for the months ahead ? the worry , of course , is that all of these things may eventually lead to a sort of taliban that will look more to an international ' jihad ' with younger people in charge on the side of the insurgency , who have only lived in conflict and war , and who do n't even remember the old afghanistan , or the meaning of peace , from before the soviet war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 20.12.2010 bad attitudes run throughout the worst bundesliga 11 of 2010 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the going got tough , cologne 's mondragon just left some players just ca n't help it .
they 're not very good .
others combine poor performances with delusions of grandeur and animosity toward the world .
deutsche welle identifies the worst offenders . in goal many players pitch a hissy fit if they get benched , but ex-cologne keeper faryd mondragon took his tantrum to a previously unknown biblical level .
having been relieved of his starting role for poor performances and absence due to international duties , the colombian refused to play at all , and then held a press conference comparing his martyrdom to that of jesus .
cologne are apparently non-believers , shipping the malcontent messiah to philadelphia union in the mls .
cologne fans will be happy that faryd is mondra-gone .
the back line among the poor defenders , one particularly stands out .
germany 's leading football magazine , kicker , has ranked bremen 's mikael silvestre the worst player in the entire league , and he was a consensus choice for that distinction among the deutsche welle sport brain-trust as well .
the frenchman tries hard , but is clearly past his prime and was one major reason for bremen 's sputtering start .
bildunterschrift : silvestre ca n't keep up with the league 's youngsters paired with him in our porous central defense is gladbach 's anderson .
the 22-year-old brazilian was a major signing for the foals this summer , but he has " led " his new club to a truly laughable record of 47 goals conceded .
as dw sports writer nick amies succinctly put it ... " atrocious . "
on the flailing flanks , we have hamburg 's guy demel .
once a mainstay in northern germany , the ivorian has become , in the words of dw sports editor matt hermann , " a walking lapse in concentration . "
and not only has hamburg coach armin veh removed him from the starting line-up .
he did n't even make the bench in his club 's last match of the year .
joining him is bremen 's petri pasanen .
hamburg 's arch-rivals have always conceded lots of goals for a top side , but this year , the problem is worse than ever .
bremen 's goal difference is a lousy -12 .
opponents encounter little resistance on the wings , and the finnish veteran has simply not been up to the job .
the problem for bremen is that no one else has been , either .
the midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weather in germany has n't suited camoranesi , r among the candidates put forward for the middle of the pitch were bremen 's marko arnautovic and bayern 's franck ribery , but injuries have somewhat mitigated their poor production .
still , our mediocre midfield features some big names .
stuttgart 's mauro camaronesi has had a lot of highlights in his career , including winning the italian league title and the world cup .
but he 'll want to forget his time at stuttgart thus far .
brought in to great hoopla in the summer , he ca n't even make the starting line-up of a team that 's wintering in the drop zone .
matt put forward wolfsburg 's josue , a former team captain relegated to the bench , but dw sports writer jefferson chase overruled him in favor of the wolves ' diego .
when you pay some 18 million euros for a star with a history of excellence in the bundesliga , you expect more than a handful of goals with the odd assist thrown in .
the brazilian is also hot-headed and is very lucky not to have gotten sent off this season .
value for money is something else .
another playmaker who 's not making the grade is gladbach 's juan arango .
two goals , three assists and one very foolish red card that cost the foals a chance to get much needed points against hoffenheim are the venezuelan 's sad balance sheet .
as nick succinctly put it ... " atrocious . "
and lest anyone think we 're picking on foreigners , completing our flailing foursome is bremen 's aaron hunt .
the german youngster was charged with replacing mesut oezil this season , and he simply has n't been able to .
this may not be entirely his fault , as he was originally a wing striker and some problems adjusting to a new role could have been expected .
but one thing is already clear : a playmaker , he is not .
the forwards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobadilla may love gladbach , but he has n't done them any favors as everyone knows , strikers run hot and cold , so one player scoring more or less than another is often just a reflection of luck and form , and not a fundamental difference in quality .
in order to make the dw sports worst eleven , a forward had to do more than just not score .
he had to kick up a stink in the process .
for that reason , schalke 's edu gets a free pass , despite being nominated by matt .
ciprian marica , who earned a three-match ban late on , when stuttgart really needed him , attracted jefferson 's ire and almost earned a spot in the hall of shame .
but he still came up short .
that 's because matt made a persuasive argument for hamburg 's paolo guerrero , calling him " among the most delusionally self-important players in the league . "
rarely have fans been treated to so much pouting and gesticulating from a player who has a grand total of two goals to his credit after 17 games .
hamburg had great hopes for the peruvian when they brought him from bayern in 2006 - three-and-a-half years on there 's little doubt that he 's not going to fulfill them .
but even guerrero could n't top the histrionics of gladbach 's raul bobadilla .
apparently after taking anger-management lessons from diego maradona , the argentinian went on a rampage in the foals ' match against hanover in early december .
although his team were leading , bobadilla was so incensed in the first half that he lashed out physically at an opponent and verbally at an official , earning himself a straight red .
gladbach went on to lose the match , and bobilla has been suspended indefinitely .
not what your team needs in the struggle against the drop .
or as nick succinctly put it ... " just plain atrocious . "

the un 's ban ki-moon says peacekeepers there will not stand down from their mission and warned against attacks on un troops . the united nations and the european union are increasing the pressure on laurent gbagbo , who is clinging to power despite clear indications that he lost last month 's presidential poll to alassane quattara , who has been recognized as the winner by the international community .
on monday , the eu imposed a visa ban on gbagbo and 18 other high-ranking officials .
an assets freeze could also come into effect later this week . the us and canada have also threatened to impose sanctions . earlier , un secretary-general ban ki-moon rejected a demand from the contested ivory coast government that un peacekeepers leave the country .
former colonial power france also confirmed that its forces would stay . nations ' human rights chief said sunday that more than 50 people have been killed and " massive violations of human rights " have taken place in ivory coast since thursday . navi pillay , the un high commissioner for human rights , said the un had received reports of hundreds of people being abducted by military and militia members close to laurant gbagbo , some of whom were later found dead . one of gbagbo 's military leaders urged young people to prepare for combat with the un and french peacekeepers .
but ban warned troops loyal to gbagbo not to consider attacking international peacekeepers . " there will be consequences for those who have perpetrated or orchestrated any such actions or do so in the future , " ban said in a statement regarding attacks on troop stationed with the un mission . ban also said he was " deeply concerned " by recent attacks on un patrols , blaming " security forces apparently loyal to mr. gbagbo . " the un has offered details of two attacks in two days on its troops and military observers , with two employees sustaining injuries in the altercations . " we 're going to continue our patrols but we 're not seeking confrontation , " unoci spokesperson hamadoun toure said sunday .
" there are sensitive areas where we do n't go , near the presidency .
we 're increasing our vigilance , and we 're ready for anything . " parallel governments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gbagbo -lrb- l . -rrb- and ouattara both claim they won the presidency roughly 10,000 un troops are stationed in the country , along with a further 900 from france .
among other tasks , the troops are protecting the capital abidjan 's golf hotel , where opposition presidential candidate ouattara has assembled his own cabinet and is trying to run an alternative government . the united nations , european union , african union and the ivory coast 's election commission all recognize ouattara as the winner of november 's runoff presidential ballot . nevertheless , gbagbo is clinging to his position , supported by a separate national election body , arguing that he won the vote on a technicality .
as incumbent , gbagbo was able to successfully retain the loyalty of the official armed forces and to keep his hold on most government institutions , while ouattara and his supporters have little more than international support . " the international community has spoken with one voice regarding mr. gbagbo 's attempt to hold on to power , " ban said in his statement , indicating a recent pledge of support for ouattara from the west african economic union , ecowas . the election was supposed to be another step on the road to stability for the poor , war-torn country , which was once the engine room of the west african economy . sporadic outbreaks of violence in abidjan have been met with severe military crackdowns , but the situation is largely calm at present .
the un has said it would try to protect civilians in the capital , as well as ouattara 's makeshift headquarters , should the need arise . ban said the un security council planned to meet monday to discuss the situation in ivory coast and review the mandate of the un mission , which will expire on december 31 . author : mark hallam , martin kuebler , rob mudge -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in order to make the dw sports worst eleven , a forward had to do more than just not score .
he had to kick up a stink in the process .
for that reason , schalke 's edu gets a free pass , despite being nominated by matt .
ciprian marica , who earned a three-match ban late on , when stuttgart really needed him , attracted jefferson 's ire and almost earned a spot in the hall of shame .
but he still came up short .
that 's because matt made a persuasive argument for hamburg 's paolo guerrero , calling him " among the most delusionally self-important players in the league . "
rarely have fans been treated to so much pouting and gesticulating from a player who has a grand total of two goals to his credit after 17 games .
hamburg had great hopes for the peruvian when they brought him from bayern in 2006 - three-and-a-half years on there 's little doubt that he 's not going to fulfill them .
but even guerrero could n't top the histrionics of gladbach 's raul bobadilla .
apparently after taking anger-management lessons from diego maradona , the argentinian went on a rampage in the foals ' match against hanover in early december .
although his team were leading , bobadilla was so incensed in the first half that he lashed out physically at an opponent and verbally at an official , earning himself a straight red .
gladbach went on to lose the match , and bobilla has been suspended indefinitely .
not what your team needs in the struggle against the drop .
or as nick succinctly put it ... " just plain atrocious . "

the un 's ban ki-moon says peacekeepers there will not stand down from their mission and warned against attacks on un troops . the united nations and the european union are increasing the pressure on laurent gbagbo , who is clinging to power despite clear indications that he lost last month 's presidential poll to alassane quattara , who has been recognized as the winner by the international community .
on monday , the eu imposed a visa ban on gbagbo and 18 other high-ranking officials .
an assets freeze could also come into effect later this week . the us and canada have also threatened to impose sanctions . earlier , un secretary-general ban ki-moon rejected a demand from the contested ivory coast government that un peacekeepers leave the country .
former colonial power france also confirmed that its forces would stay . nations ' human rights chief said sunday that more than 50 people have been killed and " massive violations of human rights " have taken place in ivory coast since thursday . navi pillay , the un high commissioner for human rights , said the un had received reports of hundreds of people being abducted by military and militia members close to laurant gbagbo , some of whom were later found dead . one of gbagbo 's military leaders urged young people to prepare for combat with the un and french peacekeepers .
but ban warned troops loyal to gbagbo not to consider attacking international peacekeepers . " there will be consequences for those who have perpetrated or orchestrated any such actions or do so in the future , " ban said in a statement regarding attacks on troop stationed with the un mission . ban also said he was " deeply concerned " by recent attacks on un patrols , blaming " security forces apparently loyal to mr. gbagbo . " the un has offered details of two attacks in two days on its troops and military observers , with two employees sustaining injuries in the altercations . " we 're going to continue our patrols but we 're not seeking confrontation , " unoci spokesperson hamadoun toure said sunday .
" there are sensitive areas where we do n't go , near the presidency .
we 're increasing our vigilance , and we 're ready for anything . " parallel governments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gbagbo -lrb- l . -rrb- and ouattara both claim they won the presidency roughly 10,000 un troops are stationed in the country , along with a further 900 from france .
among other tasks , the troops are protecting the capital abidjan 's golf hotel , where opposition presidential candidate ouattara has assembled his own cabinet and is trying to run an alternative government . the united nations , european union , african union and the ivory coast 's election commission all recognize ouattara as the winner of november 's runoff presidential ballot . nevertheless , gbagbo is clinging to his position , supported by a separate national election body , arguing that he won the vote on a technicality .
as incumbent , gbagbo was able to successfully retain the loyalty of the official armed forces and to keep his hold on most government institutions , while ouattara and his supporters have little more than international support . " the international community has spoken with one voice regarding mr. gbagbo 's attempt to hold on to power , " ban said in his statement , indicating a recent pledge of support for ouattara from the west african economic union , ecowas . the election was supposed to be another step on the road to stability for the poor , war-torn country , which was once the engine room of the west african economy . sporadic outbreaks of violence in abidjan have been met with severe military crackdowns , but the situation is largely calm at present .
the un has said it would try to protect civilians in the capital , as well as ouattara 's makeshift headquarters , should the need arise . ban said the un security council planned to meet monday to discuss the situation in ivory coast and review the mandate of the un mission , which will expire on december 31 . author : mark hallam , martin kuebler , rob mudge -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the statement by the military command , carried on the north korean news agency kcna , continued , " the world should properly know who is the true champion of peace and who is the real provocateur of a war . "
south korea fired dozens of artillery rounds during a live-fire exercise from the island of yeonpyeong on monday .
the island lies near the border with north korea , which has threatened retaliation .
after a similar drill last month , north korean military shelled the island , killing four people .
the united nations security council met for an emergency session on sunday over the growing tensions on the korean peninsula , but was unable to come up with a unanimous response to the crisis .
the majority of the 15 council members have insisted " on a clear-cut condemnation of the november 23 attack " by north korea on south korea in an artillery shelling incident , said susan rice , the us envoy to the united nations .
" there was not unanimity on that point , " she said .
russia and china were instead pushing for an ambiguous statement that would not blame north korea for the crisis , she added .
" it is important that we keep in mind that this tense situation springs from one source and one source alone - the consistently provocative behavior of north korea , " she said .
russia , which had demanded the meeting , said a special un envoy was needed to facilitate talks between north and south korea .
according to a draft statement distributed by russia to the other 14 security council members , it instead called for " maximum restraint " by the two sides .
both koreas have warned they will use military means to defend the disputed border zone on the west coast , raising concerns in the international community that the standoff could rapidly escalate .
military exercises test tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia called for restraint from both sides in a statement to the un security council following the shelling of the south korean island of yeonpyeong by the north last month , tensions have spiked between the two neighbors .
the attack on the island killed two civilians and two south korean marines .
the south 's latest plans to conduct live-fire drills on the island were backed by the united states . residents there were told to move into shelters .
north korea warned of " catastrophe " if the south went ahead with the military exercise , saying it would trigger all-out conflict on the peninsula .
the yonhap news agency , quoting a south korean government source , reported that pyongyang had raised an alert for artillery units along the west coast .
council split over whether to assign blame western envoys inside sunday 's eight-hour closed door meeting told the reuters news agency , on condition of anonymity , that council members were split over whether to assign blame for the crisis to north korea .
the us , britain , france and non-permanent member japan supported the idea , with russia and china against the move .
the two holdouts eventually revised their draft statement , condemning last month 's attack which ban has called " one of the gravest incidents since the end of the korean war . "
they did not , however , explicitly blame north korea for the attack . russia 's role the russian draft resolution released sunday sought " a resumption of dialogue and resolution of all problems dividing -lsb- the two sides -rsb- exclusively through peaceful diplomatic means . "
in the resolution , russia calls for un secretary general ban ki-moon to " dispatch without delay " a special representative to seoul and pyongyang .
russia called for the emergency meeting on saturday and expressed some anger that it was only to be convened a day later .
the security council is currently led by the us , and a statement said the meeting was organized for sunday so that countries had time to consult with their governments .
commitment to re-admit inspectors according to the television news channel cnn , a us envoy to north korea , bill richardson , had won agreement to re-admit un nuclear weapons inspectors .
but a spokesman for the us state department , philip crowley , said the government was skeptical that north korea would in fact re-admit the inspectors , who were expelled a year ago .
" north korea talks a great game .
they always do .
the real issue is what will they do , " crowley said . author : martin kuebler , thomas sheldrick , michael lawton -lrb- ap , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but silent night – a song known the world over – has very humble origins . silent night 's roots can be traced back to the tiny village of oberndorf in the state of salzburg , austria .
it was written by priest , father joseph mohr , and in its original german form was called , " stille nacht , heilige nacht " , literally , " silent night , holy night . "
mohr 's lyrics were then set to music by schoolteacher franz xaver gruber and the song was first performed in the church of st. nicholas in oberndorf , austria during the christmas service of december 24th 1818 .
unlike the dreamy lullaby we know today , in its original incarnation it was an up-tempo dance tune .
all is calm , all is bright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silent night 's composers : father joseph mohr and franz xaver gruber as mohr 's written reminiscences make no mention of a source of inspiration for the song , its imagined origins have spawned a number of urban myths over the years .
one story has it that the organ in the church of st. nicholas was broken and so a new song had to be hastily written for a different instrument .
another , and perhaps more likely explanation , suggests that mohr simply wanted a new christmas song he could play on his guitar .
the song was translated into english in 1859 by john freeman young , second bishop for the episcopal diocese of florida , and quickly became a popular christmas standard both in religious services and with door-to-door carol singers .
during the 1914 world war i christmas truce , silent night was sung simultaneously by servicemen in english , french and german ; the only song soldiers on both sides of the front line had in common .
sleep in heavenly peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with tourists : the silent night memorial chapel in oberndorf over the decades the song has steadily gained popularity , and has been recorded time and again by pop artists such as the temptations , mahalia jackson and elvis presley .
they each added their own personal touches to the carol , and mahalia jackson ’ s lazy , blues-influenced version even holds the rather unusual honor of being one of the best-selling singles of all time … in norway .
since its first performance on that chilly christmas eve in 1818 , silent night has since been translated into 44 languages and remains , to this day , one of the world ’ s best known and beloved carols .

the ensemble is gearing up for its 40th anniversary but looks back on a history that has had its share of challenges . a swallow interrupts its journey to pass through a family 's house on new year 's day , bringing them wealth and prosperity for the coming year .
that 's an image from a ukrainian folk song called " shchedryk , " known to ears in the english-speaking world by way of peter wihousky 's holiday adaptation : the " carol of the bells . " the folk song is also the namesake of one of ukraine 's most famous groups of young singers , the shchedryk children 's choir .
the singers have won awards throughout the world , and in 2005 they even performed with the pope in audience . like in the song from which the ensemble takes its name , the new year marks a special turning point for the shchedryk children 's choir .
the group celebrates its 40th anniversary in 2011 . political challenges the children 's ensemble got its start in 1971 , founded by the well-known ukrainian choirmaster iryna mykolayivna sablina .
her goal was to offer a contrast to the idealized image of soviet childhood that many other youth ensembles in her country promoted . instead , she focused on the classical repertoire and aimed to develop the artistic and musical sensibilities of the children she conducted .
but those goals were n't viewed favorably by ukrainian authorities , said her husband , conductor roman kofman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international tours are nothing new for the group , which sung at the 2010 beethovenfest " i must say , iryna is a woman who never compromises and she sometimes got into difficulties when it comes to cultural politics , " kofman explained .
" the cultural committee summoned her and said of their repertoire , ' songs about lenin - none .
songs about the party - none .
songs about the homeland - none .
songs by western european composers - 197 .
songs by russian composers - also nearly 100 .
what do you have to say for yourself ? " ' kofman said his wife replied : " i have a responsibility to the parents for the aesthetic education of these children .
give me songs about lenin or the party of the same musical standard as a bach cantata or a song by rachmaninov - but they just do n't exist . " into the future the political challenges of the 1970s and 80s are now history for the orchestra , and a new but familiar face is at the podium .
iryna sablina retired from conducting the group in 2004 , and her daughter , marianna sablina , has now taken charge . around 50 members make up the choir , but not all of them go on tour .
international appearances are reserved for the best singers within the ensemble . " the choristers are selected according to strict qualitative criteria and come from all levels of society , " marianna sablina explained , adding that they meet three times a week to practice . " their repertoire still draws from classic western and russian composers , but also includes ukrainian folk music traditions . have a listen to the live recordings below to hear some festive selections sung by the shchedryk children 's choir at a deutsche welle concerto discreto concert in bonn . author : inge ivanovic -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as the government tries to overcome criticism after a string of financial scandals . india 's congress party has promised to combat corruption by fast-tracking court cases .
the occasion was the plenary of the ruling party , marking the 125th year of its foundation .
in a three-day conference that ended monday , and was attended by about 15,000 members , the congress vowed zero tolerance for corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congress president sonia gandhi attacks the opposition party bjp party president sonia gandhi outlined an agenda , including fast-tracking of all cases concerning corruption and full transparency in all procurements and contracts .
" there is merit in instituting a new system of fast-tracking all cases that concern corruption by public servants , including politicians-including all of us , " gandhi stated . telecom license scandal the congress party has been hit by a string of corruption scandals and is going through its roughest political patch in six years since it returned to power . opposition parties stalled the last parliament session demanding the government must undertake a wider investigation into a $ 39 billion telecom license scandal .
addressing the party 's first plenary session , prime minister manmohan singh rejected allegations that he had turned a blind eye to the scandal and said he was ready to be questioned by a parliamentary panel , the public accounts committee , or pac , in the so-called 2g spectrum inquiry . commonwealth games bribery " i would like to state categorically that i have nothing to hide from the public at large .
that like caesar 's wife , the prime minister should be above suspicion , and it is for this reason that i am prepared to appear before the pac even though there is no precedent to that effect , " singh defended himself . bildunterschrift : the commonwealth games earlier this year were also marred by bribery allegations the prime minister also said the government was conducting a " thorough probe " into the commonwealth games organization and 2g spectrum allocation scandals , and no person found guilty would be spared .
in the 2g scam , second-generation telecom licenses were sold by the government for a fraction of their value .
several organizers of the commonwealth games , which were held in delhi in october , have been arrested for graft . attacking sonia gandhi a combative sonia gandhi took on the opposition bharatiya janata party : " it is also our duty to counter all the accusations that are blatantly baseless ; unfounded accusations being leveled by the opposition , particularly by the bjp . " the bjp , for its part , dismissed prime minister singh ’ s offer of appearing before the public accounts committee .
party spokesperson nirmala seetharaman said : " the speech that the president of the congress party has made clearly shows the mentality of a party which is under siege .
the president of the party , sonia gandhi has only tried to deflect the attention of the people of this country who are waiting to hear answers to so many of their failures . " ongoing investigation the opposition wants a joint parliamentary committee to investigate the 2g scandal because it would have the power to call cabinet members to testify .
the scandal has forced the former telecom minister a. raja to resign , although he has denied any wrongdoing . india ’ s supreme court has been holding hearings regularly on this issue , and is expected to rule shortly . author : murali krishnan -lrb- new delhi -rrb- editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but silent night – a song known the world over – has very humble origins . silent night 's roots can be traced back to the tiny village of oberndorf in the state of salzburg , austria .
it was written by priest , father joseph mohr , and in its original german form was called , " stille nacht , heilige nacht " , literally , " silent night , holy night . "
mohr 's lyrics were then set to music by schoolteacher franz xaver gruber and the song was first performed in the church of st. nicholas in oberndorf , austria during the christmas service of december 24th 1818 .
unlike the dreamy lullaby we know today , in its original incarnation it was an up-tempo dance tune .
all is calm , all is bright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silent night 's composers : father joseph mohr and franz xaver gruber as mohr 's written reminiscences make no mention of a source of inspiration for the song , its imagined origins have spawned a number of urban myths over the years .
one story has it that the organ in the church of st. nicholas was broken and so a new song had to be hastily written for a different instrument .
another , and perhaps more likely explanation , suggests that mohr simply wanted a new christmas song he could play on his guitar .
the song was translated into english in 1859 by john freeman young , second bishop for the episcopal diocese of florida , and quickly became a popular christmas standard both in religious services and with door-to-door carol singers .
during the 1914 world war i christmas truce , silent night was sung simultaneously by servicemen in english , french and german ; the only song soldiers on both sides of the front line had in common .
sleep in heavenly peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with tourists : the silent night memorial chapel in oberndorf over the decades the song has steadily gained popularity , and has been recorded time and again by pop artists such as the temptations , mahalia jackson and elvis presley .
they each added their own personal touches to the carol , and mahalia jackson ’ s lazy , blues-influenced version even holds the rather unusual honor of being one of the best-selling singles of all time … in norway .
since its first performance on that chilly christmas eve in 1818 , silent night has since been translated into 44 languages and remains , to this day , one of the world ’ s best known and beloved carols .

they 're not very good .
others combine poor performances with delusions of grandeur and animosity toward the world .
deutsche welle identifies the worst offenders . in goal many players pitch a hissy fit if they get benched , but ex-cologne keeper faryd mondragon took his tantrum to a previously unknown biblical level .
having been relieved of his starting role for poor performances and absence due to international duties , the colombian refused to play at all , and then held a press conference comparing his martyrdom to that of jesus .
cologne are apparently non-believers , shipping the malcontent messiah to philadelphia union in the mls .
cologne fans will be happy that faryd is mondra-gone .
the back line among the poor defenders , one particularly stands out .
germany 's leading football magazine , kicker , has ranked bremen 's mikael silvestre the worst player in the entire league , and he was a consensus choice for that distinction among the deutsche welle sport brain-trust as well .
the frenchman tries hard , but is clearly past his prime and was one major reason for bremen 's sputtering start .
bildunterschrift : silvestre ca n't keep up with the league 's youngsters paired with him in our porous central defense is gladbach 's anderson .
the 22-year-old brazilian was a major signing for the foals this summer , but he has " led " his new club to a truly laughable record of 47 goals conceded .
as dw sports writer nick amies succinctly put it ... " atrocious . "
on the flailing flanks , we have hamburg 's guy demel .
once a mainstay in northern germany , the ivorian has become , in the words of dw sports editor matt hermann , " a walking lapse in concentration . "
and not only has hamburg coach armin veh removed him from the starting line-up .
he did n't even make the bench in his club 's last match of the year .
joining him is bremen 's petri pasanen .
hamburg 's arch-rivals have always conceded lots of goals for a top side , but this year , the problem is worse than ever .
bremen 's goal difference is a lousy -12 .
opponents encounter little resistance on the wings , and the finnish veteran has simply not been up to the job .
the problem for bremen is that no one else has been , either .
the midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weather in germany has n't suited camoranesi , r among the candidates put forward for the middle of the pitch were bremen 's marko arnautovic and bayern 's franck ribery , but injuries have somewhat mitigated their poor production .
still , our mediocre midfield features some big names .
stuttgart 's mauro camaronesi has had a lot of highlights in his career , including winning the italian league title and the world cup .
but he 'll want to forget his time at stuttgart thus far .
brought in to great hoopla in the summer , he ca n't even make the starting line-up of a team that 's wintering in the drop zone .
matt put forward wolfsburg 's josue , a former team captain relegated to the bench , but dw sports writer jefferson chase overruled him in favor of the wolves ' diego .
when you pay some 18 million euros for a star with a history of excellence in the bundesliga , you expect more than a handful of goals with the odd assist thrown in .
the brazilian is also hot-headed and is very lucky not to have gotten sent off this season .
value for money is something else .
another playmaker who 's not making the grade is gladbach 's juan arango .
two goals , three assists and one very foolish red card that cost the foals a chance to get much needed points against hoffenheim are the venezuelan 's sad balance sheet .
as nick succinctly put it ... " atrocious . "
and lest anyone think we 're picking on foreigners , completing our flailing foursome is bremen 's aaron hunt .
the german youngster was charged with replacing mesut oezil this season , and he simply has n't been able to .
this may not be entirely his fault , as he was originally a wing striker and some problems adjusting to a new role could have been expected .
but one thing is already clear : a playmaker , he is not .
the forwards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobadilla may love gladbach , but he has n't done them any favors as everyone knows , strikers run hot and cold , so one player scoring more or less than another is often just a reflection of luck and form , and not a fundamental difference in quality .
in order to make the dw sports worst eleven , a forward had to do more than just not score .
he had to kick up a stink in the process .
for that reason , schalke 's edu gets a free pass , despite being nominated by matt .
ciprian marica , who earned a three-match ban late on , when stuttgart really needed him , attracted jefferson 's ire and almost earned a spot in the hall of shame .
but he still came up short .
that 's because matt made a persuasive argument for hamburg 's paolo guerrero , calling him " among the most delusionally self-important players in the league . "
rarely have fans been treated to so much pouting and gesticulating from a player who has a grand total of two goals to his credit after 17 games .
hamburg had great hopes for the peruvian when they brought him from bayern in 2006 - three-and-a-half years on there 's little doubt that he 's not going to fulfill them .
but even guerrero could n't top the histrionics of gladbach 's raul bobadilla .
apparently after taking anger-management lessons from diego maradona , the argentinian went on a rampage in the foals ' match against hanover in early december .
although his team were leading , bobadilla was so incensed in the first half that he lashed out physically at an opponent and verbally at an official , earning himself a straight red .
gladbach went on to lose the match , and bobilla has been suspended indefinitely .
not what your team needs in the struggle against the drop .
or as nick succinctly put it ... " just plain atrocious . "

"

the leader of the youth movement molody front was arrested for allegedly having beaten up someone .
dashkevich was one of the chief organizers of the opposition protest .
the situation was increasingly tense , especially after news broke that results of an official exit poll had been released saying that lukashenko could count on some 72 percent of the vote . ' long live belarus ' in october square , the opposition leaders derided the figures , saying that according to their information , the actual support for the president was not more than 30 percent .

" my thoughts and those of my friends are with the people in the square , " havel wrote .
" a free belarus must join the european union . " after havel 's words were read out , the crowd started to move in the direction of independence square , where the government and parliament buildings are located .

so many people are fed up with this dictatorship and have gone out into the streets to protest against this play which they call elections .
and yes , this is more or less what i had expected would happen . " in independence square , the only police presence was a car equipped with loudspeakers .
a voice warned the demonstrators that they should disperse or face harsh measures .
journalists were advised to get out of the way .
the crowd cheered at the sound of the church bells of the big red-brick roman catholic church in the square . riot police soon after , the mood changed .
riot police entered the square from adjacent streets .
the situation escalated when a group of youngsters tried unsuccessfully to force the entrance to the government building , in spite of calls from several presidential candidates not to do so and refrain from violent methods . in the hours that followed , the police cleared the square using batons and arresting hundreds of people , who were put in buses and taken in an unknown direction .
andrei sannikov and his wife were beaten up and arrested , as were other presidential candidates .
uniformed and plainclothes policemen detained youngsters as they were leaving the square .
several journalists were injured , and a russian television crew was briefly detained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukaschenko during the night , vladimir neklyayev was lifted from his hospital bed and taken away , as where vitaly rymashevsky and another candidate , grigory kostusev , who had been injured by police .

hundreds of arrests were made during the night in minsk . belarusian television viewers saw hardly anything of the events developing in the center of the capital .
a live talk show devoted to the elections focused on the election victory of alexander lukashenko , which was said to be close to 80 percent of the vote or more , with a turnout of around 80 percent .
viewers could call in to say whether they thought the elections were free and fair , and 94 percent of over 30,000 callers were said to have confirmed this . only briefly , some footage was shown of young people storming the parliament , and of riot police battling with demonstrators .
a high police officer present in the studio announced , under applause , that the square had been cleared and that " this small group " of demonstrators had been dispersed . author : geert groot koerkamp , minsk editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lord chief justice igor judge said that the use of " unobtrusive , hand held , virtually silent " equipment to give live text updates is unlikely to interfere with the administration of justice .
cameras and recording equipment are barred in british courts , but twitter has been a gray area .
" there is no statutory prohibition on the use of live text-based communications in open court , " the lord chief justice wrote in an interim practice guidance posted to the english judiciary website .

priority given to journalists clarifying the confusion england 's and wales ' most senior judicial official , igor judge , said priority would be given to journalists , but in general the use of twitter would be allowed in british courtrooms provided it did n't interfere with court proceedings .
reporting from british courts is tightly controlled , with television coverage and photography prohibited and sound recording allowed only in exceptional circumstances .
assange was freed last week on 200,000 pounds -lrb- 236,000 euros -rrb- bail after three high-profile court appearances .
the judiciary 's final rules will be issued after a consultation process , sometime in the forthcoming months .

germany 's world cup squad took the team prize . every year since 1947 , german sportswriters have cast their ballots on the sunday before christmas for the country 's athletes of the year .
in 2010 , the roughly 1,500 vote-casting journalists nominated two athletes who make their living at break-neck speed for the individual athletes of the year and a certain black and white soccer team who took third place at the world cup in south africa for the team award .
pedal to the metal for much of the year in germany , the biggest headlines to come from the world of formula one racing were about legendary driver michael schumacher 's return to the sport .
but the big news about schumacher was eclipsed at the end of the racing season by sebastian vettel , who won the drivers championship in the last race of the season and became the youngest champion in formula one history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel was welcomed back to germany as a hero for most of 2010 , vettel was in the running for the title and came into the final race in abu dhabi in third place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 20.12.2010 germany calls for an eu database of organic producers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a big market for organic produce following scandals over falsely labeled organic meat , germany wants the eu to set up a database of certified organic produce suppliers .
those in favor say such a system will provide greater transparency for consumers . in an effort to curb fraudulent abuse of organic labels , the german government is calling on the european commission to set up a europe-wide database of certified organic producers .
the database would be used to crack down on agents who have been using organic labels to sell conventional meat more expensively .
organic regulators would be obliged to immediately register any producer that failed a check .
" in case they withdraw a certificate , inspectors of organic food producers would immediately have to update the data base " , wolfgang reimer , in charge of organic agriculture at germany 's federal agricultural ministry , told the taz newspaper .
data sharing is vital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : licenses for organic producers can be forged or abused currently , databases are not " compulsory " and not all inspectors share their data .
private inspectors are commissioned by state authorities to check whether organic food producers stick to the european union 's regulations governing organic produce .
among other things , the rules require farmers to abstain from using many conventional pesticides as well as mineral fertilizers .
only if farmers adhere to these rules can they obtain organic certification .
yet these paper certificates are relatively easy to forge , and there have been several cases of fraud in recent months surrounding labeling of organic produce .
in september , a german poultry farmer from the western town of delbrueck was tried for mixing conventional meat with expensive organic meat .
the new system proposed by germany 's agriculture ministry would allow supermarket chains to check whether their suppliers were still certified to deliver organic produce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producers acknowledge that customers need more transparency no license , no business in a recent cross-border case , italian pig farmer paolo zaccardi continued using copies of his old certificate even after the authorities had withdrawn the license .
using false documents he was able to sell cheap conventional meat to german customers as high-quality organic food , which earned him at least one million euros .
" we 've asked the european commission to intervene in italy " , wolfgang reimer told the taz , adding that pressure needed to be intensified on italian authorities to solve the issue .
" we 've had problems with italy for quite some time now " , reimer said .
in many cases , he said , inspectors had found pesticide residue in italian food sold in germany under an organic label .
the european farmers ' umbrella group copa-cogeca generally welcomes the initiative : " we are in favor of all initiatives that improve transparency " , eva coral from copa-cogeca told deutsche welle .
copa-cogeca is also working on suggestions for making labelling easier for consumers in the european union , by synchronizing labels across the bloc .
" one thing is important when we think about new initiatives " , said coral , " we do n't want more paperwork for the producers .

advocates hope that the increased use of social networking will get younger europeans interested in what happens in brussels . public apathy is always a big problem for communicators in european union institutions . fewer than half of eligible voters turned out for ep elections in 2009 , continuing a decline that started 30 years ago . but there 's a new breed of european politicians who are tackling the problem of a public disconnect one keystroke at a time .
one of them is damien abad , a 30-year-old member of the european parliament , or mep .
the man from southeastern france says it 's time eu politicians stop just lamenting the lack of interest from constituents and do something about it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european members of parliament are slowly learning how to use facebook so , his idea is to teach his fellow meps what has come all too naturally for people of his generation - using social networking sites like facebook , flickr and twitter as a way to share a personal and informal view of the otherwise obscure european institutions .
" in order for european people to love europe they have to know europe ! "
abad explains .
and in order for european parliamentarians to tweet , they have to know twitter . so abad , who already communicates regularly in 140-character messages , set up a series of educational seminars for his fellow parliamentarians and their staffs to show how and why to use the new social technologies . he thinks it will catch on , but acknowledges , " it 's necessary for us to find the most active meps in order to create a buzz . "
most meps have never heard of twitter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy buzek calls social networking an " opportunity we need to seize . "
but abad 's got an uphill climb .
only about third to a half of members have a twitter account . a survey a year ago showed that 62 percent of parliamentarians had never even heard of twitter or had never used it and did n't intend to .
jerzy buzek , the parliamentary president and polish represntative has set a good example , opening his own twitter account at the beginning of this year . at age 60 , buzek proves it 's not just a technology for the young gadget-crazy crowd . he warmly addressed the first social-media training session , encouraging participation .
" web 2.0 constitutes for us politicians an opportunity we need to seize , " he said in a pre-recorded video message , shown at one of the workshops held earlier this month in brussels .
" with facebook , twitter and other 2.0 tools , we can get reach out to our citizens on a daily , almost personal basis .
i see it every day through my facebook and twitter accounts . "
the keynote lecturer at that same workshop day was vincent ducrey , a well-known online consultant , who advises the french government on its social media policies and has written a book called the " guide of influence . "
ducrey has worked out meticulous models of the 24-hour news cycle and precisely how to use it for maximum messaging effect .
he said technophobe meps should just get over it , for everybody 's sake , not least their own .
" it 's not about a special party , it 's about democracy , " ducrey insists .
" if we want a high level of participation a high level of voters in three years , they need to start to interact , to raise the question of europe as soon as possible .
and twitter is a good way to do it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 62 percent of meps have never heard of twitter connecting person-to-person ducrey says politicians should learn to be tactical but also personable , and should never have an assistant writing their tweets .
one of the believers who 's urging her colleagues to hop on board is marietje schaake , a dutch mep who says she would n't be in brussels at all if it were n't for social media .
she says with a miniscule campaign budget in 2009 , virtually all the outreach in her campaign was , well , virtual .
" obviously you have an idea , " she said .
" people believe in the idea and in you as a person but to reach them and to interact with them and to make sure they know about you , it could only happen through the internet . "
there are others who 've been on the same wavelength , so to speak , for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : member of the european parliament are generally skeptical of social networking europatweets was a service formed during the 2009 parliamentary elections to distribute information regarding the vote .
it has continued and expanded with its partners into a new service called " tweet your mep " in september . the principle here , said belgian co-creator henri lastenouse , is to provoke conversation , for voters to feel their elected representatives are accountable to them and for the whole world to see if they are not , by looking at the public twitter accounts .
lastenouse predicts public officials will increasingly be forced to take this platform seriously .
they 'll also have to adjust to not being in complete control of what happens , lastenouse says , as they are when they just maintain a website and post items to it .
lastenouse says he 's looking forward to the day when the european commissioners are also pressed into keeping twitter accounts and citizens will be able to ask questions directly to , for example , commission president jose manuel barroso .
" with social media , it 's open and that 's a problem because they will have to answer the questions , " he warned .

advocates hope that the increased use of social networking will get younger europeans interested in what happens in brussels . public apathy is always a big problem for communicators in european union institutions . fewer than half of eligible voters turned out for ep elections in 2009 , continuing a decline that started 30 years ago . but there 's a new breed of european politicians who are tackling the problem of a public disconnect one keystroke at a time .
one of them is damien abad , a 30-year-old member of the european parliament , or mep .
the man from southeastern france says it 's time eu politicians stop just lamenting the lack of interest from constituents and do something about it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european members of parliament are slowly learning how to use facebook so , his idea is to teach his fellow meps what has come all too naturally for people of his generation - using social networking sites like facebook , flickr and twitter as a way to share a personal and informal view of the otherwise obscure european institutions .
" in order for european people to love europe they have to know europe ! "
abad explains .
and in order for european parliamentarians to tweet , they have to know twitter . so abad , who already communicates regularly in 140-character messages , set up a series of educational seminars for his fellow parliamentarians and their staffs to show how and why to use the new social technologies . he thinks it will catch on , but acknowledges , " it 's necessary for us to find the most active meps in order to create a buzz . "
most meps have never heard of twitter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy buzek calls social networking an " opportunity we need to seize . "
but abad 's got an uphill climb .
only about third to a half of members have a twitter account . a survey a year ago showed that 62 percent of parliamentarians had never even heard of twitter or had never used it and did n't intend to .
jerzy buzek , the parliamentary president and polish represntative has set a good example , opening his own twitter account at the beginning of this year . at age 60 , buzek proves it 's not just a technology for the young gadget-crazy crowd . he warmly addressed the first social-media training session , encouraging participation .
" web 2.0 constitutes for us politicians an opportunity we need to seize , " he said in a pre-recorded video message , shown at one of the workshops held earlier this month in brussels .
" with facebook , twitter and other 2.0 tools , we can get reach out to our citizens on a daily , almost personal basis .
i see it every day through my facebook and twitter accounts . "
the keynote lecturer at that same workshop day was vincent ducrey , a well-known online consultant , who advises the french government on its social media policies and has written a book called the " guide of influence . "

the ensemble is gearing up for its 40th anniversary but looks back on a history that has had its share of challenges . a swallow interrupts its journey to pass through a family 's house on new year 's day , bringing them wealth and prosperity for the coming year .
that 's an image from a ukrainian folk song called " shchedryk , " known to ears in the english-speaking world by way of peter wihousky 's holiday adaptation : the " carol of the bells . " the folk song is also the namesake of one of ukraine 's most famous groups of young singers , the shchedryk children 's choir .
the singers have won awards throughout the world , and in 2005 they even performed with the pope in audience . like in the song from which the ensemble takes its name , the new year marks a special turning point for the shchedryk children 's choir .
the group celebrates its 40th anniversary in 2011 . political challenges the children 's ensemble got its start in 1971 , founded by the well-known ukrainian choirmaster iryna mykolayivna sablina .
her goal was to offer a contrast to the idealized image of soviet childhood that many other youth ensembles in her country promoted . instead , she focused on the classical repertoire and aimed to develop the artistic and musical sensibilities of the children she conducted .
but those goals were n't viewed favorably by ukrainian authorities , said her husband , conductor roman kofman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international tours are nothing new for the group , which sung at the 2010 beethovenfest " i must say , iryna is a woman who never compromises and she sometimes got into difficulties when it comes to cultural politics , " kofman explained .
" the cultural committee summoned her and said of their repertoire , ' songs about lenin - none .
songs about the party - none .
songs about the homeland - none .
songs by western european composers - 197 .
songs by russian composers - also nearly 100 .
what do you have to say for yourself ? " ' kofman said his wife replied : " i have a responsibility to the parents for the aesthetic education of these children .
give me songs about lenin or the party of the same musical standard as a bach cantata or a song by rachmaninov - but they just do n't exist . " into the future the political challenges of the 1970s and 80s are now history for the orchestra , and a new but familiar face is at the podium .
iryna sablina retired from conducting the group in 2004 , and her daughter , marianna sablina , has now taken charge . around 50 members make up the choir , but not all of them go on tour .
international appearances are reserved for the best singers within the ensemble . " the choristers are selected according to strict qualitative criteria and come from all levels of society , " marianna sablina explained , adding that they meet three times a week to practice . " their repertoire still draws from classic western and russian composers , but also includes ukrainian folk music traditions . have a listen to the live recordings below to hear some festive selections sung by the shchedryk children 's choir at a deutsche welle concerto discreto concert in bonn . author : inge ivanovic -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 20.12.2010 berlin 's christmas markets try to trade cheer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has no shortage of christmas markets facing a terror warning , a slowly recovering economy , and drastic weather , berlin 's more than 50 christmas markets are dealing with more challenges than usual this year . booth lights twinkle , children 's rides whirl and spin , and carols rings out from overhead loudspeakers at the city weihnachtsmarkt in the western part of berlin .
welcoming and hopeful faces manning the christmas stands still hope for customers despite this year 's terror warning , icy rain , and swirling snowstorms .
johanna sievers is one of them .
the young student is working for the first time at a traditional christmas market . her booth sells treats imported from the provence region in southern france , including rich almond studded nougat , caramels and chocolates . the newly opened gourmet shop she 's working for hopes to attract more customers through its booth . terror warning but after a government-issued terror warning was released at the end of november , along with news reports that christmas markets might be targeted , some of sievers ' friends expressed concerns about her job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sievers is n't letting security concerns get her down “ when i say i 'm working in a christmas market , many say ' oh my god , really ? ' and they are worried .
i 'm worried too , a little bit , ” she admits .
“ well , the world 's a dangerous place , so why not go to a christmas market ?
you can cross the street and get run over .
that 's actually more likely . ”
many christmas markets are trying to calm fears with a visible police presence and non-uniformed security personnel making their rounds to keep everyone happy - and shopping . as a norwegian tourist picks up a tiny bag of chocolate-covered figs , sievers makes sure to point out the price , 5 euros , explaining that people usually balk at paying that amount for the small bag of handcrafted french sweets .
unfazed , the tourist adds it to her order and also tells sievers to keep the change , not common behavior for berliners .
across town in prenzlauer berg 's scandinavian-themed lucia weihnachtsmarkt , bilgec serdaroglu is charming customers with his friendly demeanor and tasty hand-made goods .
a small but steady stream of customers stops at his stand to taste mustards flavored with whiskey , chilli and even licorice .
he also has vinegars and preserves .
most of his wares are priced at an affordable 2.50 euros . bildunterschrift : private security guards maintain a visible presence at berlin 's markets first rain , then snow serdaroglu , who moved to berlin from hamburg , has been selling at the market for six years , but this is the first year he is at the market with his own company .
he 's excited . still , serdaroglu admits people in the city have a tight grip on their wallets .
" berlin is the capital , but the sad part is that it 's the weakest city economically , " he says .
people have difficulties with money , he adds , and going to the christmas market definitely means spending money . " if i take my children to the christmas market , i have to plan on spending an average of 50 euros , " serdaroglu says .
" can i afford it or not ?
that 's the question .
so i can understand when people are holding back a bit . "
open air markets like this one also suffer from the weather .
first came the rain at the end of november , followed by surprising amounts of snow , which cancelled flights and delayed trains , slowing down locals and tourists alike .
and while visitors to berlin 's christmas markets seem to be taking the terror warnings and weather surprises in stride , they are n't all whipping out their cash .
stands selling hot drinks , snacks and affordable gifts are doing well , but some merchants offering jewelry , pottery and other higher priced items gaze out from their unvisited booths looking bored and frustrated . browsing but not buying from a spot next to a wood-burning stove , visitor frank huehn watches the crowd slowly pass by a stand selling felted boots from switzerland .
many people stop to look and warm their hands , but few purchase the shoes , which cost over 100 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of browsing but not enough buying at stands , merchants say .
huehn , a merchant himself , is n't selling his own sheepskin goods at this christmas market or any other .
“ the question is n't just how many people come and walk around the market ; vendors are interested in how many are shopping , " he says .
" the market can be very busy , with people exhibiting their wares , and visitors browsing , but they are n't necessarily buying anything . "
the rent at holiday markets , huehn argues , is too high for an unpredictable payoff .
committing for the full run of the season is too risky ; he prefers to try his luck at weekly local markets instead . in the last few years , things have changed for small sellers of handmade goods , partly because of the financial crisis and partly because of a new mindset in germany , according to huehn .
“ in my opinion , a majority of today 's 25 and 30-year-olds just do n't have a sense for quality in products and materials , " he says .
" they do n't work with their hands anymore , so they have no idea - they ca n't judge the quality . they just decide on the price . the older people can tell - they can pick something up in their hands and feel the quality , and they 're ready to pay for it .
the young people ca n't . it 's an unfortunate development . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 20.12.2010 techno-skeptic parliamentarians trained to use twitter , facebook großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damien abad , an mep from france , loves twitter a young french member of the european parliament is leading the charge .
advocates hope that the increased use of social networking will get younger europeans interested in what happens in brussels . public apathy is always a big problem for communicators in european union institutions . fewer than half of eligible voters turned out for ep elections in 2009 , continuing a decline that started 30 years ago . but there 's a new breed of european politicians who are tackling the problem of a public disconnect one keystroke at a time .
one of them is damien abad , a 30-year-old member of the european parliament , or mep .
the man from southeastern france says it 's time eu politicians stop just lamenting the lack of interest from constituents and do something about it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european members of parliament are slowly learning how to use facebook so , his idea is to teach his fellow meps what has come all too naturally for people of his generation - using social networking sites like facebook , flickr and twitter as a way to share a personal and informal view of the otherwise obscure european institutions .
" in order for european people to love europe they have to know europe ! "
abad explains .
and in order for european parliamentarians to tweet , they have to know twitter . so abad , who already communicates regularly in 140-character messages , set up a series of educational seminars for his fellow parliamentarians and their staffs to show how and why to use the new social technologies . he thinks it will catch on , but acknowledges , " it 's necessary for us to find the most active meps in order to create a buzz . "
most meps have never heard of twitter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy buzek calls social networking an " opportunity we need to seize . "
but abad 's got an uphill climb .
only about third to a half of members have a twitter account . a survey a year ago showed that 62 percent of parliamentarians had never even heard of twitter or had never used it and did n't intend to .
jerzy buzek , the parliamentary president and polish represntative has set a good example , opening his own twitter account at the beginning of this year . at age 60 , buzek proves it 's not just a technology for the young gadget-crazy crowd . he warmly addressed the first social-media training session , encouraging participation .
" web 2.0 constitutes for us politicians an opportunity we need to seize , " he said in a pre-recorded video message , shown at one of the workshops held earlier this month in brussels .
" with facebook , twitter and other 2.0 tools , we can get reach out to our citizens on a daily , almost personal basis .
i see it every day through my facebook and twitter accounts . "
the keynote lecturer at that same workshop day was vincent ducrey , a well-known online consultant , who advises the french government on its social media policies and has written a book called the " guide of influence . "
ducrey has worked out meticulous models of the 24-hour news cycle and precisely how to use it for maximum messaging effect .
he said technophobe meps should just get over it , for everybody 's sake , not least their own .
" it 's not about a special party , it 's about democracy , " ducrey insists .
" if we want a high level of participation a high level of voters in three years , they need to start to interact , to raise the question of europe as soon as possible .
and twitter is a good way to do it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 62 percent of meps have never heard of twitter connecting person-to-person ducrey says politicians should learn to be tactical but also personable , and should never have an assistant writing their tweets .
one of the believers who 's urging her colleagues to hop on board is marietje schaake , a dutch mep who says she would n't be in brussels at all if it were n't for social media .
she says with a miniscule campaign budget in 2009 , virtually all the outreach in her campaign was , well , virtual .
" obviously you have an idea , " she said .
" people believe in the idea and in you as a person but to reach them and to interact with them and to make sure they know about you , it could only happen through the internet . "
there are others who 've been on the same wavelength , so to speak , for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : member of the european parliament are generally skeptical of social networking europatweets was a service formed during the 2009 parliamentary elections to distribute information regarding the vote .
it has continued and expanded with its partners into a new service called " tweet your mep " in september . the principle here , said belgian co-creator henri lastenouse , is to provoke conversation , for voters to feel their elected representatives are accountable to them and for the whole world to see if they are not , by looking at the public twitter accounts .
lastenouse predicts public officials will increasingly be forced to take this platform seriously .
they 'll also have to adjust to not being in complete control of what happens , lastenouse says , as they are when they just maintain a website and post items to it .
lastenouse says he 's looking forward to the day when the european commissioners are also pressed into keeping twitter accounts and citizens will be able to ask questions directly to , for example , commission president jose manuel barroso .
" with social media , it 's open and that 's a problem because they will have to answer the questions , " he warned .

the adeptly staged polls were meant to simulate liberalisation without allowing any real democratic change to take place .
this political farce was by no means directed at belarus 's citizens , but at the european public .
after all , the european union has taken a step towards belarus these past months .
but only the ignorant could be surprised and disappointed at the outcome of the election and the brutal oppression of the opposition : anyone who is familiar with the situation in belarus has long been aware of the kind of regime lukashenko has built over the past 16 years .
and they are also aware of the administrative resources the regime used to ensure an outcome of more than 70 percent - an result more or less predicted by lukashenko .
one should n't be under any illusions about lukashenko : there will never be any real democratic reforms in belarus with him in power .
staged for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel those who now demand an end to europe 's dialogue with lukashenko may prove their moral superiority , but at the same time they make clear that they know nothing about belarus .
it may be difficult to understand , but the eu is right to continue its dialogue with the lukashenko regime despite election fraud and the arrest of hundreds of opposition leaders .
the past 15 years have shown that breaking off talks and isolation are not the solution .
but within the framework of dialogue there must also be room for criticism .
deficits in human and civil rights must be addressed .
the eu 's high representative for foreign affairs , catherine ashton , is right to demand the immediate release of the detained opposition leaders .
split post-soviet society the social situation in belarus is another reason for maintaining this dialogue .
like in most post-soviet states , society there is deeply split : the vast majority of the population are apolitical and simply endure authoritarian policies .
the total political and economic demise that came as a result of the soviet union 's collapse 20 years ago has left its traumatic mark on society and robbed many people of the hope that political change is possible at all .
the fact that the opposition candidates in belarus were so handily defeated must also be due to the fact that their campaigns were so limited and that they were up against the government 's administrative resources .
but it was also due to the fact that people do n't trust them to do a better job than lukashenko and his regime .
only a relatively small part of society advocates political change : mainly well-educated citizens , intellectuals , small business owners and many students , most of whom live in minsk and other large cities .
yesterday in minsk , they took to the streets to support the opposition .
these people want a democratic belarus in europe .
to ensure that their numbers grow in the long term , they should be supported by a relaxing of visa restrictions , granting small consumer loans via the european bank for reconstruction and development as well as civilian projects and cooperation in the educational sector . and that can only be done through dialogue with lukashenko 's regime .

but many observers on the ground say that not much has changed for the better . the dutch researcher and afghanistan expert alex strick van linschoten is one of the few westerners who live in kandahar . he is the co-editor of ' my life with the taliban , ' a book about mullah abdul salam zaeef , the taliban ’ s ambassador to pakistan in 2001 .
he 's currently working on a study on the links between the taliban and al-qaeda , which will be published in conjunction with the center on international cooperation , new york university . deutsche welle : the us troop surge has been visible in the south of afghanistan since the spring of 2010 .
what effect has it had so far on kandahar ? alex strick van linschoten : in some ways , nothing has changed .
there have been foreign troops in and outside kandahar city for several years .
but there are some cosmetic shifts .
you have a lot of traffic jams in the city now .
before , there used to be mainly canadian troops in kandahar , and they would drive around the city so that they would n't cause traffic jams .
this helped to protect them -lrb- as well as locals in the area -rrb- from being hit by ieds -lrb- improvised explosive devices -rrb- .
but now the americans drive straight through the city .
so when an ied goes off , people blame the americans for driving through .
they do n't blame the taliban for placing the bomb .
you also have much more air traffic compared to the last year .
what is the population 's reaction to the conflict ? there are all sorts of things that resonate badly with the people .
i spoke to a cameraman who was embedded with the us troops in arghandab district for a documentary .
he mentioned the case of a us commander who went to a village telling the elders , " you have to show us where all the ieds and mines are , in and around your village .
if not , i 'm going to bombard your village . "
the elders said , " we do n't know where they are . " the local population feels reminded of the soviet times , when there was a concept of collective responsibility as well - something actually forbidden by the 1949 geneva convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war .
how would you describe the situation in kandahar ? people are depressed .
the younger ones are trying to leave .
just a few days ago , two deputy directors of departments were assassinated .
anyone who works for the government is being threatened .
the taliban now have a commission in the city calling on people to leave their jobs .
they know exactly who is doing what .
there is no way that the afghan government or the americans can protect all the people .
the military certainly ca n't pay enough for civilians to risk their lives for a government that no one really believes is going to survive in the present form .
how do the taliban operate in town ? they have a mediation commission .
when you get a ' night letter ' , for example from the taliban , warning the locals not to work with what the taliban call the occupiers , you can object to this letter , arguing that you have n't done anything wrong .
it is their own ' hearts and minds ' campaign .
on the other hand , i do n't see too much of the ideological side in kandahar .
yes , islam is a motivating factor for the insurgency , but i never really found that islam was the main motivating factor for the taliban in the south .
there are many other factors that people think of and talk about before islam .
the us military and government say that they have gained ' momentum ' and that they see progress ... my sense is that general petraeus thinks that he can win the war militarily .
i think he may be overestimating his ability to achieve this goal , and underestimating at the same time the effect it has on the taliban .
i do n't think petraeus has a serious interest in a settlement that sees the taliban as a part of afghan society .
was the strategy of petraeus ' predecessor more promising ? compared to petraeus , mcchrystal seemed like he understood things far better and had a better appreciation of the effects of us military actions .
you can see it in the number of night raids .
when you look at the isaf statistics , about the day after petraeus arrived there was a massive spike in night raids .
petraeus has also restarted the air war .
in november , compared to the last year , three times as many bombs were dropped on afghanistan . to what extent is the western and afghan military strategy hurting the taliban ?
how do they react ? the night raids certainly have an effect .
they catch or kill a lot of them .
but it does n't seem to have either irrevocably damaged their morale or their ability to carry out attacks .
there does n't seem to be a change in the number of assassinations in the city .
it is tough for the taliban , but they will come back in spring and start all over again . some argue that the taliban are about to change and possibly get more radical as a result of the war .
do you agree ? you can see it in terms of their tactics in the number of beheadings .
that would not have happened before .
it is the same in terms of their attitude to authority , killing elders for example , and also talking back to quetta , the senior leadership , in not being completely subservient to them .
you see it in the general fragmentation also : the taliban shadow governor in kandahar city does n't have control over all taliban groups any more .
a lot of civilian killings in the city are n't ordered from quetta . they often comes from small groups .
some may be pushed by pakistan .
but you have a lot more voices now than before .
what does that mean for the months ahead ? the worry , of course , is that all of these things may eventually lead to a sort of taliban that will look more to an international ' jihad ' with younger people in charge on the side of the insurgency , who have only lived in conflict and war , and who do n't even remember the old afghanistan , or the meaning of peace , from before the soviet war .

but many observers on the ground say that not much has changed for the better . the dutch researcher and afghanistan expert alex strick van linschoten is one of the few westerners who live in kandahar . he is the co-editor of ' my life with the taliban , ' a book about mullah abdul salam zaeef , the taliban ’ s ambassador to pakistan in 2001 .
he 's currently working on a study on the links between the taliban and al-qaeda , which will be published in conjunction with the center on international cooperation , new york university . deutsche welle : the us troop surge has been visible in the south of afghanistan since the spring of 2010 .
what effect has it had so far on kandahar ? alex strick van linschoten : in some ways , nothing has changed .
there have been foreign troops in and outside kandahar city for several years .
but there are some cosmetic shifts .
you have a lot of traffic jams in the city now .
before , there used to be mainly canadian troops in kandahar , and they would drive around the city so that they would n't cause traffic jams .
this helped to protect them -lrb- as well as locals in the area -rrb- from being hit by ieds -lrb- improvised explosive devices -rrb- .
but now the americans drive straight through the city .
so when an ied goes off , people blame the americans for driving through .
they do n't blame the taliban for placing the bomb .
you also have much more air traffic compared to the last year .
what is the population 's reaction to the conflict ? there are all sorts of things that resonate badly with the people .
i spoke to a cameraman who was embedded with the us troops in arghandab district for a documentary .
he mentioned the case of a us commander who went to a village telling the elders , " you have to show us where all the ieds and mines are , in and around your village .
if not , i 'm going to bombard your village . "
the elders said , " we do n't know where they are . " the local population feels reminded of the soviet times , when there was a concept of collective responsibility as well - something actually forbidden by the 1949 geneva convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war .
how would you describe the situation in kandahar ? people are depressed .
the younger ones are trying to leave .
just a few days ago , two deputy directors of departments were assassinated .
anyone who works for the government is being threatened .
the taliban now have a commission in the city calling on people to leave their jobs .
they know exactly who is doing what .
there is no way that the afghan government or the americans can protect all the people .
the military certainly ca n't pay enough for civilians to risk their lives for a government that no one really believes is going to survive in the present form .
how do the taliban operate in town ? they have a mediation commission .
when you get a ' night letter ' , for example from the taliban , warning the locals not to work with what the taliban call the occupiers , you can object to this letter , arguing that you have n't done anything wrong .
it is their own ' hearts and minds ' campaign .
on the other hand , i do n't see too much of the ideological side in kandahar .
yes , islam is a motivating factor for the insurgency , but i never really found that islam was the main motivating factor for the taliban in the south .
there are many other factors that people think of and talk about before islam .
the us military and government say that they have gained ' momentum ' and that they see progress ... my sense is that general petraeus thinks that he can win the war militarily .
i think he may be overestimating his ability to achieve this goal , and underestimating at the same time the effect it has on the taliban .
i do n't think petraeus has a serious interest in a settlement that sees the taliban as a part of afghan society .
was the strategy of petraeus ' predecessor more promising ? compared to petraeus , mcchrystal seemed like he understood things far better and had a better appreciation of the effects of us military actions .
you can see it in the number of night raids .
when you look at the isaf statistics , about the day after petraeus arrived there was a massive spike in night raids .
petraeus has also restarted the air war .
in november , compared to the last year , three times as many bombs were dropped on afghanistan . to what extent is the western and afghan military strategy hurting the taliban ?
how do they react ? the night raids certainly have an effect .
they catch or kill a lot of them .
but it does n't seem to have either irrevocably damaged their morale or their ability to carry out attacks .
there does n't seem to be a change in the number of assassinations in the city .
it is tough for the taliban , but they will come back in spring and start all over again . some argue that the taliban are about to change and possibly get more radical as a result of the war .
do you agree ? you can see it in terms of their tactics in the number of beheadings .
that would not have happened before .
it is the same in terms of their attitude to authority , killing elders for example , and also talking back to quetta , the senior leadership , in not being completely subservient to them .
you see it in the general fragmentation also : the taliban shadow governor in kandahar city does n't have control over all taliban groups any more .
a lot of civilian killings in the city are n't ordered from quetta . they often comes from small groups .
some may be pushed by pakistan .
but you have a lot more voices now than before .
what does that mean for the months ahead ? the worry , of course , is that all of these things may eventually lead to a sort of taliban that will look more to an international ' jihad ' with younger people in charge on the side of the insurgency , who have only lived in conflict and war , and who do n't even remember the old afghanistan , or the meaning of peace , from before the soviet war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 20.12.2010 berlin 's christmas markets try to trade cheer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has no shortage of christmas markets facing a terror warning , a slowly recovering economy , and drastic weather , berlin 's more than 50 christmas markets are dealing with more challenges than usual this year . booth lights twinkle , children 's rides whirl and spin , and carols rings out from overhead loudspeakers at the city weihnachtsmarkt in the western part of berlin .
welcoming and hopeful faces manning the christmas stands still hope for customers despite this year 's terror warning , icy rain , and swirling snowstorms .
johanna sievers is one of them .
the young student is working for the first time at a traditional christmas market . her booth sells treats imported from the provence region in southern france , including rich almond studded nougat , caramels and chocolates . the newly opened gourmet shop she 's working for hopes to attract more customers through its booth . terror warning but after a government-issued terror warning was released at the end of november , along with news reports that christmas markets might be targeted , some of sievers ' friends expressed concerns about her job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sievers is n't letting security concerns get her down “ when i say i 'm working in a christmas market , many say ' oh my god , really ? ' and they are worried .
i 'm worried too , a little bit , ” she admits .
“ well , the world 's a dangerous place , so why not go to a christmas market ?
you can cross the street and get run over .
that 's actually more likely . ”
many christmas markets are trying to calm fears with a visible police presence and non-uniformed security personnel making their rounds to keep everyone happy - and shopping . as a norwegian tourist picks up a tiny bag of chocolate-covered figs , sievers makes sure to point out the price , 5 euros , explaining that people usually balk at paying that amount for the small bag of handcrafted french sweets .
unfazed , the tourist adds it to her order and also tells sievers to keep the change , not common behavior for berliners .
across town in prenzlauer berg 's scandinavian-themed lucia weihnachtsmarkt , bilgec serdaroglu is charming customers with his friendly demeanor and tasty hand-made goods .
a small but steady stream of customers stops at his stand to taste mustards flavored with whiskey , chilli and even licorice .
he also has vinegars and preserves .
most of his wares are priced at an affordable 2.50 euros . bildunterschrift : private security guards maintain a visible presence at berlin 's markets first rain , then snow serdaroglu , who moved to berlin from hamburg , has been selling at the market for six years , but this is the first year he is at the market with his own company .
he 's excited . still , serdaroglu admits people in the city have a tight grip on their wallets .
" berlin is the capital , but the sad part is that it 's the weakest city economically , " he says .
people have difficulties with money , he adds , and going to the christmas market definitely means spending money . " if i take my children to the christmas market , i have to plan on spending an average of 50 euros , " serdaroglu says .
" can i afford it or not ?
that 's the question .
so i can understand when people are holding back a bit . "
open air markets like this one also suffer from the weather .
first came the rain at the end of november , followed by surprising amounts of snow , which cancelled flights and delayed trains , slowing down locals and tourists alike .
and while visitors to berlin 's christmas markets seem to be taking the terror warnings and weather surprises in stride , they are n't all whipping out their cash .
stands selling hot drinks , snacks and affordable gifts are doing well , but some merchants offering jewelry , pottery and other higher priced items gaze out from their unvisited booths looking bored and frustrated . browsing but not buying from a spot next to a wood-burning stove , visitor frank huehn watches the crowd slowly pass by a stand selling felted boots from switzerland .
many people stop to look and warm their hands , but few purchase the shoes , which cost over 100 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of browsing but not enough buying at stands , merchants say .
huehn , a merchant himself , is n't selling his own sheepskin goods at this christmas market or any other .
“ the question is n't just how many people come and walk around the market ; vendors are interested in how many are shopping , " he says .
" the market can be very busy , with people exhibiting their wares , and visitors browsing , but they are n't necessarily buying anything . "
the rent at holiday markets , huehn argues , is too high for an unpredictable payoff .
committing for the full run of the season is too risky ; he prefers to try his luck at weekly local markets instead . in the last few years , things have changed for small sellers of handmade goods , partly because of the financial crisis and partly because of a new mindset in germany , according to huehn .
“ in my opinion , a majority of today 's 25 and 30-year-olds just do n't have a sense for quality in products and materials , " he says .
" they do n't work with their hands anymore , so they have no idea - they ca n't judge the quality . they just decide on the price . the older people can tell - they can pick something up in their hands and feel the quality , and they 're ready to pay for it .
the young people ca n't . it 's an unfortunate development . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 20.12.2010 techno-skeptic parliamentarians trained to use twitter , facebook großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damien abad , an mep from france , loves twitter a young french member of the european parliament is leading the charge .
advocates hope that the increased use of social networking will get younger europeans interested in what happens in brussels . public apathy is always a big problem for communicators in european union institutions . fewer than half of eligible voters turned out for ep elections in 2009 , continuing a decline that started 30 years ago . but there 's a new breed of european politicians who are tackling the problem of a public disconnect one keystroke at a time .
one of them is damien abad , a 30-year-old member of the european parliament , or mep .
the man from southeastern france says it 's time eu politicians stop just lamenting the lack of interest from constituents and do something about it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european members of parliament are slowly learning how to use facebook so , his idea is to teach his fellow meps what has come all too naturally for people of his generation - using social networking sites like facebook , flickr and twitter as a way to share a personal and informal view of the otherwise obscure european institutions .
" in order for european people to love europe they have to know europe ! "
abad explains .
and in order for european parliamentarians to tweet , they have to know twitter . so abad , who already communicates regularly in 140-character messages , set up a series of educational seminars for his fellow parliamentarians and their staffs to show how and why to use the new social technologies . he thinks it will catch on , but acknowledges , " it 's necessary for us to find the most active meps in order to create a buzz . "
most meps have never heard of twitter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy buzek calls social networking an " opportunity we need to seize . "
but abad 's got an uphill climb .
only about third to a half of members have a twitter account . a survey a year ago showed that 62 percent of parliamentarians had never even heard of twitter or had never used it and did n't intend to .
jerzy buzek , the parliamentary president and polish represntative has set a good example , opening his own twitter account at the beginning of this year . at age 60 , buzek proves it 's not just a technology for the young gadget-crazy crowd . he warmly addressed the first social-media training session , encouraging participation .
" web 2.0 constitutes for us politicians an opportunity we need to seize , " he said in a pre-recorded video message , shown at one of the workshops held earlier this month in brussels .
" with facebook , twitter and other 2.0 tools , we can get reach out to our citizens on a daily , almost personal basis .
i see it every day through my facebook and twitter accounts . "
the keynote lecturer at that same workshop day was vincent ducrey , a well-known online consultant , who advises the french government on its social media policies and has written a book called the " guide of influence . "
ducrey has worked out meticulous models of the 24-hour news cycle and precisely how to use it for maximum messaging effect .
he said technophobe meps should just get over it , for everybody 's sake , not least their own .
" it 's not about a special party , it 's about democracy , " ducrey insists .
" if we want a high level of participation a high level of voters in three years , they need to start to interact , to raise the question of europe as soon as possible .
and twitter is a good way to do it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 62 percent of meps have never heard of twitter connecting person-to-person ducrey says politicians should learn to be tactical but also personable , and should never have an assistant writing their tweets .
one of the believers who 's urging her colleagues to hop on board is marietje schaake , a dutch mep who says she would n't be in brussels at all if it were n't for social media .
she says with a miniscule campaign budget in 2009 , virtually all the outreach in her campaign was , well , virtual .
" obviously you have an idea , " she said .
" people believe in the idea and in you as a person but to reach them and to interact with them and to make sure they know about you , it could only happen through the internet . "
there are others who 've been on the same wavelength , so to speak , for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : member of the european parliament are generally skeptical of social networking europatweets was a service formed during the 2009 parliamentary elections to distribute information regarding the vote .
it has continued and expanded with its partners into a new service called " tweet your mep " in september . the principle here , said belgian co-creator henri lastenouse , is to provoke conversation , for voters to feel their elected representatives are accountable to them and for the whole world to see if they are not , by looking at the public twitter accounts .
lastenouse predicts public officials will increasingly be forced to take this platform seriously .
they 'll also have to adjust to not being in complete control of what happens , lastenouse says , as they are when they just maintain a website and post items to it .
lastenouse says he 's looking forward to the day when the european commissioners are also pressed into keeping twitter accounts and citizens will be able to ask questions directly to , for example , commission president jose manuel barroso .
" with social media , it 's open and that 's a problem because they will have to answer the questions , " he warned .

the singers have won awards throughout the world , and in 2005 they even performed with the pope in audience . like in the song from which the ensemble takes its name , the new year marks a special turning point for the shchedryk children 's choir .
the group celebrates its 40th anniversary in 2011 . political challenges the children 's ensemble got its start in 1971 , founded by the well-known ukrainian choirmaster iryna mykolayivna sablina .
her goal was to offer a contrast to the idealized image of soviet childhood that many other youth ensembles in her country promoted . instead , she focused on the classical repertoire and aimed to develop the artistic and musical sensibilities of the children she conducted .
but those goals were n't viewed favorably by ukrainian authorities , said her husband , conductor roman kofman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international tours are nothing new for the group , which sung at the 2010 beethovenfest " i must say , iryna is a woman who never compromises and she sometimes got into difficulties when it comes to cultural politics , " kofman explained .
" the cultural committee summoned her and said of their repertoire , ' songs about lenin - none .
songs about the party - none .
songs about the homeland - none .
songs by western european composers - 197 .
songs by russian composers - also nearly 100 .
what do you have to say for yourself ? " ' kofman said his wife replied : " i have a responsibility to the parents for the aesthetic education of these children .
give me songs about lenin or the party of the same musical standard as a bach cantata or a song by rachmaninov - but they just do n't exist . " into the future the political challenges of the 1970s and 80s are now history for the orchestra , and a new but familiar face is at the podium .
iryna sablina retired from conducting the group in 2004 , and her daughter , marianna sablina , has now taken charge . around 50 members make up the choir , but not all of them go on tour .
international appearances are reserved for the best singers within the ensemble . " the choristers are selected according to strict qualitative criteria and come from all levels of society , " marianna sablina explained , adding that they meet three times a week to practice . " their repertoire still draws from classic western and russian composers , but also includes ukrainian folk music traditions . have a listen to the live recordings below to hear some festive selections sung by the shchedryk children 's choir at a deutsche welle concerto discreto concert in bonn . author : inge ivanovic -lrb- gsw -rrb- editor : rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 20.12.2010 germany calls for an eu database of organic producers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a big market for organic produce following scandals over falsely labeled organic meat , germany wants the eu to set up a database of certified organic produce suppliers .
those in favor say such a system will provide greater transparency for consumers . in an effort to curb fraudulent abuse of organic labels , the german government is calling on the european commission to set up a europe-wide database of certified organic producers .
the database would be used to crack down on agents who have been using organic labels to sell conventional meat more expensively .
organic regulators would be obliged to immediately register any producer that failed a check .
" in case they withdraw a certificate , inspectors of organic food producers would immediately have to update the data base " , wolfgang reimer , in charge of organic agriculture at germany 's federal agricultural ministry , told the taz newspaper .
data sharing is vital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : licenses for organic producers can be forged or abused currently , databases are not " compulsory " and not all inspectors share their data .
private inspectors are commissioned by state authorities to check whether organic food producers stick to the european union 's regulations governing organic produce .
among other things , the rules require farmers to abstain from using many conventional pesticides as well as mineral fertilizers .
only if farmers adhere to these rules can they obtain organic certification .
yet these paper certificates are relatively easy to forge , and there have been several cases of fraud in recent months surrounding labeling of organic produce .
in september , a german poultry farmer from the western town of delbrueck was tried for mixing conventional meat with expensive organic meat .
the new system proposed by germany 's agriculture ministry would allow supermarket chains to check whether their suppliers were still certified to deliver organic produce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producers acknowledge that customers need more transparency no license , no business in a recent cross-border case , italian pig farmer paolo zaccardi continued using copies of his old certificate even after the authorities had withdrawn the license .
using false documents he was able to sell cheap conventional meat to german customers as high-quality organic food , which earned him at least one million euros .
" we 've asked the european commission to intervene in italy " , wolfgang reimer told the taz , adding that pressure needed to be intensified on italian authorities to solve the issue .
" we 've had problems with italy for quite some time now " , reimer said .
in many cases , he said , inspectors had found pesticide residue in italian food sold in germany under an organic label .
the european farmers ' umbrella group copa-cogeca generally welcomes the initiative : " we are in favor of all initiatives that improve transparency " , eva coral from copa-cogeca told deutsche welle .
copa-cogeca is also working on suggestions for making labelling easier for consumers in the european union , by synchronizing labels across the bloc .
" one thing is important when we think about new initiatives " , said coral , " we do n't want more paperwork for the producers .

but silent night – a song known the world over – has very humble origins . silent night 's roots can be traced back to the tiny village of oberndorf in the state of salzburg , austria .
it was written by priest , father joseph mohr , and in its original german form was called , " stille nacht , heilige nacht " , literally , " silent night , holy night . "
mohr 's lyrics were then set to music by schoolteacher franz xaver gruber and the song was first performed in the church of st. nicholas in oberndorf , austria during the christmas service of december 24th 1818 .
unlike the dreamy lullaby we know today , in its original incarnation it was an up-tempo dance tune .
all is calm , all is bright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silent night 's composers : father joseph mohr and franz xaver gruber as mohr 's written reminiscences make no mention of a source of inspiration for the song , its imagined origins have spawned a number of urban myths over the years .
one story has it that the organ in the church of st. nicholas was broken and so a new song had to be hastily written for a different instrument .
another , and perhaps more likely explanation , suggests that mohr simply wanted a new christmas song he could play on his guitar .
the song was translated into english in 1859 by john freeman young , second bishop for the episcopal diocese of florida , and quickly became a popular christmas standard both in religious services and with door-to-door carol singers .
during the 1914 world war i christmas truce , silent night was sung simultaneously by servicemen in english , french and german ; the only song soldiers on both sides of the front line had in common .
sleep in heavenly peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with tourists : the silent night memorial chapel in oberndorf over the decades the song has steadily gained popularity , and has been recorded time and again by pop artists such as the temptations , mahalia jackson and elvis presley .
they each added their own personal touches to the carol , and mahalia jackson ’ s lazy , blues-influenced version even holds the rather unusual honor of being one of the best-selling singles of all time … in norway .
since its first performance on that chilly christmas eve in 1818 , silent night has since been translated into 44 languages and remains , to this day , one of the world ’ s best known and beloved carols .

but silent night – a song known the world over – has very humble origins . silent night 's roots can be traced back to the tiny village of oberndorf in the state of salzburg , austria .
it was written by priest , father joseph mohr , and in its original german form was called , " stille nacht , heilige nacht " , literally , " silent night , holy night . "
mohr 's lyrics were then set to music by schoolteacher franz xaver gruber and the song was first performed in the church of st. nicholas in oberndorf , austria during the christmas service of december 24th 1818 .
unlike the dreamy lullaby we know today , in its original incarnation it was an up-tempo dance tune .
all is calm , all is bright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silent night 's composers : father joseph mohr and franz xaver gruber as mohr 's written reminiscences make no mention of a source of inspiration for the song , its imagined origins have spawned a number of urban myths over the years .
one story has it that the organ in the church of st. nicholas was broken and so a new song had to be hastily written for a different instrument .
another , and perhaps more likely explanation , suggests that mohr simply wanted a new christmas song he could play on his guitar .
the song was translated into english in 1859 by john freeman young , second bishop for the episcopal diocese of florida , and quickly became a popular christmas standard both in religious services and with door-to-door carol singers .
during the 1914 world war i christmas truce , silent night was sung simultaneously by servicemen in english , french and german ; the only song soldiers on both sides of the front line had in common .
sleep in heavenly peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with tourists : the silent night memorial chapel in oberndorf over the decades the song has steadily gained popularity , and has been recorded time and again by pop artists such as the temptations , mahalia jackson and elvis presley .
they each added their own personal touches to the carol , and mahalia jackson ’ s lazy , blues-influenced version even holds the rather unusual honor of being one of the best-selling singles of all time … in norway .
since its first performance on that chilly christmas eve in 1818 , silent night has since been translated into 44 languages and remains , to this day , one of the world ’ s best known and beloved carols .

welcoming and hopeful faces manning the christmas stands still hope for customers despite this year 's terror warning , icy rain , and swirling snowstorms .
johanna sievers is one of them .
the young student is working for the first time at a traditional christmas market . her booth sells treats imported from the provence region in southern france , including rich almond studded nougat , caramels and chocolates . the newly opened gourmet shop she 's working for hopes to attract more customers through its booth . terror warning but after a government-issued terror warning was released at the end of november , along with news reports that christmas markets might be targeted , some of sievers ' friends expressed concerns about her job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sievers is n't letting security concerns get her down “ when i say i 'm working in a christmas market , many say ' oh my god , really ? ' and they are worried .
i 'm worried too , a little bit , ” she admits .
“ well , the world 's a dangerous place , so why not go to a christmas market ?
you can cross the street and get run over .
that 's actually more likely . ”
many christmas markets are trying to calm fears with a visible police presence and non-uniformed security personnel making their rounds to keep everyone happy - and shopping . as a norwegian tourist picks up a tiny bag of chocolate-covered figs , sievers makes sure to point out the price , 5 euros , explaining that people usually balk at paying that amount for the small bag of handcrafted french sweets .
unfazed , the tourist adds it to her order and also tells sievers to keep the change , not common behavior for berliners .
across town in prenzlauer berg 's scandinavian-themed lucia weihnachtsmarkt , bilgec serdaroglu is charming customers with his friendly demeanor and tasty hand-made goods .
a small but steady stream of customers stops at his stand to taste mustards flavored with whiskey , chilli and even licorice .
he also has vinegars and preserves .
most of his wares are priced at an affordable 2.50 euros . bildunterschrift : private security guards maintain a visible presence at berlin 's markets first rain , then snow serdaroglu , who moved to berlin from hamburg , has been selling at the market for six years , but this is the first year he is at the market with his own company .
he 's excited . still , serdaroglu admits people in the city have a tight grip on their wallets .
" berlin is the capital , but the sad part is that it 's the weakest city economically , " he says .
people have difficulties with money , he adds , and going to the christmas market definitely means spending money . " if i take my children to the christmas market , i have to plan on spending an average of 50 euros , " serdaroglu says .
" can i afford it or not ?
that 's the question .
so i can understand when people are holding back a bit . "
open air markets like this one also suffer from the weather .
first came the rain at the end of november , followed by surprising amounts of snow , which cancelled flights and delayed trains , slowing down locals and tourists alike .
and while visitors to berlin 's christmas markets seem to be taking the terror warnings and weather surprises in stride , they are n't all whipping out their cash .
stands selling hot drinks , snacks and affordable gifts are doing well , but some merchants offering jewelry , pottery and other higher priced items gaze out from their unvisited booths looking bored and frustrated . browsing but not buying from a spot next to a wood-burning stove , visitor frank huehn watches the crowd slowly pass by a stand selling felted boots from switzerland .
many people stop to look and warm their hands , but few purchase the shoes , which cost over 100 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of browsing but not enough buying at stands , merchants say .
huehn , a merchant himself , is n't selling his own sheepskin goods at this christmas market or any other .
“ the question is n't just how many people come and walk around the market ; vendors are interested in how many are shopping , " he says .
" the market can be very busy , with people exhibiting their wares , and visitors browsing , but they are n't necessarily buying anything . "
the rent at holiday markets , huehn argues , is too high for an unpredictable payoff .
committing for the full run of the season is too risky ; he prefers to try his luck at weekly local markets instead . in the last few years , things have changed for small sellers of handmade goods , partly because of the financial crisis and partly because of a new mindset in germany , according to huehn .
“ in my opinion , a majority of today 's 25 and 30-year-olds just do n't have a sense for quality in products and materials , " he says .
" they do n't work with their hands anymore , so they have no idea - they ca n't judge the quality . they just decide on the price . the older people can tell - they can pick something up in their hands and feel the quality , and they 're ready to pay for it .
the young people ca n't . it 's an unfortunate development . ”

but ngo human rights watch is reporting a new wave of forced recruitment . twenty-one-year-old big is banging on his drums on the outskirts of bukavu , the capital of south kivu province in the eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
big was not always such a talented percussionist .
just five years ago he was handling guns , not drumsticks . big was 12 when he joined an armed group in bukavu . he had just witnessed his brother being killed , and the prospect of revenge and money made joining up seem like a good option .
" i saw other children earning money with the army , so i decided to join , " big said .
" physically , they did n't treat me badly because they wanted me to be a healthy member of the group .
but mentally they were not good to me , they gave me bad ideas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thousand young people have been recruited since september , says human rights watch it 's a choice big now wants to put behind him , and one that many children involved in armed groups - whether as soldiers , servants or sex slaves - never made in the first place .
during the second congo war between 1998 and 2003 , thousands of children voluntarily joined armed groups , or were conscripted or born into them .
although the drc is no longer officially at war , the country remains highly militarized as competition over resources , ethnic disputes and political ideologies sustain conflict . now , a report from non-government organization human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- suggests the number of children being forcibly recruited is again on the rise .
' a thousand boys in four months ' human rights watch researchers found that at least a thousand young men and boys have been forcibly recruited and trained for combat since september .
at least 261 of them were under the age of 18 , says karina tercsakean , a senior researcher with human rights watch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drc government has tried to clamp down on child recruitment , but little has changed " the real number is probably even higher , " she told deutsche welle .
" we 've seen an increase in tensions in eastern drc late this year .
some rebel groups have nominally been integrated into the army , but they maintain their separate structures , so they look to expand their ranks . "
she added that rebel groups fighting the army also appear to be recruiting new child soldiers .
young men are abducted from their homes , or they disappear after officers have paid schools or football pitches a visit , says tercsakean .
some boys are promised money or other benefits .
" what is especially worrying is that some of the young men were demobilized in the past , and now they 're re-recruited , " tercsakean said .
human rights watch is calling on the drc government to step up efforts to stamp out such recruitment .
although the practice contravenes local and international law , perpetrators often go unpunished .
breaking the cycle one group that has been involved in demobilizing children is the association de soutien de l 'opprime -lrb- association for the support of oppressed persons , or aso -rrb- , the drumming and theater group now helping rehabilitate big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after they 've been demobilized , many young boys get re-recruited originally , the group was made up of former child soldiers but has expanded over the years to include other marginalized young people : children who have been raped , accused of witchcraft , or simply abandoned .
" when i started psychosocial activities , we found that the cultural activities such as music and theatre could help the youth start over , " said aso coordinator juvenal muderhwa .
" they forget what they lived and rediscover their culture that was missing . "
often children who have fought with armed groups , been raped or accused of witchcraft are shunned by their family and community .
they are left to fend for themselves and overcome their traumatic past alone , which can make recovery all but impossible .
drumming up support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumming can help overcome trauma " an important factor of overcoming a traumatic event is falling back on one 's social network , " said anna maedl , a clinical psychologist from the university of konstanz , in germany .
" when people feel supported by their community , when they feel that they are loved and that others understand what happened to them and that it was not their fault that will help them a lot . "
many of the children working with aso , including big , now participate in performances designed to tackle stigma and to discourage other children from considering joining armed groups .
" my goal is to change the ideas of young people like me , " big said .
" i also would like -lsb- the communities we visit -rsb- to see that they too can change and develop , just like i did , through art . "

but silent night – a song known the world over – has very humble origins . silent night 's roots can be traced back to the tiny village of oberndorf in the state of salzburg , austria .
it was written by priest , father joseph mohr , and in its original german form was called , " stille nacht , heilige nacht " , literally , " silent night , holy night . "
mohr 's lyrics were then set to music by schoolteacher franz xaver gruber and the song was first performed in the church of st. nicholas in oberndorf , austria during the christmas service of december 24th 1818 .
unlike the dreamy lullaby we know today , in its original incarnation it was an up-tempo dance tune .
all is calm , all is bright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silent night 's composers : father joseph mohr and franz xaver gruber as mohr 's written reminiscences make no mention of a source of inspiration for the song , its imagined origins have spawned a number of urban myths over the years .
one story has it that the organ in the church of st. nicholas was broken and so a new song had to be hastily written for a different instrument .
another , and perhaps more likely explanation , suggests that mohr simply wanted a new christmas song he could play on his guitar .
the song was translated into english in 1859 by john freeman young , second bishop for the episcopal diocese of florida , and quickly became a popular christmas standard both in religious services and with door-to-door carol singers .
during the 1914 world war i christmas truce , silent night was sung simultaneously by servicemen in english , french and german ; the only song soldiers on both sides of the front line had in common .
sleep in heavenly peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with tourists : the silent night memorial chapel in oberndorf over the decades the song has steadily gained popularity , and has been recorded time and again by pop artists such as the temptations , mahalia jackson and elvis presley .
they each added their own personal touches to the carol , and mahalia jackson ’ s lazy , blues-influenced version even holds the rather unusual honor of being one of the best-selling singles of all time … in norway .
since its first performance on that chilly christmas eve in 1818 , silent night has since been translated into 44 languages and remains , to this day , one of the world ’ s best known and beloved carols .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 20.12.2010 berlin 's christmas markets try to trade cheer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has no shortage of christmas markets facing a terror warning , a slowly recovering economy , and drastic weather , berlin 's more than 50 christmas markets are dealing with more challenges than usual this year . booth lights twinkle , children 's rides whirl and spin , and carols rings out from overhead loudspeakers at the city weihnachtsmarkt in the western part of berlin .
welcoming and hopeful faces manning the christmas stands still hope for customers despite this year 's terror warning , icy rain , and swirling snowstorms .
johanna sievers is one of them .
the young student is working for the first time at a traditional christmas market . her booth sells treats imported from the provence region in southern france , including rich almond studded nougat , caramels and chocolates . the newly opened gourmet shop she 's working for hopes to attract more customers through its booth . terror warning but after a government-issued terror warning was released at the end of november , along with news reports that christmas markets might be targeted , some of sievers ' friends expressed concerns about her job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sievers is n't letting security concerns get her down “ when i say i 'm working in a christmas market , many say ' oh my god , really ? ' and they are worried .
i 'm worried too , a little bit , ” she admits .
“ well , the world 's a dangerous place , so why not go to a christmas market ?
you can cross the street and get run over .
that 's actually more likely . ”
many christmas markets are trying to calm fears with a visible police presence and non-uniformed security personnel making their rounds to keep everyone happy - and shopping . as a norwegian tourist picks up a tiny bag of chocolate-covered figs , sievers makes sure to point out the price , 5 euros , explaining that people usually balk at paying that amount for the small bag of handcrafted french sweets .
unfazed , the tourist adds it to her order and also tells sievers to keep the change , not common behavior for berliners .
across town in prenzlauer berg 's scandinavian-themed lucia weihnachtsmarkt , bilgec serdaroglu is charming customers with his friendly demeanor and tasty hand-made goods .
a small but steady stream of customers stops at his stand to taste mustards flavored with whiskey , chilli and even licorice .
he also has vinegars and preserves .
most of his wares are priced at an affordable 2.50 euros . bildunterschrift : private security guards maintain a visible presence at berlin 's markets first rain , then snow serdaroglu , who moved to berlin from hamburg , has been selling at the market for six years , but this is the first year he is at the market with his own company .
he 's excited . still , serdaroglu admits people in the city have a tight grip on their wallets .
" berlin is the capital , but the sad part is that it 's the weakest city economically , " he says .
people have difficulties with money , he adds , and going to the christmas market definitely means spending money . " if i take my children to the christmas market , i have to plan on spending an average of 50 euros , " serdaroglu says .
" can i afford it or not ?
that 's the question .
so i can understand when people are holding back a bit . "
open air markets like this one also suffer from the weather .
first came the rain at the end of november , followed by surprising amounts of snow , which cancelled flights and delayed trains , slowing down locals and tourists alike .
and while visitors to berlin 's christmas markets seem to be taking the terror warnings and weather surprises in stride , they are n't all whipping out their cash .
stands selling hot drinks , snacks and affordable gifts are doing well , but some merchants offering jewelry , pottery and other higher priced items gaze out from their unvisited booths looking bored and frustrated . browsing but not buying from a spot next to a wood-burning stove , visitor frank huehn watches the crowd slowly pass by a stand selling felted boots from switzerland .
many people stop to look and warm their hands , but few purchase the shoes , which cost over 100 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of browsing but not enough buying at stands , merchants say .
huehn , a merchant himself , is n't selling his own sheepskin goods at this christmas market or any other .
“ the question is n't just how many people come and walk around the market ; vendors are interested in how many are shopping , " he says .
" the market can be very busy , with people exhibiting their wares , and visitors browsing , but they are n't necessarily buying anything . "
the rent at holiday markets , huehn argues , is too high for an unpredictable payoff .
committing for the full run of the season is too risky ; he prefers to try his luck at weekly local markets instead . in the last few years , things have changed for small sellers of handmade goods , partly because of the financial crisis and partly because of a new mindset in germany , according to huehn .
“ in my opinion , a majority of today 's 25 and 30-year-olds just do n't have a sense for quality in products and materials , " he says .
" they do n't work with their hands anymore , so they have no idea - they ca n't judge the quality . they just decide on the price . the older people can tell - they can pick something up in their hands and feel the quality , and they 're ready to pay for it .
the young people ca n't . it 's an unfortunate development . ”

welcoming and hopeful faces manning the christmas stands still hope for customers despite this year 's terror warning , icy rain , and swirling snowstorms .
johanna sievers is one of them .
the young student is working for the first time at a traditional christmas market . her booth sells treats imported from the provence region in southern france , including rich almond studded nougat , caramels and chocolates . the newly opened gourmet shop she 's working for hopes to attract more customers through its booth . terror warning but after a government-issued terror warning was released at the end of november , along with news reports that christmas markets might be targeted , some of sievers ' friends expressed concerns about her job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sievers is n't letting security concerns get her down “ when i say i 'm working in a christmas market , many say ' oh my god , really ? ' and they are worried .
i 'm worried too , a little bit , ” she admits .
“ well , the world 's a dangerous place , so why not go to a christmas market ?
you can cross the street and get run over .
that 's actually more likely . ”
many christmas markets are trying to calm fears with a visible police presence and non-uniformed security personnel making their rounds to keep everyone happy - and shopping . as a norwegian tourist picks up a tiny bag of chocolate-covered figs , sievers makes sure to point out the price , 5 euros , explaining that people usually balk at paying that amount for the small bag of handcrafted french sweets .
unfazed , the tourist adds it to her order and also tells sievers to keep the change , not common behavior for berliners .
across town in prenzlauer berg 's scandinavian-themed lucia weihnachtsmarkt , bilgec serdaroglu is charming customers with his friendly demeanor and tasty hand-made goods .
a small but steady stream of customers stops at his stand to taste mustards flavored with whiskey , chilli and even licorice .
he also has vinegars and preserves .
most of his wares are priced at an affordable 2.50 euros . bildunterschrift : private security guards maintain a visible presence at berlin 's markets first rain , then snow serdaroglu , who moved to berlin from hamburg , has been selling at the market for six years , but this is the first year he is at the market with his own company .
he 's excited . still , serdaroglu admits people in the city have a tight grip on their wallets .
" berlin is the capital , but the sad part is that it 's the weakest city economically , " he says .
people have difficulties with money , he adds , and going to the christmas market definitely means spending money . " if i take my children to the christmas market , i have to plan on spending an average of 50 euros , " serdaroglu says .
" can i afford it or not ?
that 's the question .
so i can understand when people are holding back a bit . "
open air markets like this one also suffer from the weather .
first came the rain at the end of november , followed by surprising amounts of snow , which cancelled flights and delayed trains , slowing down locals and tourists alike .
and while visitors to berlin 's christmas markets seem to be taking the terror warnings and weather surprises in stride , they are n't all whipping out their cash .
stands selling hot drinks , snacks and affordable gifts are doing well , but some merchants offering jewelry , pottery and other higher priced items gaze out from their unvisited booths looking bored and frustrated . browsing but not buying from a spot next to a wood-burning stove , visitor frank huehn watches the crowd slowly pass by a stand selling felted boots from switzerland .
many people stop to look and warm their hands , but few purchase the shoes , which cost over 100 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of browsing but not enough buying at stands , merchants say .
huehn , a merchant himself , is n't selling his own sheepskin goods at this christmas market or any other .
“ the question is n't just how many people come and walk around the market ; vendors are interested in how many are shopping , " he says .
" the market can be very busy , with people exhibiting their wares , and visitors browsing , but they are n't necessarily buying anything . "
the rent at holiday markets , huehn argues , is too high for an unpredictable payoff .
committing for the full run of the season is too risky ; he prefers to try his luck at weekly local markets instead . in the last few years , things have changed for small sellers of handmade goods , partly because of the financial crisis and partly because of a new mindset in germany , according to huehn .
“ in my opinion , a majority of today 's 25 and 30-year-olds just do n't have a sense for quality in products and materials , " he says .
" they do n't work with their hands anymore , so they have no idea - they ca n't judge the quality . they just decide on the price . the older people can tell - they can pick something up in their hands and feel the quality , and they 're ready to pay for it .
the young people ca n't . it 's an unfortunate development . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 20.12.2010 child soldier recruitment on the rise , says report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children as young as six are often trained for combat in the eastern democratic republic of congo , a group of former child soldiers are starting to rebuild their lives through drumming and theatre .
but ngo human rights watch is reporting a new wave of forced recruitment . twenty-one-year-old big is banging on his drums on the outskirts of bukavu , the capital of south kivu province in the eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
big was not always such a talented percussionist .
just five years ago he was handling guns , not drumsticks . big was 12 when he joined an armed group in bukavu . he had just witnessed his brother being killed , and the prospect of revenge and money made joining up seem like a good option .
" i saw other children earning money with the army , so i decided to join , " big said .
" physically , they did n't treat me badly because they wanted me to be a healthy member of the group .
but mentally they were not good to me , they gave me bad ideas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thousand young people have been recruited since september , says human rights watch it 's a choice big now wants to put behind him , and one that many children involved in armed groups - whether as soldiers , servants or sex slaves - never made in the first place .
during the second congo war between 1998 and 2003 , thousands of children voluntarily joined armed groups , or were conscripted or born into them .
although the drc is no longer officially at war , the country remains highly militarized as competition over resources , ethnic disputes and political ideologies sustain conflict . now , a report from non-government organization human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- suggests the number of children being forcibly recruited is again on the rise .
' a thousand boys in four months ' human rights watch researchers found that at least a thousand young men and boys have been forcibly recruited and trained for combat since september .
at least 261 of them were under the age of 18 , says karina tercsakean , a senior researcher with human rights watch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drc government has tried to clamp down on child recruitment , but little has changed " the real number is probably even higher , " she told deutsche welle .
" we 've seen an increase in tensions in eastern drc late this year .
some rebel groups have nominally been integrated into the army , but they maintain their separate structures , so they look to expand their ranks . "
she added that rebel groups fighting the army also appear to be recruiting new child soldiers .
young men are abducted from their homes , or they disappear after officers have paid schools or football pitches a visit , says tercsakean .
some boys are promised money or other benefits .
" what is especially worrying is that some of the young men were demobilized in the past , and now they 're re-recruited , " tercsakean said .
human rights watch is calling on the drc government to step up efforts to stamp out such recruitment .
although the practice contravenes local and international law , perpetrators often go unpunished .
breaking the cycle one group that has been involved in demobilizing children is the association de soutien de l 'opprime -lrb- association for the support of oppressed persons , or aso -rrb- , the drumming and theater group now helping rehabilitate big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after they 've been demobilized , many young boys get re-recruited originally , the group was made up of former child soldiers but has expanded over the years to include other marginalized young people : children who have been raped , accused of witchcraft , or simply abandoned .
" when i started psychosocial activities , we found that the cultural activities such as music and theatre could help the youth start over , " said aso coordinator juvenal muderhwa .
" they forget what they lived and rediscover their culture that was missing . "
often children who have fought with armed groups , been raped or accused of witchcraft are shunned by their family and community .
they are left to fend for themselves and overcome their traumatic past alone , which can make recovery all but impossible .
drumming up support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumming can help overcome trauma " an important factor of overcoming a traumatic event is falling back on one 's social network , " said anna maedl , a clinical psychologist from the university of konstanz , in germany .
" when people feel supported by their community , when they feel that they are loved and that others understand what happened to them and that it was not their fault that will help them a lot . "
many of the children working with aso , including big , now participate in performances designed to tackle stigma and to discourage other children from considering joining armed groups .
" my goal is to change the ideas of young people like me , " big said .
" i also would like -lsb- the communities we visit -rsb- to see that they too can change and develop , just like i did , through art . "

they 're not very good .
others combine poor performances with delusions of grandeur and animosity toward the world .
deutsche welle identifies the worst offenders . in goal many players pitch a hissy fit if they get benched , but ex-cologne keeper faryd mondragon took his tantrum to a previously unknown biblical level .
having been relieved of his starting role for poor performances and absence due to international duties , the colombian refused to play at all , and then held a press conference comparing his martyrdom to that of jesus .
cologne are apparently non-believers , shipping the malcontent messiah to philadelphia union in the mls .
cologne fans will be happy that faryd is mondra-gone .
the back line among the poor defenders , one particularly stands out .
germany 's leading football magazine , kicker , has ranked bremen 's mikael silvestre the worst player in the entire league , and he was a consensus choice for that distinction among the deutsche welle sport brain-trust as well .
the frenchman tries hard , but is clearly past his prime and was one major reason for bremen 's sputtering start .
bildunterschrift : silvestre ca n't keep up with the league 's youngsters paired with him in our porous central defense is gladbach 's anderson .
the 22-year-old brazilian was a major signing for the foals this summer , but he has " led " his new club to a truly laughable record of 47 goals conceded .
as dw sports writer nick amies succinctly put it ... " atrocious . "
on the flailing flanks , we have hamburg 's guy demel .
once a mainstay in northern germany , the ivorian has become , in the words of dw sports editor matt hermann , " a walking lapse in concentration . "
and not only has hamburg coach armin veh removed him from the starting line-up .
he did n't even make the bench in his club 's last match of the year .
joining him is bremen 's petri pasanen .
hamburg 's arch-rivals have always conceded lots of goals for a top side , but this year , the problem is worse than ever .
bremen 's goal difference is a lousy -12 .
opponents encounter little resistance on the wings , and the finnish veteran has simply not been up to the job .
the problem for bremen is that no one else has been , either .
the midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weather in germany has n't suited camoranesi , r among the candidates put forward for the middle of the pitch were bremen 's marko arnautovic and bayern 's franck ribery , but injuries have somewhat mitigated their poor production .
still , our mediocre midfield features some big names .
stuttgart 's mauro camaronesi has had a lot of highlights in his career , including winning the italian league title and the world cup .
but he 'll want to forget his time at stuttgart thus far .
brought in to great hoopla in the summer , he ca n't even make the starting line-up of a team that 's wintering in the drop zone .
matt put forward wolfsburg 's josue , a former team captain relegated to the bench , but dw sports writer jefferson chase overruled him in favor of the wolves ' diego .
when you pay some 18 million euros for a star with a history of excellence in the bundesliga , you expect more than a handful of goals with the odd assist thrown in .
the brazilian is also hot-headed and is very lucky not to have gotten sent off this season .
value for money is something else .
another playmaker who 's not making the grade is gladbach 's juan arango .
two goals , three assists and one very foolish red card that cost the foals a chance to get much needed points against hoffenheim are the venezuelan 's sad balance sheet .
as nick succinctly put it ... " atrocious . "
and lest anyone think we 're picking on foreigners , completing our flailing foursome is bremen 's aaron hunt .
the german youngster was charged with replacing mesut oezil this season , and he simply has n't been able to .
this may not be entirely his fault , as he was originally a wing striker and some problems adjusting to a new role could have been expected .
but one thing is already clear : a playmaker , he is not .
the forwards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobadilla may love gladbach , but he has n't done them any favors as everyone knows , strikers run hot and cold , so one player scoring more or less than another is often just a reflection of luck and form , and not a fundamental difference in quality .
in order to make the dw sports worst eleven , a forward had to do more than just not score .
he had to kick up a stink in the process .
for that reason , schalke 's edu gets a free pass , despite being nominated by matt .
ciprian marica , who earned a three-match ban late on , when stuttgart really needed him , attracted jefferson 's ire and almost earned a spot in the hall of shame .
but he still came up short .
that 's because matt made a persuasive argument for hamburg 's paolo guerrero , calling him " among the most delusionally self-important players in the league . "
rarely have fans been treated to so much pouting and gesticulating from a player who has a grand total of two goals to his credit after 17 games .
hamburg had great hopes for the peruvian when they brought him from bayern in 2006 - three-and-a-half years on there 's little doubt that he 's not going to fulfill them .
but even guerrero could n't top the histrionics of gladbach 's raul bobadilla .
apparently after taking anger-management lessons from diego maradona , the argentinian went on a rampage in the foals ' match against hanover in early december .
although his team were leading , bobadilla was so incensed in the first half that he lashed out physically at an opponent and verbally at an official , earning himself a straight red .
gladbach went on to lose the match , and bobilla has been suspended indefinitely .
not what your team needs in the struggle against the drop .

but many observers on the ground say that not much has changed for the better . the dutch researcher and afghanistan expert alex strick van linschoten is one of the few westerners who live in kandahar . he is the co-editor of ' my life with the taliban , ' a book about mullah abdul salam zaeef , the taliban ’ s ambassador to pakistan in 2001 .
he 's currently working on a study on the links between the taliban and al-qaeda , which will be published in conjunction with the center on international cooperation , new york university . deutsche welle : the us troop surge has been visible in the south of afghanistan since the spring of 2010 .
what effect has it had so far on kandahar ? alex strick van linschoten : in some ways , nothing has changed .
there have been foreign troops in and outside kandahar city for several years .
but there are some cosmetic shifts .
you have a lot of traffic jams in the city now .
before , there used to be mainly canadian troops in kandahar , and they would drive around the city so that they would n't cause traffic jams .
this helped to protect them -lrb- as well as locals in the area -rrb- from being hit by ieds -lrb- improvised explosive devices -rrb- .
but now the americans drive straight through the city .
so when an ied goes off , people blame the americans for driving through .
they do n't blame the taliban for placing the bomb .
you also have much more air traffic compared to the last year .
what is the population 's reaction to the conflict ? there are all sorts of things that resonate badly with the people .
i spoke to a cameraman who was embedded with the us troops in arghandab district for a documentary .
he mentioned the case of a us commander who went to a village telling the elders , " you have to show us where all the ieds and mines are , in and around your village .
if not , i 'm going to bombard your village . "
the elders said , " we do n't know where they are . " the local population feels reminded of the soviet times , when there was a concept of collective responsibility as well - something actually forbidden by the 1949 geneva convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war .
how would you describe the situation in kandahar ? people are depressed .
the younger ones are trying to leave .
just a few days ago , two deputy directors of departments were assassinated .
anyone who works for the government is being threatened .
the taliban now have a commission in the city calling on people to leave their jobs .
they know exactly who is doing what .
there is no way that the afghan government or the americans can protect all the people .
the military certainly ca n't pay enough for civilians to risk their lives for a government that no one really believes is going to survive in the present form .
how do the taliban operate in town ? they have a mediation commission .
when you get a ' night letter ' , for example from the taliban , warning the locals not to work with what the taliban call the occupiers , you can object to this letter , arguing that you have n't done anything wrong .
it is their own ' hearts and minds ' campaign .
on the other hand , i do n't see too much of the ideological side in kandahar .
yes , islam is a motivating factor for the insurgency , but i never really found that islam was the main motivating factor for the taliban in the south .
there are many other factors that people think of and talk about before islam .
the us military and government say that they have gained ' momentum ' and that they see progress ... my sense is that general petraeus thinks that he can win the war militarily .
i think he may be overestimating his ability to achieve this goal , and underestimating at the same time the effect it has on the taliban .
i do n't think petraeus has a serious interest in a settlement that sees the taliban as a part of afghan society .
was the strategy of petraeus ' predecessor more promising ? compared to petraeus , mcchrystal seemed like he understood things far better and had a better appreciation of the effects of us military actions .
you can see it in the number of night raids .
when you look at the isaf statistics , about the day after petraeus arrived there was a massive spike in night raids .
petraeus has also restarted the air war .
in november , compared to the last year , three times as many bombs were dropped on afghanistan . to what extent is the western and afghan military strategy hurting the taliban ?
how do they react ? the night raids certainly have an effect .
they catch or kill a lot of them .
but it does n't seem to have either irrevocably damaged their morale or their ability to carry out attacks .
there does n't seem to be a change in the number of assassinations in the city .
it is tough for the taliban , but they will come back in spring and start all over again . some argue that the taliban are about to change and possibly get more radical as a result of the war .
do you agree ? you can see it in terms of their tactics in the number of beheadings .
that would not have happened before .
it is the same in terms of their attitude to authority , killing elders for example , and also talking back to quetta , the senior leadership , in not being completely subservient to them .
you see it in the general fragmentation also : the taliban shadow governor in kandahar city does n't have control over all taliban groups any more .
a lot of civilian killings in the city are n't ordered from quetta . they often comes from small groups .
some may be pushed by pakistan .
but you have a lot more voices now than before .
what does that mean for the months ahead ? the worry , of course , is that all of these things may eventually lead to a sort of taliban that will look more to an international ' jihad ' with younger people in charge on the side of the insurgency , who have only lived in conflict and war , and who do n't even remember the old afghanistan , or the meaning of peace , from before the soviet war .

those in favor say such a system will provide greater transparency for consumers . in an effort to curb fraudulent abuse of organic labels , the german government is calling on the european commission to set up a europe-wide database of certified organic producers .
the database would be used to crack down on agents who have been using organic labels to sell conventional meat more expensively .
organic regulators would be obliged to immediately register any producer that failed a check .
" in case they withdraw a certificate , inspectors of organic food producers would immediately have to update the data base " , wolfgang reimer , in charge of organic agriculture at germany 's federal agricultural ministry , told the taz newspaper .
data sharing is vital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : licenses for organic producers can be forged or abused currently , databases are not " compulsory " and not all inspectors share their data .
private inspectors are commissioned by state authorities to check whether organic food producers stick to the european union 's regulations governing organic produce .
among other things , the rules require farmers to abstain from using many conventional pesticides as well as mineral fertilizers .
only if farmers adhere to these rules can they obtain organic certification .
yet these paper certificates are relatively easy to forge , and there have been several cases of fraud in recent months surrounding labeling of organic produce .
in september , a german poultry farmer from the western town of delbrueck was tried for mixing conventional meat with expensive organic meat .
the new system proposed by germany 's agriculture ministry would allow supermarket chains to check whether their suppliers were still certified to deliver organic produce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producers acknowledge that customers need more transparency no license , no business in a recent cross-border case , italian pig farmer paolo zaccardi continued using copies of his old certificate even after the authorities had withdrawn the license .
using false documents he was able to sell cheap conventional meat to german customers as high-quality organic food , which earned him at least one million euros .
" we 've asked the european commission to intervene in italy " , wolfgang reimer told the taz , adding that pressure needed to be intensified on italian authorities to solve the issue .
" we 've had problems with italy for quite some time now " , reimer said .
in many cases , he said , inspectors had found pesticide residue in italian food sold in germany under an organic label .
the european farmers ' umbrella group copa-cogeca generally welcomes the initiative : " we are in favor of all initiatives that improve transparency " , eva coral from copa-cogeca told deutsche welle .
copa-cogeca is also working on suggestions for making labelling easier for consumers in the european union , by synchronizing labels across the bloc .
" one thing is important when we think about new initiatives " , said coral , " we do n't want more paperwork for the producers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 20.12.2010 techno-skeptic parliamentarians trained to use twitter , facebook großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damien abad , an mep from france , loves twitter a young french member of the european parliament is leading the charge .
advocates hope that the increased use of social networking will get younger europeans interested in what happens in brussels . public apathy is always a big problem for communicators in european union institutions . fewer than half of eligible voters turned out for ep elections in 2009 , continuing a decline that started 30 years ago . but there 's a new breed of european politicians who are tackling the problem of a public disconnect one keystroke at a time .
one of them is damien abad , a 30-year-old member of the european parliament , or mep .
the man from southeastern france says it 's time eu politicians stop just lamenting the lack of interest from constituents and do something about it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european members of parliament are slowly learning how to use facebook so , his idea is to teach his fellow meps what has come all too naturally for people of his generation - using social networking sites like facebook , flickr and twitter as a way to share a personal and informal view of the otherwise obscure european institutions .
" in order for european people to love europe they have to know europe ! "
abad explains .
and in order for european parliamentarians to tweet , they have to know twitter . so abad , who already communicates regularly in 140-character messages , set up a series of educational seminars for his fellow parliamentarians and their staffs to show how and why to use the new social technologies . he thinks it will catch on , but acknowledges , " it 's necessary for us to find the most active meps in order to create a buzz . "
most meps have never heard of twitter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy buzek calls social networking an " opportunity we need to seize . "
but abad 's got an uphill climb .
only about third to a half of members have a twitter account . a survey a year ago showed that 62 percent of parliamentarians had never even heard of twitter or had never used it and did n't intend to .
jerzy buzek , the parliamentary president and polish represntative has set a good example , opening his own twitter account at the beginning of this year . at age 60 , buzek proves it 's not just a technology for the young gadget-crazy crowd . he warmly addressed the first social-media training session , encouraging participation .
" web 2.0 constitutes for us politicians an opportunity we need to seize , " he said in a pre-recorded video message , shown at one of the workshops held earlier this month in brussels .
" with facebook , twitter and other 2.0 tools , we can get reach out to our citizens on a daily , almost personal basis .
i see it every day through my facebook and twitter accounts . "
the keynote lecturer at that same workshop day was vincent ducrey , a well-known online consultant , who advises the french government on its social media policies and has written a book called the " guide of influence . "
ducrey has worked out meticulous models of the 24-hour news cycle and precisely how to use it for maximum messaging effect .
he said technophobe meps should just get over it , for everybody 's sake , not least their own .
" it 's not about a special party , it 's about democracy , " ducrey insists .
" if we want a high level of participation a high level of voters in three years , they need to start to interact , to raise the question of europe as soon as possible .
and twitter is a good way to do it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 62 percent of meps have never heard of twitter connecting person-to-person ducrey says politicians should learn to be tactical but also personable , and should never have an assistant writing their tweets .
one of the believers who 's urging her colleagues to hop on board is marietje schaake , a dutch mep who says she would n't be in brussels at all if it were n't for social media .
she says with a miniscule campaign budget in 2009 , virtually all the outreach in her campaign was , well , virtual .
" obviously you have an idea , " she said .
" people believe in the idea and in you as a person but to reach them and to interact with them and to make sure they know about you , it could only happen through the internet . "
there are others who 've been on the same wavelength , so to speak , for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : member of the european parliament are generally skeptical of social networking europatweets was a service formed during the 2009 parliamentary elections to distribute information regarding the vote .
it has continued and expanded with its partners into a new service called " tweet your mep " in september . the principle here , said belgian co-creator henri lastenouse , is to provoke conversation , for voters to feel their elected representatives are accountable to them and for the whole world to see if they are not , by looking at the public twitter accounts .
lastenouse predicts public officials will increasingly be forced to take this platform seriously .
they 'll also have to adjust to not being in complete control of what happens , lastenouse says , as they are when they just maintain a website and post items to it .
lastenouse says he 's looking forward to the day when the european commissioners are also pressed into keeping twitter accounts and citizens will be able to ask questions directly to , for example , commission president jose manuel barroso .
" with social media , it 's open and that 's a problem because they will have to answer the questions , " he warned .

advocates hope that the increased use of social networking will get younger europeans interested in what happens in brussels . public apathy is always a big problem for communicators in european union institutions . fewer than half of eligible voters turned out for ep elections in 2009 , continuing a decline that started 30 years ago . but there 's a new breed of european politicians who are tackling the problem of a public disconnect one keystroke at a time .
one of them is damien abad , a 30-year-old member of the european parliament , or mep .
the man from southeastern france says it 's time eu politicians stop just lamenting the lack of interest from constituents and do something about it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european members of parliament are slowly learning how to use facebook so , his idea is to teach his fellow meps what has come all too naturally for people of his generation - using social networking sites like facebook , flickr and twitter as a way to share a personal and informal view of the otherwise obscure european institutions .
" in order for european people to love europe they have to know europe ! "
abad explains .
and in order for european parliamentarians to tweet , they have to know twitter . so abad , who already communicates regularly in 140-character messages , set up a series of educational seminars for his fellow parliamentarians and their staffs to show how and why to use the new social technologies . he thinks it will catch on , but acknowledges , " it 's necessary for us to find the most active meps in order to create a buzz . "
most meps have never heard of twitter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy buzek calls social networking an " opportunity we need to seize . "
but abad 's got an uphill climb .
only about third to a half of members have a twitter account . a survey a year ago showed that 62 percent of parliamentarians had never even heard of twitter or had never used it and did n't intend to .
jerzy buzek , the parliamentary president and polish represntative has set a good example , opening his own twitter account at the beginning of this year . at age 60 , buzek proves it 's not just a technology for the young gadget-crazy crowd . he warmly addressed the first social-media training session , encouraging participation .
" web 2.0 constitutes for us politicians an opportunity we need to seize , " he said in a pre-recorded video message , shown at one of the workshops held earlier this month in brussels .
" with facebook , twitter and other 2.0 tools , we can get reach out to our citizens on a daily , almost personal basis .
i see it every day through my facebook and twitter accounts . "
the keynote lecturer at that same workshop day was vincent ducrey , a well-known online consultant , who advises the french government on its social media policies and has written a book called the " guide of influence . "
ducrey has worked out meticulous models of the 24-hour news cycle and precisely how to use it for maximum messaging effect .
he said technophobe meps should just get over it , for everybody 's sake , not least their own .
" it 's not about a special party , it 's about democracy , " ducrey insists .
" if we want a high level of participation a high level of voters in three years , they need to start to interact , to raise the question of europe as soon as possible .
and twitter is a good way to do it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 62 percent of meps have never heard of twitter connecting person-to-person ducrey says politicians should learn to be tactical but also personable , and should never have an assistant writing their tweets .
one of the believers who 's urging her colleagues to hop on board is marietje schaake , a dutch mep who says she would n't be in brussels at all if it were n't for social media .
she says with a miniscule campaign budget in 2009 , virtually all the outreach in her campaign was , well , virtual .
" obviously you have an idea , " she said .
" people believe in the idea and in you as a person but to reach them and to interact with them and to make sure they know about you , it could only happen through the internet . "
there are others who 've been on the same wavelength , so to speak , for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : member of the european parliament are generally skeptical of social networking europatweets was a service formed during the 2009 parliamentary elections to distribute information regarding the vote .
it has continued and expanded with its partners into a new service called " tweet your mep " in september . the principle here , said belgian co-creator henri lastenouse , is to provoke conversation , for voters to feel their elected representatives are accountable to them and for the whole world to see if they are not , by looking at the public twitter accounts .
lastenouse predicts public officials will increasingly be forced to take this platform seriously .
they 'll also have to adjust to not being in complete control of what happens , lastenouse says , as they are when they just maintain a website and post items to it .
lastenouse says he 's looking forward to the day when the european commissioners are also pressed into keeping twitter accounts and citizens will be able to ask questions directly to , for example , commission president jose manuel barroso .
" with social media , it 's open and that 's a problem because they will have to answer the questions , " he warned .

they 're not very good .
others combine poor performances with delusions of grandeur and animosity toward the world .
deutsche welle identifies the worst offenders . in goal many players pitch a hissy fit if they get benched , but ex-cologne keeper faryd mondragon took his tantrum to a previously unknown biblical level .
having been relieved of his starting role for poor performances and absence due to international duties , the colombian refused to play at all , and then held a press conference comparing his martyrdom to that of jesus .
cologne are apparently non-believers , shipping the malcontent messiah to philadelphia union in the mls .
cologne fans will be happy that faryd is mondra-gone .
the back line among the poor defenders , one particularly stands out .
germany 's leading football magazine , kicker , has ranked bremen 's mikael silvestre the worst player in the entire league , and he was a consensus choice for that distinction among the deutsche welle sport brain-trust as well .
the frenchman tries hard , but is clearly past his prime and was one major reason for bremen 's sputtering start .
bildunterschrift : silvestre ca n't keep up with the league 's youngsters paired with him in our porous central defense is gladbach 's anderson .
the 22-year-old brazilian was a major signing for the foals this summer , but he has " led " his new club to a truly laughable record of 47 goals conceded .
as dw sports writer nick amies succinctly put it ... " atrocious . "
on the flailing flanks , we have hamburg 's guy demel .
once a mainstay in northern germany , the ivorian has become , in the words of dw sports editor matt hermann , " a walking lapse in concentration . "
and not only has hamburg coach armin veh removed him from the starting line-up .
he did n't even make the bench in his club 's last match of the year .
joining him is bremen 's petri pasanen .
hamburg 's arch-rivals have always conceded lots of goals for a top side , but this year , the problem is worse than ever .
bremen 's goal difference is a lousy -12 .
opponents encounter little resistance on the wings , and the finnish veteran has simply not been up to the job .
the problem for bremen is that no one else has been , either .
the midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weather in germany has n't suited camoranesi , r among the candidates put forward for the middle of the pitch were bremen 's marko arnautovic and bayern 's franck ribery , but injuries have somewhat mitigated their poor production .
still , our mediocre midfield features some big names .
stuttgart 's mauro camaronesi has had a lot of highlights in his career , including winning the italian league title and the world cup .
but he 'll want to forget his time at stuttgart thus far .
brought in to great hoopla in the summer , he ca n't even make the starting line-up of a team that 's wintering in the drop zone .
matt put forward wolfsburg 's josue , a former team captain relegated to the bench , but dw sports writer jefferson chase overruled him in favor of the wolves ' diego .
when you pay some 18 million euros for a star with a history of excellence in the bundesliga , you expect more than a handful of goals with the odd assist thrown in .
the brazilian is also hot-headed and is very lucky not to have gotten sent off this season .
value for money is something else .
another playmaker who 's not making the grade is gladbach 's juan arango .
two goals , three assists and one very foolish red card that cost the foals a chance to get much needed points against hoffenheim are the venezuelan 's sad balance sheet .
as nick succinctly put it ... " atrocious . "
and lest anyone think we 're picking on foreigners , completing our flailing foursome is bremen 's aaron hunt .
the german youngster was charged with replacing mesut oezil this season , and he simply has n't been able to .
this may not be entirely his fault , as he was originally a wing striker and some problems adjusting to a new role could have been expected .
but one thing is already clear : a playmaker , he is not .
the forwards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobadilla may love gladbach , but he has n't done them any favors as everyone knows , strikers run hot and cold , so one player scoring more or less than another is often just a reflection of luck and form , and not a fundamental difference in quality .
in order to make the dw sports worst eleven , a forward had to do more than just not score .
he had to kick up a stink in the process .
for that reason , schalke 's edu gets a free pass , despite being nominated by matt .
ciprian marica , who earned a three-match ban late on , when stuttgart really needed him , attracted jefferson 's ire and almost earned a spot in the hall of shame .
but he still came up short .
that 's because matt made a persuasive argument for hamburg 's paolo guerrero , calling him " among the most delusionally self-important players in the league . "
rarely have fans been treated to so much pouting and gesticulating from a player who has a grand total of two goals to his credit after 17 games .
hamburg had great hopes for the peruvian when they brought him from bayern in 2006 - three-and-a-half years on there 's little doubt that he 's not going to fulfill them .
but even guerrero could n't top the histrionics of gladbach 's raul bobadilla .
apparently after taking anger-management lessons from diego maradona , the argentinian went on a rampage in the foals ' match against hanover in early december .
although his team were leading , bobadilla was so incensed in the first half that he lashed out physically at an opponent and verbally at an official , earning himself a straight red .
gladbach went on to lose the match , and bobilla has been suspended indefinitely .
not what your team needs in the struggle against the drop .
or as nick succinctly put it ... " just plain atrocious . "

they 're not very good .
others combine poor performances with delusions of grandeur and animosity toward the world .
deutsche welle identifies the worst offenders . in goal many players pitch a hissy fit if they get benched , but ex-cologne keeper faryd mondragon took his tantrum to a previously unknown biblical level .
having been relieved of his starting role for poor performances and absence due to international duties , the colombian refused to play at all , and then held a press conference comparing his martyrdom to that of jesus .
cologne are apparently non-believers , shipping the malcontent messiah to philadelphia union in the mls .
cologne fans will be happy that faryd is mondra-gone .
the back line among the poor defenders , one particularly stands out .
germany 's leading football magazine , kicker , has ranked bremen 's mikael silvestre the worst player in the entire league , and he was a consensus choice for that distinction among the deutsche welle sport brain-trust as well .
the frenchman tries hard , but is clearly past his prime and was one major reason for bremen 's sputtering start .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weather in germany has n't suited camoranesi , r paired with him in our porous central defense is gladbach 's anderson .
the 22-year-old brazilian was a major signing for the foals this summer , but he has " led " his new club to a truly laughable record of 47 goals conceded .
as dw sports writer nick amies succinctly put it ... " atrocious . "
on the flailing flanks , we have hamburg 's guy demel .
once a mainstay in northern germany , the ivorian has become , in the words of dw sports editor matt hermann , " a walking lapse in concentration . "
and not only has hamburg coach armin veh removed him from the starting line-up .
he did n't even make the bench in his club 's last match of the year .
joining him is bremen 's petri pasanen .
hamburg 's arch-rivals have always conceded lots of goals for a top side , but this year , the problem is worse than ever .
bremen 's goal difference is a lousy -12 .
opponents encounter little resistance on the wings , and the finnish veteran has simply not been up to the job .
the problem for bremen is that no one else has been , either .
the midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobadilla may love gladbach , but he has n't done them any favors among the candidates put forward for the middle of the pitch were bremen 's marko arnautovic and bayern 's franck ribery , but injuries have somewhat mitigated their poor production .
still , our mediocre midfield features some big names .
stuttgart 's mauro camaronesi has had a lot of highlights in his career , including winning the italian league title and the world cup .
but he 'll want to forget his time at stuttgart thus far .
brought in to great hoopla in the summer , he ca n't even make the starting line-up of a team that 's wintering in the drop zone .
matt put forward wolfsburg 's josue , a former team captain relegated to the bench , but dw sports writer jefferson chase overruled him in favor of the wolves ' diego .
when you pay some 18 million euros for a star with a history of excellence in the bundesliga , you expect more than a handful of goals with the odd assist thrown in .
the brazilian is also hot-headed and is very lucky not to have gotten sent off this season .
value for money is something else .
another playmaker who 's not making the grade is gladbach 's juan arango .
two goals , three assists and one very foolish red card that cost the foals a chance to get much needed points against hoffenheim are the venezuelan 's sad balance sheet .
as nick succinctly put it ... " atrocious . "
and lest anyone think we 're picking on foreigners , completing our flailing foursome is bremen 's aaron hunt .
the german youngster was charged with replacing mesut oezil this season , and he simply has n't been able to .
this may not be entirely his fault , as he was originally a wing striker and some problems adjusting to a new role could have been expected .
but one thing is already clear : a playmaker , he is not .
the forwards # b # as everyone knows , strikers run hot and cold , so one player scoring more or less than another is often just a reflection of luck and form , and not a fundamental difference in quality .
in order to make the dw sports worst eleven , a forward had to do more than just not score .
he had to kick up a stink in the process .
for that reason , schalke 's edu gets a free pass , despite being nominated by matt .
ciprian marica , who earned a three-match ban late on , when stuttgart really needed him , attracted jefferson 's ire and almost earned a spot in the hall of shame .
but he still came up short .
that 's because matt made a persuasive argument for hamburg 's paolo guerrero , calling him " among the most delusionally self-important players in the league . "
rarely have fans been treated to so much pouting and gesticulating from a player who has a grand total of two goals to his credit after 17 games .
hamburg had great hopes for the peruvian when they brought him from bayern in 2006 - three-and-a-half years on there 's little doubt that he 's not going to fulfill them .
but even guerrero could n't top the histrionics of gladbach 's raul bobadilla .
apparently after taking anger-management lessons from diego maradona , the argentinian went on a rampage in the foals ' match against hanover in early december .
although his team were leading , bobadilla was so incensed in the first half that he lashed out physically at an opponent and verbally at an official , earning himself a straight red .
gladbach went on to lose the match , and bobilla has been suspended indefinitely .
not what your team needs in the struggle against the drop .
or as nick succinctly put it ... " just plain atrocious . "

the statement by the military command , carried on the north korean news agency kcna , continued , " the world should properly know who is the true champion of peace and who is the real provocateur of a war . "
south korea fired dozens of artillery rounds during a live-fire exercise from the island of yeonpyeong on monday .
the island lies near the border with north korea , which has threatened retaliation .
after a similar drill last month , north korean military shelled the island , killing four people .
the united nations security council met for an emergency session on sunday over the growing tensions on the korean peninsula , but was unable to come up with a unanimous response to the crisis .
the majority of the 15 council members have insisted " on a clear-cut condemnation of the november 23 attack " by north korea on south korea in an artillery shelling incident , said susan rice , the us envoy to the united nations .
" there was not unanimity on that point , " she said .
russia and china were instead pushing for an ambiguous statement that would not blame north korea for the crisis , she added .
" it is important that we keep in mind that this tense situation springs from one source and one source alone - the consistently provocative behavior of north korea , " she said .
russia , which had demanded the meeting , said a special un envoy was needed to facilitate talks between north and south korea .
according to a draft statement distributed by russia to the other 14 security council members , it instead called for " maximum restraint " by the two sides .
both koreas have warned they will use military means to defend the disputed border zone on the west coast , raising concerns in the international community that the standoff could rapidly escalate .

the attack on the island killed two civilians and two south korean marines .
the south 's latest plans to conduct live-fire drills on the island were backed by the united states . residents there were told to move into shelters .
north korea warned of " catastrophe " if the south went ahead with the military exercise , saying it would trigger all-out conflict on the peninsula .
the yonhap news agency , quoting a south korean government source , reported that pyongyang had raised an alert for artillery units along the west coast .
council split over whether to assign blame western envoys inside sunday 's eight-hour closed door meeting told the reuters news agency , on condition of anonymity , that council members were split over whether to assign blame for the crisis to north korea .
the us , britain , france and non-permanent member japan supported the idea , with russia and china against the move .
the two holdouts eventually revised their draft statement , condemning last month 's attack which ban has called " one of the gravest incidents since the end of the korean war . "
they did not , however , explicitly blame north korea for the attack . russia 's role the russian draft resolution released sunday sought " a resumption of dialogue and resolution of all problems dividing -lsb- the two sides -rsb- exclusively through peaceful diplomatic means . "
in the resolution , russia calls for un secretary general ban ki-moon to " dispatch without delay " a special representative to seoul and pyongyang .
russia called for the emergency meeting on saturday and expressed some anger that it was only to be convened a day later .
the security council is currently led by the us , and a statement said the meeting was organized for sunday so that countries had time to consult with their governments .
commitment to re-admit inspectors according to the television news channel cnn , a us envoy to north korea , bill richardson , had won agreement to re-admit un nuclear weapons inspectors .
but a spokesman for the us state department , philip crowley , said the government was skeptical that north korea would in fact re-admit the inspectors , who were expelled a year ago .
" north korea talks a great game .
they always do .
the real issue is what will they do , " crowley said . author : martin kuebler , thomas sheldrick , michael lawton -lrb- ap , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

welcoming and hopeful faces manning the christmas stands still hope for customers despite this year 's terror warning , icy rain , and swirling snowstorms .
johanna sievers is one of them .
the young student is working for the first time at a traditional christmas market . her booth sells treats imported from the provence region in southern france , including rich almond studded nougat , caramels and chocolates . the newly opened gourmet shop she 's working for hopes to attract more customers through its booth . terror warning but after a government-issued terror warning was released at the end of november , along with news reports that christmas markets might be targeted , some of sievers ' friends expressed concerns about her job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sievers is n't letting security concerns get her down “ when i say i 'm working in a christmas market , many say ' oh my god , really ? ' and they are worried .
i 'm worried too , a little bit , ” she admits .
“ well , the world 's a dangerous place , so why not go to a christmas market ?
you can cross the street and get run over .
that 's actually more likely . ”
many christmas markets are trying to calm fears with a visible police presence and non-uniformed security personnel making their rounds to keep everyone happy - and shopping . as a norwegian tourist picks up a tiny bag of chocolate-covered figs , sievers makes sure to point out the price , 5 euros , explaining that people usually balk at paying that amount for the small bag of handcrafted french sweets .
unfazed , the tourist adds it to her order and also tells sievers to keep the change , not common behavior for berliners .
across town in prenzlauer berg 's scandinavian-themed lucia weihnachtsmarkt , bilgec serdaroglu is charming customers with his friendly demeanor and tasty hand-made goods .
a small but steady stream of customers stops at his stand to taste mustards flavored with whiskey , chilli and even licorice .
he also has vinegars and preserves .
most of his wares are priced at an affordable 2.50 euros . bildunterschrift : private security guards maintain a visible presence at berlin 's markets first rain , then snow serdaroglu , who moved to berlin from hamburg , has been selling at the market for six years , but this is the first year he is at the market with his own company .
he 's excited . still , serdaroglu admits people in the city have a tight grip on their wallets .
" berlin is the capital , but the sad part is that it 's the weakest city economically , " he says .
people have difficulties with money , he adds , and going to the christmas market definitely means spending money . " if i take my children to the christmas market , i have to plan on spending an average of 50 euros , " serdaroglu says .
" can i afford it or not ?
that 's the question .
so i can understand when people are holding back a bit . "
open air markets like this one also suffer from the weather .
first came the rain at the end of november , followed by surprising amounts of snow , which cancelled flights and delayed trains , slowing down locals and tourists alike .
and while visitors to berlin 's christmas markets seem to be taking the terror warnings and weather surprises in stride , they are n't all whipping out their cash .
stands selling hot drinks , snacks and affordable gifts are doing well , but some merchants offering jewelry , pottery and other higher priced items gaze out from their unvisited booths looking bored and frustrated . browsing but not buying from a spot next to a wood-burning stove , visitor frank huehn watches the crowd slowly pass by a stand selling felted boots from switzerland .
many people stop to look and warm their hands , but few purchase the shoes , which cost over 100 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of browsing but not enough buying at stands , merchants say .
huehn , a merchant himself , is n't selling his own sheepskin goods at this christmas market or any other .
“ the question is n't just how many people come and walk around the market ; vendors are interested in how many are shopping , " he says .
" the market can be very busy , with people exhibiting their wares , and visitors browsing , but they are n't necessarily buying anything . "
the rent at holiday markets , huehn argues , is too high for an unpredictable payoff .
committing for the full run of the season is too risky ; he prefers to try his luck at weekly local markets instead . in the last few years , things have changed for small sellers of handmade goods , partly because of the financial crisis and partly because of a new mindset in germany , according to huehn .
“ in my opinion , a majority of today 's 25 and 30-year-olds just do n't have a sense for quality in products and materials , " he says .
" they do n't work with their hands anymore , so they have no idea - they ca n't judge the quality . they just decide on the price . the older people can tell - they can pick something up in their hands and feel the quality , and they 're ready to pay for it .
the young people ca n't . it 's an unfortunate development . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 20.12.2010 techno-skeptic parliamentarians trained to use twitter , facebook großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damien abad , an mep from france , loves twitter a young french member of the european parliament is leading the charge .
advocates hope that the increased use of social networking will get younger europeans interested in what happens in brussels . public apathy is always a big problem for communicators in european union institutions . fewer than half of eligible voters turned out for ep elections in 2009 , continuing a decline that started 30 years ago . but there 's a new breed of european politicians who are tackling the problem of a public disconnect one keystroke at a time .
one of them is damien abad , a 30-year-old member of the european parliament , or mep .
the man from southeastern france says it 's time eu politicians stop just lamenting the lack of interest from constituents and do something about it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european members of parliament are slowly learning how to use facebook so , his idea is to teach his fellow meps what has come all too naturally for people of his generation - using social networking sites like facebook , flickr and twitter as a way to share a personal and informal view of the otherwise obscure european institutions .
" in order for european people to love europe they have to know europe ! "
abad explains .
and in order for european parliamentarians to tweet , they have to know twitter . so abad , who already communicates regularly in 140-character messages , set up a series of educational seminars for his fellow parliamentarians and their staffs to show how and why to use the new social technologies . he thinks it will catch on , but acknowledges , " it 's necessary for us to find the most active meps in order to create a buzz . "
most meps have never heard of twitter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy buzek calls social networking an " opportunity we need to seize . "
but abad 's got an uphill climb .
only about third to a half of members have a twitter account . a survey a year ago showed that 62 percent of parliamentarians had never even heard of twitter or had never used it and did n't intend to .
jerzy buzek , the parliamentary president and polish represntative has set a good example , opening his own twitter account at the beginning of this year . at age 60 , buzek proves it 's not just a technology for the young gadget-crazy crowd . he warmly addressed the first social-media training session , encouraging participation .
" web 2.0 constitutes for us politicians an opportunity we need to seize , " he said in a pre-recorded video message , shown at one of the workshops held earlier this month in brussels .
" with facebook , twitter and other 2.0 tools , we can get reach out to our citizens on a daily , almost personal basis .
i see it every day through my facebook and twitter accounts . "
the keynote lecturer at that same workshop day was vincent ducrey , a well-known online consultant , who advises the french government on its social media policies and has written a book called the " guide of influence . "
ducrey has worked out meticulous models of the 24-hour news cycle and precisely how to use it for maximum messaging effect .
he said technophobe meps should just get over it , for everybody 's sake , not least their own .
" it 's not about a special party , it 's about democracy , " ducrey insists .
" if we want a high level of participation a high level of voters in three years , they need to start to interact , to raise the question of europe as soon as possible .
and twitter is a good way to do it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 62 percent of meps have never heard of twitter connecting person-to-person ducrey says politicians should learn to be tactical but also personable , and should never have an assistant writing their tweets .
one of the believers who 's urging her colleagues to hop on board is marietje schaake , a dutch mep who says she would n't be in brussels at all if it were n't for social media .
she says with a miniscule campaign budget in 2009 , virtually all the outreach in her campaign was , well , virtual .
" obviously you have an idea , " she said .
" people believe in the idea and in you as a person but to reach them and to interact with them and to make sure they know about you , it could only happen through the internet . "
there are others who 've been on the same wavelength , so to speak , for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : member of the european parliament are generally skeptical of social networking europatweets was a service formed during the 2009 parliamentary elections to distribute information regarding the vote .
it has continued and expanded with its partners into a new service called " tweet your mep " in september . the principle here , said belgian co-creator henri lastenouse , is to provoke conversation , for voters to feel their elected representatives are accountable to them and for the whole world to see if they are not , by looking at the public twitter accounts .
lastenouse predicts public officials will increasingly be forced to take this platform seriously .
they 'll also have to adjust to not being in complete control of what happens , lastenouse says , as they are when they just maintain a website and post items to it .
lastenouse says he 's looking forward to the day when the european commissioners are also pressed into keeping twitter accounts and citizens will be able to ask questions directly to , for example , commission president jose manuel barroso .
" with social media , it 's open and that 's a problem because they will have to answer the questions , " he warned .

but silent night – a song known the world over – has very humble origins . silent night 's roots can be traced back to the tiny village of oberndorf in the state of salzburg , austria .
it was written by priest , father joseph mohr , and in its original german form was called , " stille nacht , heilige nacht " , literally , " silent night , holy night . "
mohr 's lyrics were then set to music by schoolteacher franz xaver gruber and the song was first performed in the church of st. nicholas in oberndorf , austria during the christmas service of december 24th 1818 .
unlike the dreamy lullaby we know today , in its original incarnation it was an up-tempo dance tune .
all is calm , all is bright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silent night 's composers : father joseph mohr and franz xaver gruber as mohr 's written reminiscences make no mention of a source of inspiration for the song , its imagined origins have spawned a number of urban myths over the years .
one story has it that the organ in the church of st. nicholas was broken and so a new song had to be hastily written for a different instrument .
another , and perhaps more likely explanation , suggests that mohr simply wanted a new christmas song he could play on his guitar .
the song was translated into english in 1859 by john freeman young , second bishop for the episcopal diocese of florida , and quickly became a popular christmas standard both in religious services and with door-to-door carol singers .
during the 1914 world war i christmas truce , silent night was sung simultaneously by servicemen in english , french and german ; the only song soldiers on both sides of the front line had in common .
sleep in heavenly peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with tourists : the silent night memorial chapel in oberndorf over the decades the song has steadily gained popularity , and has been recorded time and again by pop artists such as the temptations , mahalia jackson and elvis presley .
they each added their own personal touches to the carol , and mahalia jackson ’ s lazy , blues-influenced version even holds the rather unusual honor of being one of the best-selling singles of all time … in norway .
since its first performance on that chilly christmas eve in 1818 , silent night has since been translated into 44 languages and remains , to this day , one of the world ’ s best known and beloved carols .

on monday , the eu imposed a visa ban on gbagbo and 18 other high-ranking officials .
an assets freeze could also come into effect later this week . the us and canada have also threatened to impose sanctions . earlier , un secretary-general ban ki-moon rejected a demand from the contested ivory coast government that un peacekeepers leave the country .
former colonial power france also confirmed that its forces would stay . nations ' human rights chief said sunday that more than 50 people have been killed and " massive violations of human rights " have taken place in ivory coast since thursday . navi pillay , the un high commissioner for human rights , said the un had received reports of hundreds of people being abducted by military and militia members close to laurant gbagbo , some of whom were later found dead . one of gbagbo 's military leaders urged young people to prepare for combat with the un and french peacekeepers .
but ban warned troops loyal to gbagbo not to consider attacking international peacekeepers . " there will be consequences for those who have perpetrated or orchestrated any such actions or do so in the future , " ban said in a statement regarding attacks on troop stationed with the un mission . ban also said he was " deeply concerned " by recent attacks on un patrols , blaming " security forces apparently loyal to mr. gbagbo . " the un has offered details of two attacks in two days on its troops and military observers , with two employees sustaining injuries in the altercations . " we 're going to continue our patrols but we 're not seeking confrontation , " unoci spokesperson hamadoun toure said sunday .

among other tasks , the troops are protecting the capital abidjan 's golf hotel , where opposition presidential candidate ouattara has assembled his own cabinet and is trying to run an alternative government . the united nations , european union , african union and the ivory coast 's election commission all recognize ouattara as the winner of november 's runoff presidential ballot . nevertheless , gbagbo is clinging to his position , supported by a separate national election body , arguing that he won the vote on a technicality .
as incumbent , gbagbo was able to successfully retain the loyalty of the official armed forces and to keep his hold on most government institutions , while ouattara and his supporters have little more than international support . " the international community has spoken with one voice regarding mr. gbagbo 's attempt to hold on to power , " ban said in his statement , indicating a recent pledge of support for ouattara from the west african economic union , ecowas . the election was supposed to be another step on the road to stability for the poor , war-torn country , which was once the engine room of the west african economy . sporadic outbreaks of violence in abidjan have been met with severe military crackdowns , but the situation is largely calm at present .
the un has said it would try to protect civilians in the capital , as well as ouattara 's makeshift headquarters , should the need arise . ban said the un security council planned to meet monday to discuss the situation in ivory coast and review the mandate of the un mission , which will expire on december 31 . author : mark hallam , martin kuebler , rob mudge -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there will be consequences for those who have perpetrated or orchestrated any such actions or do so in the future , " ban said in a statement regarding attacks on troop stationed with the un mission . ban also said he was " deeply concerned " by recent attacks on un patrols , blaming " security forces apparently loyal to mr. gbagbo . " the un has offered details of two attacks in two days on its troops and military observers , with two employees sustaining injuries in the altercations .

among other tasks , the troops are protecting the capital abidjan 's golf hotel , where opposition presidential candidate ouattara has assembled his own cabinet and is trying to run an alternative government . the united nations , european union , african union and the ivory coast 's election commission all recognize ouattara as the winner of november 's runoff presidential ballot . nevertheless , gbagbo is clinging to his position , supported by a separate national election body , arguing that he won the vote on a technicality .
as incumbent , gbagbo was able to successfully retain the loyalty of the official armed forces and to keep his hold on most government institutions , while ouattara and his supporters have little more than international support . " the international community has spoken with one voice regarding mr. gbagbo 's attempt to hold on to power , " ban said in his statement , indicating a recent pledge of support for ouattara from the west african economic union , ecowas . the election was supposed to be another step on the road to stability for the poor , war-torn country , which was once the engine room of the west african economy . sporadic outbreaks of violence in abidjan have been met with severe military crackdowns , but the situation is largely calm at present .
the un has said it would try to protect civilians in the capital , as well as ouattara 's makeshift headquarters , should the need arise . ban said the un security council planned to meet monday to discuss the situation in ivory coast and review the mandate of the un mission , which will expire on december 31 . author : mark hallam , martin kuebler , rob mudge -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the adeptly staged polls were meant to simulate liberalisation without allowing any real democratic change to take place .
this political farce was by no means directed at belarus 's citizens , but at the european public .
after all , the european union has taken a step towards belarus these past months .
but only the ignorant could be surprised and disappointed at the outcome of the election and the brutal oppression of the opposition : anyone who is familiar with the situation in belarus has long been aware of the kind of regime lukashenko has built over the past 16 years .
and they are also aware of the administrative resources the regime used to ensure an outcome of more than 70 percent - an result more or less predicted by lukashenko .
one should n't be under any illusions about lukashenko : there will never be any real democratic reforms in belarus with him in power .
staged for europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel those who now demand an end to europe 's dialogue with lukashenko may prove their moral superiority , but at the same time they make clear that they know nothing about belarus .
it may be difficult to understand , but the eu is right to continue its dialogue with the lukashenko regime despite election fraud and the arrest of hundreds of opposition leaders .
the past 15 years have shown that breaking off talks and isolation are not the solution .
but within the framework of dialogue there must also be room for criticism .
deficits in human and civil rights must be addressed .
the eu 's high representative for foreign affairs , catherine ashton , is right to demand the immediate release of the detained opposition leaders .
split post-soviet society the social situation in belarus is another reason for maintaining this dialogue .
like in most post-soviet states , society there is deeply split : the vast majority of the population are apolitical and simply endure authoritarian policies .
the total political and economic demise that came as a result of the soviet union 's collapse 20 years ago has left its traumatic mark on society and robbed many people of the hope that political change is possible at all .
the fact that the opposition candidates in belarus were so handily defeated must also be due to the fact that their campaigns were so limited and that they were up against the government 's administrative resources .
but it was also due to the fact that people do n't trust them to do a better job than lukashenko and his regime .
only a relatively small part of society advocates political change : mainly well-educated citizens , intellectuals , small business owners and many students , most of whom live in minsk and other large cities .
yesterday in minsk , they took to the streets to support the opposition .
these people want a democratic belarus in europe .
to ensure that their numbers grow in the long term , they should be supported by a relaxing of visa restrictions , granting small consumer loans via the european bank for reconstruction and development as well as civilian projects and cooperation in the educational sector . and that can only be done through dialogue with lukashenko 's regime .

this comes as the government tries to overcome criticism after a string of financial scandals . india 's congress party has promised to combat corruption by fast-tracking court cases .
the occasion was the plenary of the ruling party , marking the 125th year of its foundation .
in a three-day conference that ended monday , and was attended by about 15,000 members , the congress vowed zero tolerance for corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congress president sonia gandhi attacks the opposition party bjp party president sonia gandhi outlined an agenda , including fast-tracking of all cases concerning corruption and full transparency in all procurements and contracts .
" there is merit in instituting a new system of fast-tracking all cases that concern corruption by public servants , including politicians-including all of us , " gandhi stated . telecom license scandal the congress party has been hit by a string of corruption scandals and is going through its roughest political patch in six years since it returned to power . opposition parties stalled the last parliament session demanding the government must undertake a wider investigation into a $ 39 billion telecom license scandal .
addressing the party 's first plenary session , prime minister manmohan singh rejected allegations that he had turned a blind eye to the scandal and said he was ready to be questioned by a parliamentary panel , the public accounts committee , or pac , in the so-called 2g spectrum inquiry . commonwealth games bribery " i would like to state categorically that i have nothing to hide from the public at large .
that like caesar 's wife , the prime minister should be above suspicion , and it is for this reason that i am prepared to appear before the pac even though there is no precedent to that effect , " singh defended himself . bildunterschrift : the commonwealth games earlier this year were also marred by bribery allegations the prime minister also said the government was conducting a " thorough probe " into the commonwealth games organization and 2g spectrum allocation scandals , and no person found guilty would be spared .
in the 2g scam , second-generation telecom licenses were sold by the government for a fraction of their value .
several organizers of the commonwealth games , which were held in delhi in october , have been arrested for graft . attacking sonia gandhi a combative sonia gandhi took on the opposition bharatiya janata party : " it is also our duty to counter all the accusations that are blatantly baseless ; unfounded accusations being leveled by the opposition , particularly by the bjp . " the bjp , for its part , dismissed prime minister singh ’ s offer of appearing before the public accounts committee .
party spokesperson nirmala seetharaman said : " the speech that the president of the congress party has made clearly shows the mentality of a party which is under siege .
the president of the party , sonia gandhi has only tried to deflect the attention of the people of this country who are waiting to hear answers to so many of their failures . " ongoing investigation the opposition wants a joint parliamentary committee to investigate the 2g scandal because it would have the power to call cabinet members to testify .
the scandal has forced the former telecom minister a. raja to resign , although he has denied any wrongdoing . india ’ s supreme court has been holding hearings regularly on this issue , and is expected to rule shortly . author : murali krishnan -lrb- new delhi -rrb- editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 20.12.2010 last throw of the dice for mideast peace , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : netanyahu 's settlement plans alienate obama from abbas a new round of shuttle diplomacy in the middle east has taken place as us envoy george mitchell tries to restart peace negotiations between israel and the palestinians .
however , regional experts remain pessimistic . mitchell held talks with israeli and palestinian officials last week in a desperate attempt to salvage negotiations over a peace deal in the region .
mitchell , who was last in the region in october , was attempting to bring the two sides together for talks for the first time since a 10-month freeze on israeli settlement building on palestinian territory expired at the end of september.the palestinians have refused to engage in peace talks since the moratorium on settlement building ended .
however , the us envoy arrived with little hope of getting palestinian president mahmoud abbas and israeli premier benjamin netanyahu in the same room together with the best hope of progress coming from a reopening of " proximity " talks with the us acting as a go-between .
during his meetings , mitchell suggested a six-week period of " parallel " talks where negotiators would hold separate talks with us officials .
however , the failure of the us to secure a new israeli settlement freeze has not only ended any chance of direct negotiations but has put in jeopardy any prospect of a return to any kind of dialogue .
settlement building is a core issue in the palestinians list of grievances against israel , along with disagreements over borders , security , jerusalem , refugees and the access to water supplies .
netanyahu effectively announced last week that the united states had given up on trying to force israel to abandon its settlement plans .
washington later confirmed it had dropped its bid to persuade israel to renew a partial freeze on west bank settlement construction after israel rejected a package of incentives - including advanced us jet fighters - in exchange for a new three-month ban .
experts believe that the failure of the us in preventing further settlement building has seriously undermined washington 's credibility and ability to broker a deal .
settlement defeat undermines ' weak ' united states bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mitchell -lrb- l . -rrb- arrived just a week after the us admits defeat " the us administration has given up for now on achieving a settlement moratorium which would be essential to stop the further fragmentation of the territory available for a future palestinian state , " dr. murial asseburg , the head of the middle east and africa research division at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" indeed , the israeli government now feels vindicated . "
the us is the only actor accepted by both parties as a broker which has the necessary clout not only to get to an agreement but also to give the necessary security guarantees , she said .
however , the effect of this failure was now clear .
" the us administration is now perceived as being defeated , weak , unwilling and incapable of engaging in consistent and effective diplomacy and of exerting the necessary pressure needed to achieve peace in the region . "
with confidence over the current us approach to the peace process dwindling , there is a growing belief that washington should adapt its policy to the changing realities in the region if it hopes to broker any kind of deal .
however , fawaz gerges , professor of middle eastern politics and international relations at the london school of economics and political science , believes the americans ' hands are now tied by bonds of their own making .
embattled obama leaves arab supporters exposed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's whole foreign policy hinges on middle east peace " president obama has lost the struggle over the settlement issue and has seen the two-state solution , the major plank not only of his middle east strategy but his whole foreign policy , destroyed before his eyes , " he told deutsche welle .
" there is nothing obama can do now ; this is the end of the peace process as it currently exists and we wo n't see any change until the next us presidential election . "
gerges said that obama 's weakened position , both internationally and domestically , has ruled the us out of the equation , leaving israel empowered and the pro-west arabs - including president abbas - dangerously exposed .
the implications of washington 's failure could affect the wider middle east .
" abbas has invested everything in the belief that only the us can deliver in the peace process and that obama was committed to the two-state solution , a belief held by other pro-west arab leaders in the region , " gerges said .
" this has strengthened the hand of the pro-iran arabs - such as syria , hezbollah and hamas - who support the resistance model ; the belief that only resistance can force israel to accept an independent palestinian state . "
gerges went as far as to forecast a return to hostilities before the summer of 2011 .
" it is highly likely that we will see some violence or a return to conflict in the next six months or so , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : without a us commitment , abbas finds himself exposed according to muriel asseburg the seemingly intractable situation leaves three options for the palestinians : " going for a unilateral declaration of statehood , for a ' uniting for peace ' approach through the general assembly or for dissolving the palestinian authority and demanding annexation of the palestinian territories and equal rights in israel - the most frightening option for the israeli government and public . "

but protesters and opposition candidates have taken to the streets - and were met by police . when asked about how he would deal with the demonstrations announced by the opposition for sunday evening , president alexander lukashenko stressed that " everything will be within the framework of the law . "
but , he said just after casting his ballot , " do n't worry , nobody will go out into the street . " thousands of people chose not to agree .
when the polls closed at eight o 'clock in the evening , scores of people were pouring into the central october square , where space was limited because it had been turned into a skating rink .
the mood was upbeat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vladimir neklyayev shortly before being beaten up several of the nine presidential candidates who opposed lukashenko 's bid to stay in power led the meeting , including andrei sannikov and vitaly rymashevsky .

on the way to the meeting , he was attacked by unidentified men clad in black and severely beaten up .
with head injuries he was taken to a hospital .
the sound equipment neklyayev and his aides were carrying to be used at the meeting was taken away from them .
just hours before , neklyayev and four other presidential candidates gathered at the prosecutor 's office to protest against the arrest of several prominent opposition members , including dmitry dashkevich .
the leader of the youth movement molody front was arrested for allegedly having beaten up someone .
dashkevich was one of the chief organizers of the opposition protest .
the situation was increasingly tense , especially after news broke that results of an official exit poll had been released saying that lukashenko could count on some 72 percent of the vote . ' long live belarus ' in october square , the opposition leaders derided the figures , saying that according to their information , the actual support for the president was not more than 30 percent .
the crowd chanted " zhyve belarus , " or " long live belarus , " and cheered at calls for new elections without lukashenko . the former czech president vacav havel sent a note of support to the meeting , which was read aloud .
" my thoughts and those of my friends are with the people in the square , " havel wrote .
" a free belarus must join the european union . " after havel 's words were read out , the crowd started to move in the direction of independence square , where the government and parliament buildings are located .
the crowd had swelled to some 20,000 , maybe more .
attempts by traffic police to stop the demonstrators from marching via one of the main roads in the center of minsk failed .
otherwise , there was no visible police presence at all .
many drivers who got stuck amid the crowds started to signal in support .
demonstrators cheered , embracing each other .
" this is victory , " they shouted .

asked whether this was a breakthrough he said : " i think so .
so many people are fed up with this dictatorship and have gone out into the streets to protest against this play which they call elections .
and yes , this is more or less what i had expected would happen . " in independence square , the only police presence was a car equipped with loudspeakers .
a voice warned the demonstrators that they should disperse or face harsh measures .
journalists were advised to get out of the way .
the crowd cheered at the sound of the church bells of the big red-brick roman catholic church in the square . riot police soon after , the mood changed .
riot police entered the square from adjacent streets .
the situation escalated when a group of youngsters tried unsuccessfully to force the entrance to the government building , in spite of calls from several presidential candidates not to do so and refrain from violent methods . in the hours that followed , the police cleared the square using batons and arresting hundreds of people , who were put in buses and taken in an unknown direction .
andrei sannikov and his wife were beaten up and arrested , as were other presidential candidates .
uniformed and plainclothes policemen detained youngsters as they were leaving the square .
several journalists were injured , and a russian television crew was briefly detained . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander lukaschenko during the night , vladimir neklyayev was lifted from his hospital bed and taken away , as where vitaly rymashevsky and another candidate , grigory kostusev , who had been injured by police .

jaroslav romanchuk , yet another candidate , went into hiding .
access to opposition websites became increasingly difficult during the night , and early in the morning the office of the charter ' 97 opposition website was raided , and its editors arrested .
hundreds of arrests were made during the night in minsk . belarusian television viewers saw hardly anything of the events developing in the center of the capital .
a live talk show devoted to the elections focused on the election victory of alexander lukashenko , which was said to be close to 80 percent of the vote or more , with a turnout of around 80 percent .
viewers could call in to say whether they thought the elections were free and fair , and 94 percent of over 30,000 callers were said to have confirmed this . only briefly , some footage was shown of young people storming the parliament , and of riot police battling with demonstrators .
a high police officer present in the studio announced , under applause , that the square had been cleared and that " this small group " of demonstrators had been dispersed . author : geert groot koerkamp , minsk editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

advocates hope that the increased use of social networking will get younger europeans interested in what happens in brussels . public apathy is always a big problem for communicators in european union institutions . fewer than half of eligible voters turned out for ep elections in 2009 , continuing a decline that started 30 years ago . but there 's a new breed of european politicians who are tackling the problem of a public disconnect one keystroke at a time .
one of them is damien abad , a 30-year-old member of the european parliament , or mep .
the man from southeastern france says it 's time eu politicians stop just lamenting the lack of interest from constituents and do something about it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european members of parliament are slowly learning how to use facebook so , his idea is to teach his fellow meps what has come all too naturally for people of his generation - using social networking sites like facebook , flickr and twitter as a way to share a personal and informal view of the otherwise obscure european institutions .
" in order for european people to love europe they have to know europe ! "
abad explains .
and in order for european parliamentarians to tweet , they have to know twitter . so abad , who already communicates regularly in 140-character messages , set up a series of educational seminars for his fellow parliamentarians and their staffs to show how and why to use the new social technologies . he thinks it will catch on , but acknowledges , " it 's necessary for us to find the most active meps in order to create a buzz . "
most meps have never heard of twitter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy buzek calls social networking an " opportunity we need to seize . "
but abad 's got an uphill climb .
only about third to a half of members have a twitter account . a survey a year ago showed that 62 percent of parliamentarians had never even heard of twitter or had never used it and did n't intend to .
jerzy buzek , the parliamentary president and polish represntative has set a good example , opening his own twitter account at the beginning of this year . at age 60 , buzek proves it 's not just a technology for the young gadget-crazy crowd . he warmly addressed the first social-media training session , encouraging participation .
" web 2.0 constitutes for us politicians an opportunity we need to seize , " he said in a pre-recorded video message , shown at one of the workshops held earlier this month in brussels .
" with facebook , twitter and other 2.0 tools , we can get reach out to our citizens on a daily , almost personal basis .
i see it every day through my facebook and twitter accounts . "
the keynote lecturer at that same workshop day was vincent ducrey , a well-known online consultant , who advises the french government on its social media policies and has written a book called the " guide of influence . "
ducrey has worked out meticulous models of the 24-hour news cycle and precisely how to use it for maximum messaging effect .
he said technophobe meps should just get over it , for everybody 's sake , not least their own .
" it 's not about a special party , it 's about democracy , " ducrey insists .
" if we want a high level of participation a high level of voters in three years , they need to start to interact , to raise the question of europe as soon as possible .
and twitter is a good way to do it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 62 percent of meps have never heard of twitter connecting person-to-person ducrey says politicians should learn to be tactical but also personable , and should never have an assistant writing their tweets .
one of the believers who 's urging her colleagues to hop on board is marietje schaake , a dutch mep who says she would n't be in brussels at all if it were n't for social media .
she says with a miniscule campaign budget in 2009 , virtually all the outreach in her campaign was , well , virtual .
" obviously you have an idea , " she said .
" people believe in the idea and in you as a person but to reach them and to interact with them and to make sure they know about you , it could only happen through the internet . "
there are others who 've been on the same wavelength , so to speak , for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : member of the european parliament are generally skeptical of social networking europatweets was a service formed during the 2009 parliamentary elections to distribute information regarding the vote .
it has continued and expanded with its partners into a new service called " tweet your mep " in september . the principle here , said belgian co-creator henri lastenouse , is to provoke conversation , for voters to feel their elected representatives are accountable to them and for the whole world to see if they are not , by looking at the public twitter accounts .
lastenouse predicts public officials will increasingly be forced to take this platform seriously .
they 'll also have to adjust to not being in complete control of what happens , lastenouse says , as they are when they just maintain a website and post items to it .
lastenouse says he 's looking forward to the day when the european commissioners are also pressed into keeping twitter accounts and citizens will be able to ask questions directly to , for example , commission president jose manuel barroso .
" with social media , it 's open and that 's a problem because they will have to answer the questions , " he warned .

but ngo human rights watch is reporting a new wave of forced recruitment . twenty-one-year-old big is banging on his drums on the outskirts of bukavu , the capital of south kivu province in the eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
big was not always such a talented percussionist .
just five years ago he was handling guns , not drumsticks . big was 12 when he joined an armed group in bukavu . he had just witnessed his brother being killed , and the prospect of revenge and money made joining up seem like a good option .
" i saw other children earning money with the army , so i decided to join , " big said .
" physically , they did n't treat me badly because they wanted me to be a healthy member of the group .
but mentally they were not good to me , they gave me bad ideas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thousand young people have been recruited since september , says human rights watch it 's a choice big now wants to put behind him , and one that many children involved in armed groups - whether as soldiers , servants or sex slaves - never made in the first place .
during the second congo war between 1998 and 2003 , thousands of children voluntarily joined armed groups , or were conscripted or born into them .
although the drc is no longer officially at war , the country remains highly militarized as competition over resources , ethnic disputes and political ideologies sustain conflict . now , a report from non-government organization human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- suggests the number of children being forcibly recruited is again on the rise .
' a thousand boys in four months ' human rights watch researchers found that at least a thousand young men and boys have been forcibly recruited and trained for combat since september .
at least 261 of them were under the age of 18 , says karina tercsakean , a senior researcher with human rights watch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drc government has tried to clamp down on child recruitment , but little has changed " the real number is probably even higher , " she told deutsche welle .
" we 've seen an increase in tensions in eastern drc late this year .
some rebel groups have nominally been integrated into the army , but they maintain their separate structures , so they look to expand their ranks . "
she added that rebel groups fighting the army also appear to be recruiting new child soldiers .
young men are abducted from their homes , or they disappear after officers have paid schools or football pitches a visit , says tercsakean .
some boys are promised money or other benefits .
" what is especially worrying is that some of the young men were demobilized in the past , and now they 're re-recruited , " tercsakean said .
human rights watch is calling on the drc government to step up efforts to stamp out such recruitment .
although the practice contravenes local and international law , perpetrators often go unpunished .
breaking the cycle one group that has been involved in demobilizing children is the association de soutien de l 'opprime -lrb- association for the support of oppressed persons , or aso -rrb- , the drumming and theater group now helping rehabilitate big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after they 've been demobilized , many young boys get re-recruited originally , the group was made up of former child soldiers but has expanded over the years to include other marginalized young people : children who have been raped , accused of witchcraft , or simply abandoned .
" when i started psychosocial activities , we found that the cultural activities such as music and theatre could help the youth start over , " said aso coordinator juvenal muderhwa .
" they forget what they lived and rediscover their culture that was missing . "
often children who have fought with armed groups , been raped or accused of witchcraft are shunned by their family and community .
they are left to fend for themselves and overcome their traumatic past alone , which can make recovery all but impossible .
drumming up support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumming can help overcome trauma " an important factor of overcoming a traumatic event is falling back on one 's social network , " said anna maedl , a clinical psychologist from the university of konstanz , in germany .
" when people feel supported by their community , when they feel that they are loved and that others understand what happened to them and that it was not their fault that will help them a lot . "
many of the children working with aso , including big , now participate in performances designed to tackle stigma and to discourage other children from considering joining armed groups .
" my goal is to change the ideas of young people like me , " big said .
" i also would like -lsb- the communities we visit -rsb- to see that they too can change and develop , just like i did , through art . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel was welcomed back to germany as a hero for most of 2010 , vettel was in the running for the title and came into the final race in abu dhabi in third place .

lord chief justice igor judge said that the use of " unobtrusive , hand held , virtually silent " equipment to give live text updates is unlikely to interfere with the administration of justice .
cameras and recording equipment are barred in british courts , but twitter has been a gray area .
" there is no statutory prohibition on the use of live text-based communications in open court , " the lord chief justice wrote in an interim practice guidance posted to the english judiciary website .
" but before such use is permitted , the court must be satisfied that its use does not pose a danger of interference to the proper administration of justice in the individual case . "

however , a different judge banned the practice after an appeal to a higher court two days later .
priority given to journalists clarifying the confusion england 's and wales ' most senior judicial official , igor judge , said priority would be given to journalists , but in general the use of twitter would be allowed in british courtrooms provided it did n't interfere with court proceedings .
reporting from british courts is tightly controlled , with television coverage and photography prohibited and sound recording allowed only in exceptional circumstances .
assange was freed last week on 200,000 pounds -lrb- 236,000 euros -rrb- bail after three high-profile court appearances .
the judiciary 's final rules will be issued after a consultation process , sometime in the forthcoming months .

they 're not very good .
others combine poor performances with delusions of grandeur and animosity toward the world .
deutsche welle identifies the worst offenders . in goal many players pitch a hissy fit if they get benched , but ex-cologne keeper faryd mondragon took his tantrum to a previously unknown biblical level .
having been relieved of his starting role for poor performances and absence due to international duties , the colombian refused to play at all , and then held a press conference comparing his martyrdom to that of jesus .
cologne are apparently non-believers , shipping the malcontent messiah to philadelphia union in the mls .
cologne fans will be happy that faryd is mondra-gone .
the back line among the poor defenders , one particularly stands out .
germany 's leading football magazine , kicker , has ranked bremen 's mikael silvestre the worst player in the entire league , and he was a consensus choice for that distinction among the deutsche welle sport brain-trust as well .
the frenchman tries hard , but is clearly past his prime and was one major reason for bremen 's sputtering start .
bildunterschrift : silvestre ca n't keep up with the league 's youngsters paired with him in our porous central defense is gladbach 's anderson .
the 22-year-old brazilian was a major signing for the foals this summer , but he has " led " his new club to a truly laughable record of 47 goals conceded .
as dw sports writer nick amies succinctly put it ... " atrocious . "
on the flailing flanks , we have hamburg 's guy demel .
once a mainstay in northern germany , the ivorian has become , in the words of dw sports editor matt hermann , " a walking lapse in concentration . "
and not only has hamburg coach armin veh removed him from the starting line-up .
he did n't even make the bench in his club 's last match of the year .
joining him is bremen 's petri pasanen .
hamburg 's arch-rivals have always conceded lots of goals for a top side , but this year , the problem is worse than ever .
bremen 's goal difference is a lousy -12 .
opponents encounter little resistance on the wings , and the finnish veteran has simply not been up to the job .
the problem for bremen is that no one else has been , either .
the midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weather in germany has n't suited camoranesi , r among the candidates put forward for the middle of the pitch were bremen 's marko arnautovic and bayern 's franck ribery , but injuries have somewhat mitigated their poor production .
still , our mediocre midfield features some big names .
stuttgart 's mauro camaronesi has had a lot of highlights in his career , including winning the italian league title and the world cup .
but he 'll want to forget his time at stuttgart thus far .
brought in to great hoopla in the summer , he ca n't even make the starting line-up of a team that 's wintering in the drop zone .
matt put forward wolfsburg 's josue , a former team captain relegated to the bench , but dw sports writer jefferson chase overruled him in favor of the wolves ' diego .
when you pay some 18 million euros for a star with a history of excellence in the bundesliga , you expect more than a handful of goals with the odd assist thrown in .
the brazilian is also hot-headed and is very lucky not to have gotten sent off this season .
value for money is something else .
another playmaker who 's not making the grade is gladbach 's juan arango .
two goals , three assists and one very foolish red card that cost the foals a chance to get much needed points against hoffenheim are the venezuelan 's sad balance sheet .
as nick succinctly put it ... " atrocious . "
and lest anyone think we 're picking on foreigners , completing our flailing foursome is bremen 's aaron hunt .
the german youngster was charged with replacing mesut oezil this season , and he simply has n't been able to .
this may not be entirely his fault , as he was originally a wing striker and some problems adjusting to a new role could have been expected .
but one thing is already clear : a playmaker , he is not .
the forwards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobadilla may love gladbach , but he has n't done them any favors as everyone knows , strikers run hot and cold , so one player scoring more or less than another is often just a reflection of luck and form , and not a fundamental difference in quality .
in order to make the dw sports worst eleven , a forward had to do more than just not score .
he had to kick up a stink in the process .
for that reason , schalke 's edu gets a free pass , despite being nominated by matt .
ciprian marica , who earned a three-match ban late on , when stuttgart really needed him , attracted jefferson 's ire and almost earned a spot in the hall of shame .
but he still came up short .
that 's because matt made a persuasive argument for hamburg 's paolo guerrero , calling him " among the most delusionally self-important players in the league . "
rarely have fans been treated to so much pouting and gesticulating from a player who has a grand total of two goals to his credit after 17 games .
hamburg had great hopes for the peruvian when they brought him from bayern in 2006 - three-and-a-half years on there 's little doubt that he 's not going to fulfill them .
but even guerrero could n't top the histrionics of gladbach 's raul bobadilla .
apparently after taking anger-management lessons from diego maradona , the argentinian went on a rampage in the foals ' match against hanover in early december .
although his team were leading , bobadilla was so incensed in the first half that he lashed out physically at an opponent and verbally at an official , earning himself a straight red .
gladbach went on to lose the match , and bobilla has been suspended indefinitely .
not what your team needs in the struggle against the drop .
or as nick succinctly put it ... " just plain atrocious . "

but ngo human rights watch is reporting a new wave of forced recruitment . twenty-one-year-old big is banging on his drums on the outskirts of bukavu , the capital of south kivu province in the eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
big was not always such a talented percussionist .
just five years ago he was handling guns , not drumsticks . big was 12 when he joined an armed group in bukavu . he had just witnessed his brother being killed , and the prospect of revenge and money made joining up seem like a good option .
" i saw other children earning money with the army , so i decided to join , " big said .
" physically , they did n't treat me badly because they wanted me to be a healthy member of the group .
but mentally they were not good to me , they gave me bad ideas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thousand young people have been recruited since september , says human rights watch it 's a choice big now wants to put behind him , and one that many children involved in armed groups - whether as soldiers , servants or sex slaves - never made in the first place .
during the second congo war between 1998 and 2003 , thousands of children voluntarily joined armed groups , or were conscripted or born into them .
although the drc is no longer officially at war , the country remains highly militarized as competition over resources , ethnic disputes and political ideologies sustain conflict . now , a report from non-government organization human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- suggests the number of children being forcibly recruited is again on the rise .
' a thousand boys in four months ' human rights watch researchers found that at least a thousand young men and boys have been forcibly recruited and trained for combat since september .
at least 261 of them were under the age of 18 , says karina tercsakean , a senior researcher with human rights watch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drc government has tried to clamp down on child recruitment , but little has changed " the real number is probably even higher , " she told deutsche welle .
" we 've seen an increase in tensions in eastern drc late this year .
some rebel groups have nominally been integrated into the army , but they maintain their separate structures , so they look to expand their ranks . "
she added that rebel groups fighting the army also appear to be recruiting new child soldiers .
young men are abducted from their homes , or they disappear after officers have paid schools or football pitches a visit , says tercsakean .
some boys are promised money or other benefits .
" what is especially worrying is that some of the young men were demobilized in the past , and now they 're re-recruited , " tercsakean said .
human rights watch is calling on the drc government to step up efforts to stamp out such recruitment .
although the practice contravenes local and international law , perpetrators often go unpunished .
breaking the cycle one group that has been involved in demobilizing children is the association de soutien de l 'opprime -lrb- association for the support of oppressed persons , or aso -rrb- , the drumming and theater group now helping rehabilitate big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after they 've been demobilized , many young boys get re-recruited originally , the group was made up of former child soldiers but has expanded over the years to include other marginalized young people : children who have been raped , accused of witchcraft , or simply abandoned .
" when i started psychosocial activities , we found that the cultural activities such as music and theatre could help the youth start over , " said aso coordinator juvenal muderhwa .
" they forget what they lived and rediscover their culture that was missing . "
often children who have fought with armed groups , been raped or accused of witchcraft are shunned by their family and community .
they are left to fend for themselves and overcome their traumatic past alone , which can make recovery all but impossible .
drumming up support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumming can help overcome trauma " an important factor of overcoming a traumatic event is falling back on one 's social network , " said anna maedl , a clinical psychologist from the university of konstanz , in germany .
" when people feel supported by their community , when they feel that they are loved and that others understand what happened to them and that it was not their fault that will help them a lot . "
many of the children working with aso , including big , now participate in performances designed to tackle stigma and to discourage other children from considering joining armed groups .
" my goal is to change the ideas of young people like me , " big said .
" i also would like -lsb- the communities we visit -rsb- to see that they too can change and develop , just like i did , through art . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 20.12.2010 berlin 's christmas markets try to trade cheer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has no shortage of christmas markets facing a terror warning , a slowly recovering economy , and drastic weather , berlin 's more than 50 christmas markets are dealing with more challenges than usual this year . booth lights twinkle , children 's rides whirl and spin , and carols rings out from overhead loudspeakers at the city weihnachtsmarkt in the western part of berlin .
welcoming and hopeful faces manning the christmas stands still hope for customers despite this year 's terror warning , icy rain , and swirling snowstorms .
johanna sievers is one of them .
the young student is working for the first time at a traditional christmas market . her booth sells treats imported from the provence region in southern france , including rich almond studded nougat , caramels and chocolates . the newly opened gourmet shop she 's working for hopes to attract more customers through its booth . terror warning but after a government-issued terror warning was released at the end of november , along with news reports that christmas markets might be targeted , some of sievers ' friends expressed concerns about her job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sievers is n't letting security concerns get her down “ when i say i 'm working in a christmas market , many say ' oh my god , really ? ' and they are worried .
i 'm worried too , a little bit , ” she admits .
“ well , the world 's a dangerous place , so why not go to a christmas market ?
you can cross the street and get run over .
that 's actually more likely . ”
many christmas markets are trying to calm fears with a visible police presence and non-uniformed security personnel making their rounds to keep everyone happy - and shopping . as a norwegian tourist picks up a tiny bag of chocolate-covered figs , sievers makes sure to point out the price , 5 euros , explaining that people usually balk at paying that amount for the small bag of handcrafted french sweets .
unfazed , the tourist adds it to her order and also tells sievers to keep the change , not common behavior for berliners .
across town in prenzlauer berg 's scandinavian-themed lucia weihnachtsmarkt , bilgec serdaroglu is charming customers with his friendly demeanor and tasty hand-made goods .
a small but steady stream of customers stops at his stand to taste mustards flavored with whiskey , chilli and even licorice .
he also has vinegars and preserves .
most of his wares are priced at an affordable 2.50 euros . bildunterschrift : private security guards maintain a visible presence at berlin 's markets first rain , then snow serdaroglu , who moved to berlin from hamburg , has been selling at the market for six years , but this is the first year he is at the market with his own company .
he 's excited . still , serdaroglu admits people in the city have a tight grip on their wallets .
" berlin is the capital , but the sad part is that it 's the weakest city economically , " he says .
people have difficulties with money , he adds , and going to the christmas market definitely means spending money . " if i take my children to the christmas market , i have to plan on spending an average of 50 euros , " serdaroglu says .
" can i afford it or not ?
that 's the question .
so i can understand when people are holding back a bit . "
open air markets like this one also suffer from the weather .
first came the rain at the end of november , followed by surprising amounts of snow , which cancelled flights and delayed trains , slowing down locals and tourists alike .
and while visitors to berlin 's christmas markets seem to be taking the terror warnings and weather surprises in stride , they are n't all whipping out their cash .
stands selling hot drinks , snacks and affordable gifts are doing well , but some merchants offering jewelry , pottery and other higher priced items gaze out from their unvisited booths looking bored and frustrated . browsing but not buying from a spot next to a wood-burning stove , visitor frank huehn watches the crowd slowly pass by a stand selling felted boots from switzerland .
many people stop to look and warm their hands , but few purchase the shoes , which cost over 100 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of browsing but not enough buying at stands , merchants say .
huehn , a merchant himself , is n't selling his own sheepskin goods at this christmas market or any other .
“ the question is n't just how many people come and walk around the market ; vendors are interested in how many are shopping , " he says .
" the market can be very busy , with people exhibiting their wares , and visitors browsing , but they are n't necessarily buying anything . "
the rent at holiday markets , huehn argues , is too high for an unpredictable payoff .
committing for the full run of the season is too risky ; he prefers to try his luck at weekly local markets instead . in the last few years , things have changed for small sellers of handmade goods , partly because of the financial crisis and partly because of a new mindset in germany , according to huehn .
“ in my opinion , a majority of today 's 25 and 30-year-olds just do n't have a sense for quality in products and materials , " he says .
" they do n't work with their hands anymore , so they have no idea - they ca n't judge the quality . they just decide on the price . the older people can tell - they can pick something up in their hands and feel the quality , and they 're ready to pay for it .
the young people ca n't . it 's an unfortunate development . ”

lord chief justice igor judge said that the use of " unobtrusive , hand held , virtually silent " equipment to give live text updates is unlikely to interfere with the administration of justice .
cameras and recording equipment are barred in british courts , but twitter has been a gray area .
" there is no statutory prohibition on the use of live text-based communications in open court , " the lord chief justice wrote in an interim practice guidance posted to the english judiciary website .
" but before such use is permitted , the court must be satisfied that its use does not pose a danger of interference to the proper administration of justice in the individual case . "

priority given to journalists clarifying the confusion england 's and wales ' most senior judicial official , igor judge , said priority would be given to journalists , but in general the use of twitter would be allowed in british courtrooms provided it did n't interfere with court proceedings .
reporting from british courts is tightly controlled , with television coverage and photography prohibited and sound recording allowed only in exceptional circumstances .
assange was freed last week on 200,000 pounds -lrb- 236,000 euros -rrb- bail after three high-profile court appearances .
the judiciary 's final rules will be issued after a consultation process , sometime in the forthcoming months .

germany 's world cup squad took the team prize . every year since 1947 , german sportswriters have cast their ballots on the sunday before christmas for the country 's athletes of the year .
in 2010 , the roughly 1,500 vote-casting journalists nominated two athletes who make their living at break-neck speed for the individual athletes of the year and a certain black and white soccer team who took third place at the world cup in south africa for the team award .
pedal to the metal for much of the year in germany , the biggest headlines to come from the world of formula one racing were about legendary driver michael schumacher 's return to the sport .
but the big news about schumacher was eclipsed at the end of the racing season by sebastian vettel , who won the drivers championship in the last race of the season and became the youngest champion in formula one history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel was welcomed back to germany as a hero for most of 2010 , vettel was in the running for the title and came into the final race in abu dhabi in third place .
but trailing by 15 points to ferrari 's fernando alonso meant winning was a long shot .
in the end though , vettel won the race and alonso finished far enough back that vettel was able to take the title and give german fans a new champion to celebrate .
in baden baden , where the awards ceremony took place , vettel said it was rewarding to be honored with the prize of sportsman of the year .
" the whole year , you 're working so hard , and when you 're rewarded for that at the end - i ca n't even describe how good it feels , " he said at the ceremony .

she won gold in the slalom and combined events over american lindsey vonn , a close friend and one of her biggest competitors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two golds in vancouver made riesch one of germany 's top performers the alpine skier from garmisch-partenkirchen in southern germany is used to winning by small margins , so it was fitting that she barely edged out magdalena neuner for the sportswoman of the year award .
neuner won two golds and a silver in biathlon competitions in vancouver , but was happy to see riesch receive the honor .
" i thought it was going to be her , " said neuner , " i already won it once -lsb- in 2007 -rsb- , and maria had such great performances this year , so for me it was clear and i 'm not disappointed . "
in the current alpine skiing season , riesch and vonn are nearly neck and neck in the leaders ' standings .
vonn has a three point lead on riesch , but both women are well ahead of the rest of the field .
riesch and vonn will vie for the world title at the alpine skiing world championship in garmisch-partenkirchen in february 2011 .
world cup squad germany 's team from the football world cup in south africa was voted team of the year after taking third place in the competition .
but the votes for the national squad reflected their exciting style of play as much as their high finish in the tournament .

" it 's satisfying when you can still impress people enough later in the year -lsb- to vote for you -rsb- , " said loew .
for the german national soccer team , it is the ninth team of the year award .

advocates hope that the increased use of social networking will get younger europeans interested in what happens in brussels . public apathy is always a big problem for communicators in european union institutions . fewer than half of eligible voters turned out for ep elections in 2009 , continuing a decline that started 30 years ago . but there 's a new breed of european politicians who are tackling the problem of a public disconnect one keystroke at a time .
one of them is damien abad , a 30-year-old member of the european parliament , or mep .
the man from southeastern france says it 's time eu politicians stop just lamenting the lack of interest from constituents and do something about it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european members of parliament are slowly learning how to use facebook so , his idea is to teach his fellow meps what has come all too naturally for people of his generation - using social networking sites like facebook , flickr and twitter as a way to share a personal and informal view of the otherwise obscure european institutions .
" in order for european people to love europe they have to know europe ! "
abad explains .
and in order for european parliamentarians to tweet , they have to know twitter . so abad , who already communicates regularly in 140-character messages , set up a series of educational seminars for his fellow parliamentarians and their staffs to show how and why to use the new social technologies . he thinks it will catch on , but acknowledges , " it 's necessary for us to find the most active meps in order to create a buzz . "
most meps have never heard of twitter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy buzek calls social networking an " opportunity we need to seize . "
but abad 's got an uphill climb .
only about third to a half of members have a twitter account . a survey a year ago showed that 62 percent of parliamentarians had never even heard of twitter or had never used it and did n't intend to .
jerzy buzek , the parliamentary president and polish represntative has set a good example , opening his own twitter account at the beginning of this year . at age 60 , buzek proves it 's not just a technology for the young gadget-crazy crowd . he warmly addressed the first social-media training session , encouraging participation .
" web 2.0 constitutes for us politicians an opportunity we need to seize , " he said in a pre-recorded video message , shown at one of the workshops held earlier this month in brussels .
" with facebook , twitter and other 2.0 tools , we can get reach out to our citizens on a daily , almost personal basis .
i see it every day through my facebook and twitter accounts . "
the keynote lecturer at that same workshop day was vincent ducrey , a well-known online consultant , who advises the french government on its social media policies and has written a book called the " guide of influence . "
ducrey has worked out meticulous models of the 24-hour news cycle and precisely how to use it for maximum messaging effect .
he said technophobe meps should just get over it , for everybody 's sake , not least their own .
" it 's not about a special party , it 's about democracy , " ducrey insists .
" if we want a high level of participation a high level of voters in three years , they need to start to interact , to raise the question of europe as soon as possible .
and twitter is a good way to do it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 62 percent of meps have never heard of twitter connecting person-to-person ducrey says politicians should learn to be tactical but also personable , and should never have an assistant writing their tweets .
one of the believers who 's urging her colleagues to hop on board is marietje schaake , a dutch mep who says she would n't be in brussels at all if it were n't for social media .
she says with a miniscule campaign budget in 2009 , virtually all the outreach in her campaign was , well , virtual .
" obviously you have an idea , " she said .
" people believe in the idea and in you as a person but to reach them and to interact with them and to make sure they know about you , it could only happen through the internet . "
there are others who 've been on the same wavelength , so to speak , for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : member of the european parliament are generally skeptical of social networking europatweets was a service formed during the 2009 parliamentary elections to distribute information regarding the vote .
it has continued and expanded with its partners into a new service called " tweet your mep " in september . the principle here , said belgian co-creator henri lastenouse , is to provoke conversation , for voters to feel their elected representatives are accountable to them and for the whole world to see if they are not , by looking at the public twitter accounts .
lastenouse predicts public officials will increasingly be forced to take this platform seriously .
they 'll also have to adjust to not being in complete control of what happens , lastenouse says , as they are when they just maintain a website and post items to it .
lastenouse says he 's looking forward to the day when the european commissioners are also pressed into keeping twitter accounts and citizens will be able to ask questions directly to , for example , commission president jose manuel barroso .
" with social media , it 's open and that 's a problem because they will have to answer the questions , " he warned .

but silent night – a song known the world over – has very humble origins . silent night 's roots can be traced back to the tiny village of oberndorf in the state of salzburg , austria .
it was written by priest , father joseph mohr , and in its original german form was called , " stille nacht , heilige nacht " , literally , " silent night , holy night . "
mohr 's lyrics were then set to music by schoolteacher franz xaver gruber and the song was first performed in the church of st. nicholas in oberndorf , austria during the christmas service of december 24th 1818 .
unlike the dreamy lullaby we know today , in its original incarnation it was an up-tempo dance tune .
all is calm , all is bright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silent night 's composers : father joseph mohr and franz xaver gruber as mohr 's written reminiscences make no mention of a source of inspiration for the song , its imagined origins have spawned a number of urban myths over the years .
one story has it that the organ in the church of st. nicholas was broken and so a new song had to be hastily written for a different instrument .
another , and perhaps more likely explanation , suggests that mohr simply wanted a new christmas song he could play on his guitar .
the song was translated into english in 1859 by john freeman young , second bishop for the episcopal diocese of florida , and quickly became a popular christmas standard both in religious services and with door-to-door carol singers .
during the 1914 world war i christmas truce , silent night was sung simultaneously by servicemen in english , french and german ; the only song soldiers on both sides of the front line had in common .
sleep in heavenly peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with tourists : the silent night memorial chapel in oberndorf over the decades the song has steadily gained popularity , and has been recorded time and again by pop artists such as the temptations , mahalia jackson and elvis presley .
they each added their own personal touches to the carol , and mahalia jackson ’ s lazy , blues-influenced version even holds the rather unusual honor of being one of the best-selling singles of all time … in norway .
since its first performance on that chilly christmas eve in 1818 , silent night has since been translated into 44 languages and remains , to this day , one of the world ’ s best known and beloved carols .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 20.12.2010 child soldier recruitment on the rise , says report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children as young as six are often trained for combat in the eastern democratic republic of congo , a group of former child soldiers are starting to rebuild their lives through drumming and theatre .
but ngo human rights watch is reporting a new wave of forced recruitment . twenty-one-year-old big is banging on his drums on the outskirts of bukavu , the capital of south kivu province in the eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
big was not always such a talented percussionist .
just five years ago he was handling guns , not drumsticks . big was 12 when he joined an armed group in bukavu . he had just witnessed his brother being killed , and the prospect of revenge and money made joining up seem like a good option .
" i saw other children earning money with the army , so i decided to join , " big said .
" physically , they did n't treat me badly because they wanted me to be a healthy member of the group .
but mentally they were not good to me , they gave me bad ideas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thousand young people have been recruited since september , says human rights watch it 's a choice big now wants to put behind him , and one that many children involved in armed groups - whether as soldiers , servants or sex slaves - never made in the first place .
during the second congo war between 1998 and 2003 , thousands of children voluntarily joined armed groups , or were conscripted or born into them .
although the drc is no longer officially at war , the country remains highly militarized as competition over resources , ethnic disputes and political ideologies sustain conflict . now , a report from non-government organization human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- suggests the number of children being forcibly recruited is again on the rise .
' a thousand boys in four months ' human rights watch researchers found that at least a thousand young men and boys have been forcibly recruited and trained for combat since september .
at least 261 of them were under the age of 18 , says karina tercsakean , a senior researcher with human rights watch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drc government has tried to clamp down on child recruitment , but little has changed " the real number is probably even higher , " she told deutsche welle .
" we 've seen an increase in tensions in eastern drc late this year .
some rebel groups have nominally been integrated into the army , but they maintain their separate structures , so they look to expand their ranks . "
she added that rebel groups fighting the army also appear to be recruiting new child soldiers .
young men are abducted from their homes , or they disappear after officers have paid schools or football pitches a visit , says tercsakean .
some boys are promised money or other benefits .
" what is especially worrying is that some of the young men were demobilized in the past , and now they 're re-recruited , " tercsakean said .
human rights watch is calling on the drc government to step up efforts to stamp out such recruitment .
although the practice contravenes local and international law , perpetrators often go unpunished .
breaking the cycle one group that has been involved in demobilizing children is the association de soutien de l 'opprime -lrb- association for the support of oppressed persons , or aso -rrb- , the drumming and theater group now helping rehabilitate big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after they 've been demobilized , many young boys get re-recruited originally , the group was made up of former child soldiers but has expanded over the years to include other marginalized young people : children who have been raped , accused of witchcraft , or simply abandoned .
" when i started psychosocial activities , we found that the cultural activities such as music and theatre could help the youth start over , " said aso coordinator juvenal muderhwa .
" they forget what they lived and rediscover their culture that was missing . "
often children who have fought with armed groups , been raped or accused of witchcraft are shunned by their family and community .
they are left to fend for themselves and overcome their traumatic past alone , which can make recovery all but impossible .
drumming up support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumming can help overcome trauma " an important factor of overcoming a traumatic event is falling back on one 's social network , " said anna maedl , a clinical psychologist from the university of konstanz , in germany .
" when people feel supported by their community , when they feel that they are loved and that others understand what happened to them and that it was not their fault that will help them a lot . "
many of the children working with aso , including big , now participate in performances designed to tackle stigma and to discourage other children from considering joining armed groups .
" my goal is to change the ideas of young people like me , " big said .
" i also would like -lsb- the communities we visit -rsb- to see that they too can change and develop , just like i did , through art . "

welcoming and hopeful faces manning the christmas stands still hope for customers despite this year 's terror warning , icy rain , and swirling snowstorms .
johanna sievers is one of them .
the young student is working for the first time at a traditional christmas market . her booth sells treats imported from the provence region in southern france , including rich almond studded nougat , caramels and chocolates . the newly opened gourmet shop she 's working for hopes to attract more customers through its booth . terror warning but after a government-issued terror warning was released at the end of november , along with news reports that christmas markets might be targeted , some of sievers ' friends expressed concerns about her job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sievers is n't letting security concerns get her down “ when i say i 'm working in a christmas market , many say ' oh my god , really ? ' and they are worried .
i 'm worried too , a little bit , ” she admits .
“ well , the world 's a dangerous place , so why not go to a christmas market ?
you can cross the street and get run over .
that 's actually more likely . ”
many christmas markets are trying to calm fears with a visible police presence and non-uniformed security personnel making their rounds to keep everyone happy - and shopping . as a norwegian tourist picks up a tiny bag of chocolate-covered figs , sievers makes sure to point out the price , 5 euros , explaining that people usually balk at paying that amount for the small bag of handcrafted french sweets .
unfazed , the tourist adds it to her order and also tells sievers to keep the change , not common behavior for berliners .
across town in prenzlauer berg 's scandinavian-themed lucia weihnachtsmarkt , bilgec serdaroglu is charming customers with his friendly demeanor and tasty hand-made goods .
a small but steady stream of customers stops at his stand to taste mustards flavored with whiskey , chilli and even licorice .
he also has vinegars and preserves .
most of his wares are priced at an affordable 2.50 euros . bildunterschrift : private security guards maintain a visible presence at berlin 's markets first rain , then snow serdaroglu , who moved to berlin from hamburg , has been selling at the market for six years , but this is the first year he is at the market with his own company .
he 's excited . still , serdaroglu admits people in the city have a tight grip on their wallets .
" berlin is the capital , but the sad part is that it 's the weakest city economically , " he says .
people have difficulties with money , he adds , and going to the christmas market definitely means spending money . " if i take my children to the christmas market , i have to plan on spending an average of 50 euros , " serdaroglu says .
" can i afford it or not ?
that 's the question .
so i can understand when people are holding back a bit . "
open air markets like this one also suffer from the weather .
first came the rain at the end of november , followed by surprising amounts of snow , which cancelled flights and delayed trains , slowing down locals and tourists alike .
and while visitors to berlin 's christmas markets seem to be taking the terror warnings and weather surprises in stride , they are n't all whipping out their cash .
stands selling hot drinks , snacks and affordable gifts are doing well , but some merchants offering jewelry , pottery and other higher priced items gaze out from their unvisited booths looking bored and frustrated . browsing but not buying from a spot next to a wood-burning stove , visitor frank huehn watches the crowd slowly pass by a stand selling felted boots from switzerland .
many people stop to look and warm their hands , but few purchase the shoes , which cost over 100 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of browsing but not enough buying at stands , merchants say .
huehn , a merchant himself , is n't selling his own sheepskin goods at this christmas market or any other .
“ the question is n't just how many people come and walk around the market ; vendors are interested in how many are shopping , " he says .
" the market can be very busy , with people exhibiting their wares , and visitors browsing , but they are n't necessarily buying anything . "
the rent at holiday markets , huehn argues , is too high for an unpredictable payoff .
committing for the full run of the season is too risky ; he prefers to try his luck at weekly local markets instead . in the last few years , things have changed for small sellers of handmade goods , partly because of the financial crisis and partly because of a new mindset in germany , according to huehn .
“ in my opinion , a majority of today 's 25 and 30-year-olds just do n't have a sense for quality in products and materials , " he says .
" they do n't work with their hands anymore , so they have no idea - they ca n't judge the quality . they just decide on the price . the older people can tell - they can pick something up in their hands and feel the quality , and they 're ready to pay for it .
the young people ca n't . it 's an unfortunate development . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 20.12.2010 techno-skeptic parliamentarians trained to use twitter , facebook großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : damien abad , an mep from france , loves twitter a young french member of the european parliament is leading the charge .
advocates hope that the increased use of social networking will get younger europeans interested in what happens in brussels . public apathy is always a big problem for communicators in european union institutions . fewer than half of eligible voters turned out for ep elections in 2009 , continuing a decline that started 30 years ago . but there 's a new breed of european politicians who are tackling the problem of a public disconnect one keystroke at a time .
one of them is damien abad , a 30-year-old member of the european parliament , or mep .
the man from southeastern france says it 's time eu politicians stop just lamenting the lack of interest from constituents and do something about it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european members of parliament are slowly learning how to use facebook so , his idea is to teach his fellow meps what has come all too naturally for people of his generation - using social networking sites like facebook , flickr and twitter as a way to share a personal and informal view of the otherwise obscure european institutions .
" in order for european people to love europe they have to know europe ! "
abad explains .
and in order for european parliamentarians to tweet , they have to know twitter . so abad , who already communicates regularly in 140-character messages , set up a series of educational seminars for his fellow parliamentarians and their staffs to show how and why to use the new social technologies . he thinks it will catch on , but acknowledges , " it 's necessary for us to find the most active meps in order to create a buzz . "
most meps have never heard of twitter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy buzek calls social networking an " opportunity we need to seize . "
but abad 's got an uphill climb .
only about third to a half of members have a twitter account . a survey a year ago showed that 62 percent of parliamentarians had never even heard of twitter or had never used it and did n't intend to .
jerzy buzek , the parliamentary president and polish represntative has set a good example , opening his own twitter account at the beginning of this year . at age 60 , buzek proves it 's not just a technology for the young gadget-crazy crowd . he warmly addressed the first social-media training session , encouraging participation .
" web 2.0 constitutes for us politicians an opportunity we need to seize , " he said in a pre-recorded video message , shown at one of the workshops held earlier this month in brussels .
" with facebook , twitter and other 2.0 tools , we can get reach out to our citizens on a daily , almost personal basis .
i see it every day through my facebook and twitter accounts . "
the keynote lecturer at that same workshop day was vincent ducrey , a well-known online consultant , who advises the french government on its social media policies and has written a book called the " guide of influence . "
ducrey has worked out meticulous models of the 24-hour news cycle and precisely how to use it for maximum messaging effect .
he said technophobe meps should just get over it , for everybody 's sake , not least their own .
" it 's not about a special party , it 's about democracy , " ducrey insists .
" if we want a high level of participation a high level of voters in three years , they need to start to interact , to raise the question of europe as soon as possible .
and twitter is a good way to do it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 62 percent of meps have never heard of twitter connecting person-to-person ducrey says politicians should learn to be tactical but also personable , and should never have an assistant writing their tweets .
one of the believers who 's urging her colleagues to hop on board is marietje schaake , a dutch mep who says she would n't be in brussels at all if it were n't for social media .
she says with a miniscule campaign budget in 2009 , virtually all the outreach in her campaign was , well , virtual .
" obviously you have an idea , " she said .
" people believe in the idea and in you as a person but to reach them and to interact with them and to make sure they know about you , it could only happen through the internet . "
there are others who 've been on the same wavelength , so to speak , for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : member of the european parliament are generally skeptical of social networking europatweets was a service formed during the 2009 parliamentary elections to distribute information regarding the vote .
it has continued and expanded with its partners into a new service called " tweet your mep " in september . the principle here , said belgian co-creator henri lastenouse , is to provoke conversation , for voters to feel their elected representatives are accountable to them and for the whole world to see if they are not , by looking at the public twitter accounts .
lastenouse predicts public officials will increasingly be forced to take this platform seriously .
they 'll also have to adjust to not being in complete control of what happens , lastenouse says , as they are when they just maintain a website and post items to it .
lastenouse says he 's looking forward to the day when the european commissioners are also pressed into keeping twitter accounts and citizens will be able to ask questions directly to , for example , commission president jose manuel barroso .
" with social media , it 's open and that 's a problem because they will have to answer the questions , " he warned .

on monday , the eu imposed a visa ban on gbagbo and 18 other high-ranking officials .
an assets freeze could also come into effect later this week . the us and canada have also threatened to impose sanctions . earlier , un secretary-general ban ki-moon rejected a demand from the contested ivory coast government that un peacekeepers leave the country .
former colonial power france also confirmed that its forces would stay . nations ' human rights chief said sunday that more than 50 people have been killed and " massive violations of human rights " have taken place in ivory coast since thursday . navi pillay , the un high commissioner for human rights , said the un had received reports of hundreds of people being abducted by military and militia members close to laurant gbagbo , some of whom were later found dead . one of gbagbo 's military leaders urged young people to prepare for combat with the un and french peacekeepers .
but ban warned troops loyal to gbagbo not to consider attacking international peacekeepers . " there will be consequences for those who have perpetrated or orchestrated any such actions or do so in the future , " ban said in a statement regarding attacks on troop stationed with the un mission . ban also said he was " deeply concerned " by recent attacks on un patrols , blaming " security forces apparently loyal to mr. gbagbo .

the un has said it would try to protect civilians in the capital , as well as ouattara 's makeshift headquarters , should the need arise . ban said the un security council planned to meet monday to discuss the situation in ivory coast and review the mandate of the un mission , which will expire on december 31 . author : mark hallam , martin kuebler , rob mudge -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the international community has spoken with one voice regarding mr. gbagbo 's attempt to hold on to power , " ban said in his statement , indicating a recent pledge of support for ouattara from the west african economic union , ecowas . the election was supposed to be another step on the road to stability for the poor , war-torn country , which was once the engine room of the west african economy . sporadic outbreaks of violence in abidjan have been met with severe military crackdowns , but the situation is largely calm at present .
the un has said it would try to protect civilians in the capital , as well as ouattara 's makeshift headquarters , should the need arise . ban said the un security council planned to meet monday to discuss the situation in ivory coast and review the mandate of the un mission , which will expire on december 31 . author : mark hallam , martin kuebler , rob mudge -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but silent night – a song known the world over – has very humble origins . silent night 's roots can be traced back to the tiny village of oberndorf in the state of salzburg , austria .
it was written by priest , father joseph mohr , and in its original german form was called , " stille nacht , heilige nacht " , literally , " silent night , holy night . "
mohr 's lyrics were then set to music by schoolteacher franz xaver gruber and the song was first performed in the church of st. nicholas in oberndorf , austria during the christmas service of december 24th 1818 .
unlike the dreamy lullaby we know today , in its original incarnation it was an up-tempo dance tune .
all is calm , all is bright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silent night 's composers : father joseph mohr and franz xaver gruber as mohr 's written reminiscences make no mention of a source of inspiration for the song , its imagined origins have spawned a number of urban myths over the years .
one story has it that the organ in the church of st. nicholas was broken and so a new song had to be hastily written for a different instrument .
another , and perhaps more likely explanation , suggests that mohr simply wanted a new christmas song he could play on his guitar .
the song was translated into english in 1859 by john freeman young , second bishop for the episcopal diocese of florida , and quickly became a popular christmas standard both in religious services and with door-to-door carol singers .
during the 1914 world war i christmas truce , silent night was sung simultaneously by servicemen in english , french and german ; the only song soldiers on both sides of the front line had in common .
sleep in heavenly peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with tourists : the silent night memorial chapel in oberndorf over the decades the song has steadily gained popularity , and has been recorded time and again by pop artists such as the temptations , mahalia jackson and elvis presley .
they each added their own personal touches to the carol , and mahalia jackson ’ s lazy , blues-influenced version even holds the rather unusual honor of being one of the best-selling singles of all time … in norway .
since its first performance on that chilly christmas eve in 1818 , silent night has since been translated into 44 languages and remains , to this day , one of the world ’ s best known and beloved carols .

but many observers on the ground say that not much has changed for the better . the dutch researcher and afghanistan expert alex strick van linschoten is one of the few westerners who live in kandahar . he is the co-editor of ' my life with the taliban , ' a book about mullah abdul salam zaeef , the taliban ’ s ambassador to pakistan in 2001 .
he 's currently working on a study on the links between the taliban and al-qaeda , which will be published in conjunction with the center on international cooperation , new york university . deutsche welle : the us troop surge has been visible in the south of afghanistan since the spring of 2010 .
what effect has it had so far on kandahar ? alex strick van linschoten : in some ways , nothing has changed .
there have been foreign troops in and outside kandahar city for several years .
but there are some cosmetic shifts .
you have a lot of traffic jams in the city now .
before , there used to be mainly canadian troops in kandahar , and they would drive around the city so that they would n't cause traffic jams .
this helped to protect them -lrb- as well as locals in the area -rrb- from being hit by ieds -lrb- improvised explosive devices -rrb- .
but now the americans drive straight through the city .
so when an ied goes off , people blame the americans for driving through .
they do n't blame the taliban for placing the bomb .
you also have much more air traffic compared to the last year .
what is the population 's reaction to the conflict ? there are all sorts of things that resonate badly with the people .
i spoke to a cameraman who was embedded with the us troops in arghandab district for a documentary .
he mentioned the case of a us commander who went to a village telling the elders , " you have to show us where all the ieds and mines are , in and around your village .
if not , i 'm going to bombard your village . "
the elders said , " we do n't know where they are . " the local population feels reminded of the soviet times , when there was a concept of collective responsibility as well - something actually forbidden by the 1949 geneva convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war .
how would you describe the situation in kandahar ? people are depressed .
the younger ones are trying to leave .
just a few days ago , two deputy directors of departments were assassinated .
anyone who works for the government is being threatened .
the taliban now have a commission in the city calling on people to leave their jobs .
they know exactly who is doing what .
there is no way that the afghan government or the americans can protect all the people .
the military certainly ca n't pay enough for civilians to risk their lives for a government that no one really believes is going to survive in the present form .
how do the taliban operate in town ? they have a mediation commission .
when you get a ' night letter ' , for example from the taliban , warning the locals not to work with what the taliban call the occupiers , you can object to this letter , arguing that you have n't done anything wrong .
it is their own ' hearts and minds ' campaign .
on the other hand , i do n't see too much of the ideological side in kandahar .
yes , islam is a motivating factor for the insurgency , but i never really found that islam was the main motivating factor for the taliban in the south .
there are many other factors that people think of and talk about before islam .
the us military and government say that they have gained ' momentum ' and that they see progress ... my sense is that general petraeus thinks that he can win the war militarily .
i think he may be overestimating his ability to achieve this goal , and underestimating at the same time the effect it has on the taliban .
i do n't think petraeus has a serious interest in a settlement that sees the taliban as a part of afghan society .
was the strategy of petraeus ' predecessor more promising ? compared to petraeus , mcchrystal seemed like he understood things far better and had a better appreciation of the effects of us military actions .
you can see it in the number of night raids .
when you look at the isaf statistics , about the day after petraeus arrived there was a massive spike in night raids .
petraeus has also restarted the air war .
in november , compared to the last year , three times as many bombs were dropped on afghanistan . to what extent is the western and afghan military strategy hurting the taliban ?
how do they react ? the night raids certainly have an effect .
they catch or kill a lot of them .
but it does n't seem to have either irrevocably damaged their morale or their ability to carry out attacks .
there does n't seem to be a change in the number of assassinations in the city .
it is tough for the taliban , but they will come back in spring and start all over again . some argue that the taliban are about to change and possibly get more radical as a result of the war .
do you agree ? you can see it in terms of their tactics in the number of beheadings .
that would not have happened before .
it is the same in terms of their attitude to authority , killing elders for example , and also talking back to quetta , the senior leadership , in not being completely subservient to them .
you see it in the general fragmentation also : the taliban shadow governor in kandahar city does n't have control over all taliban groups any more .
a lot of civilian killings in the city are n't ordered from quetta . they often comes from small groups .
some may be pushed by pakistan .
but you have a lot more voices now than before .
what does that mean for the months ahead ? the worry , of course , is that all of these things may eventually lead to a sort of taliban that will look more to an international ' jihad ' with younger people in charge on the side of the insurgency , who have only lived in conflict and war , and who do n't even remember the old afghanistan , or the meaning of peace , from before the soviet war .

but silent night – a song known the world over – has very humble origins . silent night 's roots can be traced back to the tiny village of oberndorf in the state of salzburg , austria .
it was written by priest , father joseph mohr , and in its original german form was called , " stille nacht , heilige nacht " , literally , " silent night , holy night . "
mohr 's lyrics were then set to music by schoolteacher franz xaver gruber and the song was first performed in the church of st. nicholas in oberndorf , austria during the christmas service of december 24th 1818 .
unlike the dreamy lullaby we know today , in its original incarnation it was an up-tempo dance tune .
all is calm , all is bright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silent night 's composers : father joseph mohr and franz xaver gruber as mohr 's written reminiscences make no mention of a source of inspiration for the song , its imagined origins have spawned a number of urban myths over the years .
one story has it that the organ in the church of st. nicholas was broken and so a new song had to be hastily written for a different instrument .
another , and perhaps more likely explanation , suggests that mohr simply wanted a new christmas song he could play on his guitar .
the song was translated into english in 1859 by john freeman young , second bishop for the episcopal diocese of florida , and quickly became a popular christmas standard both in religious services and with door-to-door carol singers .
during the 1914 world war i christmas truce , silent night was sung simultaneously by servicemen in english , french and german ; the only song soldiers on both sides of the front line had in common .
sleep in heavenly peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with tourists : the silent night memorial chapel in oberndorf over the decades the song has steadily gained popularity , and has been recorded time and again by pop artists such as the temptations , mahalia jackson and elvis presley .
they each added their own personal touches to the carol , and mahalia jackson ’ s lazy , blues-influenced version even holds the rather unusual honor of being one of the best-selling singles of all time … in norway .
since its first performance on that chilly christmas eve in 1818 , silent night has since been translated into 44 languages and remains , to this day , one of the world ’ s best known and beloved carols .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 20.12.2010 berlin 's christmas markets try to trade cheer großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has no shortage of christmas markets facing a terror warning , a slowly recovering economy , and drastic weather , berlin 's more than 50 christmas markets are dealing with more challenges than usual this year . booth lights twinkle , children 's rides whirl and spin , and carols rings out from overhead loudspeakers at the city weihnachtsmarkt in the western part of berlin .
welcoming and hopeful faces manning the christmas stands still hope for customers despite this year 's terror warning , icy rain , and swirling snowstorms .
johanna sievers is one of them .
the young student is working for the first time at a traditional christmas market . her booth sells treats imported from the provence region in southern france , including rich almond studded nougat , caramels and chocolates . the newly opened gourmet shop she 's working for hopes to attract more customers through its booth . terror warning but after a government-issued terror warning was released at the end of november , along with news reports that christmas markets might be targeted , some of sievers ' friends expressed concerns about her job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sievers is n't letting security concerns get her down “ when i say i 'm working in a christmas market , many say ' oh my god , really ? ' and they are worried .
i 'm worried too , a little bit , ” she admits .
“ well , the world 's a dangerous place , so why not go to a christmas market ?
you can cross the street and get run over .
that 's actually more likely . ”
many christmas markets are trying to calm fears with a visible police presence and non-uniformed security personnel making their rounds to keep everyone happy - and shopping . as a norwegian tourist picks up a tiny bag of chocolate-covered figs , sievers makes sure to point out the price , 5 euros , explaining that people usually balk at paying that amount for the small bag of handcrafted french sweets .
unfazed , the tourist adds it to her order and also tells sievers to keep the change , not common behavior for berliners .
across town in prenzlauer berg 's scandinavian-themed lucia weihnachtsmarkt , bilgec serdaroglu is charming customers with his friendly demeanor and tasty hand-made goods .
a small but steady stream of customers stops at his stand to taste mustards flavored with whiskey , chilli and even licorice .
he also has vinegars and preserves .
most of his wares are priced at an affordable 2.50 euros . bildunterschrift : private security guards maintain a visible presence at berlin 's markets first rain , then snow serdaroglu , who moved to berlin from hamburg , has been selling at the market for six years , but this is the first year he is at the market with his own company .
he 's excited . still , serdaroglu admits people in the city have a tight grip on their wallets .
" berlin is the capital , but the sad part is that it 's the weakest city economically , " he says .
people have difficulties with money , he adds , and going to the christmas market definitely means spending money . " if i take my children to the christmas market , i have to plan on spending an average of 50 euros , " serdaroglu says .
" can i afford it or not ?
that 's the question .
so i can understand when people are holding back a bit . "
open air markets like this one also suffer from the weather .
first came the rain at the end of november , followed by surprising amounts of snow , which cancelled flights and delayed trains , slowing down locals and tourists alike .
and while visitors to berlin 's christmas markets seem to be taking the terror warnings and weather surprises in stride , they are n't all whipping out their cash .
stands selling hot drinks , snacks and affordable gifts are doing well , but some merchants offering jewelry , pottery and other higher priced items gaze out from their unvisited booths looking bored and frustrated . browsing but not buying from a spot next to a wood-burning stove , visitor frank huehn watches the crowd slowly pass by a stand selling felted boots from switzerland .
many people stop to look and warm their hands , but few purchase the shoes , which cost over 100 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of browsing but not enough buying at stands , merchants say .
huehn , a merchant himself , is n't selling his own sheepskin goods at this christmas market or any other .
“ the question is n't just how many people come and walk around the market ; vendors are interested in how many are shopping , " he says .
" the market can be very busy , with people exhibiting their wares , and visitors browsing , but they are n't necessarily buying anything . "
the rent at holiday markets , huehn argues , is too high for an unpredictable payoff .
committing for the full run of the season is too risky ; he prefers to try his luck at weekly local markets instead . in the last few years , things have changed for small sellers of handmade goods , partly because of the financial crisis and partly because of a new mindset in germany , according to huehn .
“ in my opinion , a majority of today 's 25 and 30-year-olds just do n't have a sense for quality in products and materials , " he says .
" they do n't work with their hands anymore , so they have no idea - they ca n't judge the quality . they just decide on the price . the older people can tell - they can pick something up in their hands and feel the quality , and they 're ready to pay for it .
the young people ca n't . it 's an unfortunate development . ”

johanna sievers is one of them .
the young student is working for the first time at a traditional christmas market . her booth sells treats imported from the provence region in southern france , including rich almond studded nougat , caramels and chocolates . the newly opened gourmet shop she 's working for hopes to attract more customers through its booth . terror warning but after a government-issued terror warning was released at the end of november , along with news reports that christmas markets might be targeted , some of sievers ' friends expressed concerns about her job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sievers is n't letting security concerns get her down “ when i say i 'm working in a christmas market , many say ' oh my god , really ? ' and they are worried .
i 'm worried too , a little bit , ” she admits .
“ well , the world 's a dangerous place , so why not go to a christmas market ?
you can cross the street and get run over .
that 's actually more likely . ”
many christmas markets are trying to calm fears with a visible police presence and non-uniformed security personnel making their rounds to keep everyone happy - and shopping . as a norwegian tourist picks up a tiny bag of chocolate-covered figs , sievers makes sure to point out the price , 5 euros , explaining that people usually balk at paying that amount for the small bag of handcrafted french sweets .

" berlin is the capital , but the sad part is that it 's the weakest city economically , " he says .
people have difficulties with money , he adds , and going to the christmas market definitely means spending money . " if i take my children to the christmas market , i have to plan on spending an average of 50 euros , " serdaroglu says .
" can i afford it or not ?
that 's the question .
so i can understand when people are holding back a bit . "
open air markets like this one also suffer from the weather .

and while visitors to berlin 's christmas markets seem to be taking the terror warnings and weather surprises in stride , they are n't all whipping out their cash .
stands selling hot drinks , snacks and affordable gifts are doing well , but some merchants offering jewelry , pottery and other higher priced items gaze out from their unvisited booths looking bored and frustrated . browsing but not buying from a spot next to a wood-burning stove , visitor frank huehn watches the crowd slowly pass by a stand selling felted boots from switzerland .

huehn , a merchant himself , is n't selling his own sheepskin goods at this christmas market or any other .

" the market can be very busy , with people exhibiting their wares , and visitors browsing , but they are n't necessarily buying anything . "
the rent at holiday markets , huehn argues , is too high for an unpredictable payoff .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 20.12.2010 view from kandahar : ' petraeus believes in military victory ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kandahar : a war-torn city according to the us annual strategy review , the us troop surge in afghanistan has been partly successful .
but many observers on the ground say that not much has changed for the better . the dutch researcher and afghanistan expert alex strick van linschoten is one of the few westerners who live in kandahar . he is the co-editor of ' my life with the taliban , ' a book about mullah abdul salam zaeef , the taliban ’ s ambassador to pakistan in 2001 .
he 's currently working on a study on the links between the taliban and al-qaeda , which will be published in conjunction with the center on international cooperation , new york university . deutsche welle : the us troop surge has been visible in the south of afghanistan since the spring of 2010 .
what effect has it had so far on kandahar ? alex strick van linschoten : in some ways , nothing has changed .
there have been foreign troops in and outside kandahar city for several years .
but there are some cosmetic shifts .
you have a lot of traffic jams in the city now .
before , there used to be mainly canadian troops in kandahar , and they would drive around the city so that they would n't cause traffic jams .
this helped to protect them -lrb- as well as locals in the area -rrb- from being hit by ieds -lrb- improvised explosive devices -rrb- .
but now the americans drive straight through the city .
so when an ied goes off , people blame the americans for driving through .
they do n't blame the taliban for placing the bomb .
you also have much more air traffic compared to the last year .
what is the population 's reaction to the conflict ? there are all sorts of things that resonate badly with the people .
i spoke to a cameraman who was embedded with the us troops in arghandab district for a documentary .
he mentioned the case of a us commander who went to a village telling the elders , " you have to show us where all the ieds and mines are , in and around your village .
if not , i 'm going to bombard your village . "
the elders said , " we do n't know where they are . " the local population feels reminded of the soviet times , when there was a concept of collective responsibility as well - something actually forbidden by the 1949 geneva convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war .
how would you describe the situation in kandahar ? people are depressed .
the younger ones are trying to leave .
just a few days ago , two deputy directors of departments were assassinated .
anyone who works for the government is being threatened .
the taliban now have a commission in the city calling on people to leave their jobs .
they know exactly who is doing what .
there is no way that the afghan government or the americans can protect all the people .
the military certainly ca n't pay enough for civilians to risk their lives for a government that no one really believes is going to survive in the present form .
how do the taliban operate in town ? they have a mediation commission .
when you get a ' night letter ' , for example from the taliban , warning the locals not to work with what the taliban call the occupiers , you can object to this letter , arguing that you have n't done anything wrong .
it is their own ' hearts and minds ' campaign .
on the other hand , i do n't see too much of the ideological side in kandahar .
yes , islam is a motivating factor for the insurgency , but i never really found that islam was the main motivating factor for the taliban in the south .
there are many other factors that people think of and talk about before islam .
the us military and government say that they have gained ' momentum ' and that they see progress ... my sense is that general petraeus thinks that he can win the war militarily .
i think he may be overestimating his ability to achieve this goal , and underestimating at the same time the effect it has on the taliban .
i do n't think petraeus has a serious interest in a settlement that sees the taliban as a part of afghan society .
was the strategy of petraeus ' predecessor more promising ? compared to petraeus , mcchrystal seemed like he understood things far better and had a better appreciation of the effects of us military actions .
you can see it in the number of night raids .
when you look at the isaf statistics , about the day after petraeus arrived there was a massive spike in night raids .
petraeus has also restarted the air war .
in november , compared to the last year , three times as many bombs were dropped on afghanistan . to what extent is the western and afghan military strategy hurting the taliban ?
how do they react ? the night raids certainly have an effect .
they catch or kill a lot of them .
but it does n't seem to have either irrevocably damaged their morale or their ability to carry out attacks .
there does n't seem to be a change in the number of assassinations in the city .
it is tough for the taliban , but they will come back in spring and start all over again . some argue that the taliban are about to change and possibly get more radical as a result of the war .
do you agree ? you can see it in terms of their tactics in the number of beheadings .
that would not have happened before .
it is the same in terms of their attitude to authority , killing elders for example , and also talking back to quetta , the senior leadership , in not being completely subservient to them .
you see it in the general fragmentation also : the taliban shadow governor in kandahar city does n't have control over all taliban groups any more .
a lot of civilian killings in the city are n't ordered from quetta . they often comes from small groups .
some may be pushed by pakistan .
but you have a lot more voices now than before .
what does that mean for the months ahead ? the worry , of course , is that all of these things may eventually lead to a sort of taliban that will look more to an international ' jihad ' with younger people in charge on the side of the insurgency , who have only lived in conflict and war , and who do n't even remember the old afghanistan , or the meaning of peace , from before the soviet war .

but many observers on the ground say that not much has changed for the better . the dutch researcher and afghanistan expert alex strick van linschoten is one of the few westerners who live in kandahar . he is the co-editor of ' my life with the taliban , ' a book about mullah abdul salam zaeef , the taliban ’ s ambassador to pakistan in 2001 .
he 's currently working on a study on the links between the taliban and al-qaeda , which will be published in conjunction with the center on international cooperation , new york university . deutsche welle : the us troop surge has been visible in the south of afghanistan since the spring of 2010 .
what effect has it had so far on kandahar ? alex strick van linschoten : in some ways , nothing has changed .
there have been foreign troops in and outside kandahar city for several years .
but there are some cosmetic shifts .
you have a lot of traffic jams in the city now .
before , there used to be mainly canadian troops in kandahar , and they would drive around the city so that they would n't cause traffic jams .
this helped to protect them -lrb- as well as locals in the area -rrb- from being hit by ieds -lrb- improvised explosive devices -rrb- .
but now the americans drive straight through the city .
so when an ied goes off , people blame the americans for driving through .
they do n't blame the taliban for placing the bomb .
you also have much more air traffic compared to the last year .
what is the population 's reaction to the conflict ? there are all sorts of things that resonate badly with the people .
i spoke to a cameraman who was embedded with the us troops in arghandab district for a documentary .
he mentioned the case of a us commander who went to a village telling the elders , " you have to show us where all the ieds and mines are , in and around your village .
if not , i 'm going to bombard your village . "
the elders said , " we do n't know where they are . " the local population feels reminded of the soviet times , when there was a concept of collective responsibility as well - something actually forbidden by the 1949 geneva convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war .
how would you describe the situation in kandahar ? people are depressed .
the younger ones are trying to leave .
just a few days ago , two deputy directors of departments were assassinated .
anyone who works for the government is being threatened .
the taliban now have a commission in the city calling on people to leave their jobs .
they know exactly who is doing what .
there is no way that the afghan government or the americans can protect all the people .
the military certainly ca n't pay enough for civilians to risk their lives for a government that no one really believes is going to survive in the present form .
how do the taliban operate in town ? they have a mediation commission .
when you get a ' night letter ' , for example from the taliban , warning the locals not to work with what the taliban call the occupiers , you can object to this letter , arguing that you have n't done anything wrong .
it is their own ' hearts and minds ' campaign .
on the other hand , i do n't see too much of the ideological side in kandahar .
yes , islam is a motivating factor for the insurgency , but i never really found that islam was the main motivating factor for the taliban in the south .
there are many other factors that people think of and talk about before islam .
the us military and government say that they have gained ' momentum ' and that they see progress ... my sense is that general petraeus thinks that he can win the war militarily .
i think he may be overestimating his ability to achieve this goal , and underestimating at the same time the effect it has on the taliban .
i do n't think petraeus has a serious interest in a settlement that sees the taliban as a part of afghan society .
was the strategy of petraeus ' predecessor more promising ? compared to petraeus , mcchrystal seemed like he understood things far better and had a better appreciation of the effects of us military actions .
you can see it in the number of night raids .
when you look at the isaf statistics , about the day after petraeus arrived there was a massive spike in night raids .
petraeus has also restarted the air war .
in november , compared to the last year , three times as many bombs were dropped on afghanistan . to what extent is the western and afghan military strategy hurting the taliban ?
how do they react ? the night raids certainly have an effect .
they catch or kill a lot of them .
but it does n't seem to have either irrevocably damaged their morale or their ability to carry out attacks .
there does n't seem to be a change in the number of assassinations in the city .
it is tough for the taliban , but they will come back in spring and start all over again . some argue that the taliban are about to change and possibly get more radical as a result of the war .
do you agree ? you can see it in terms of their tactics in the number of beheadings .
that would not have happened before .
it is the same in terms of their attitude to authority , killing elders for example , and also talking back to quetta , the senior leadership , in not being completely subservient to them .
you see it in the general fragmentation also : the taliban shadow governor in kandahar city does n't have control over all taliban groups any more .
a lot of civilian killings in the city are n't ordered from quetta . they often comes from small groups .
some may be pushed by pakistan .
but you have a lot more voices now than before .
what does that mean for the months ahead ? the worry , of course , is that all of these things may eventually lead to a sort of taliban that will look more to an international ' jihad ' with younger people in charge on the side of the insurgency , who have only lived in conflict and war , and who do n't even remember the old afghanistan , or the meaning of peace , from before the soviet war .

" in order for european people to love europe they have to know europe ! "
abad explains .
and in order for european parliamentarians to tweet , they have to know twitter . so abad , who already communicates regularly in 140-character messages , set up a series of educational seminars for his fellow parliamentarians and their staffs to show how and why to use the new social technologies . he thinks it will catch on , but acknowledges , " it 's necessary for us to find the most active meps in order to create a buzz . "
most meps have never heard of twitter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy buzek calls social networking an " opportunity we need to seize . "

only about third to a half of members have a twitter account . a survey a year ago showed that 62 percent of parliamentarians had never even heard of twitter or had never used it and did n't intend to .
jerzy buzek , the parliamentary president and polish represntative has set a good example , opening his own twitter account at the beginning of this year . at age 60 , buzek proves it 's not just a technology for the young gadget-crazy crowd . he warmly addressed the first social-media training session , encouraging participation .
" web 2.0 constitutes for us politicians an opportunity we need to seize , " he said in a pre-recorded video message , shown at one of the workshops held earlier this month in brussels .
" with facebook , twitter and other 2.0 tools , we can get reach out to our citizens on a daily , almost personal basis .
i see it every day through my facebook and twitter accounts . "
the keynote lecturer at that same workshop day was vincent ducrey , a well-known online consultant , who advises the french government on its social media policies and has written a book called the " guide of influence . "
ducrey has worked out meticulous models of the 24-hour news cycle and precisely how to use it for maximum messaging effect .
he said technophobe meps should just get over it , for everybody 's sake , not least their own .
" it 's not about a special party , it 's about democracy , " ducrey insists .
" if we want a high level of participation a high level of voters in three years , they need to start to interact , to raise the question of europe as soon as possible .

and in order for european parliamentarians to tweet , they have to know twitter . so abad , who already communicates regularly in 140-character messages , set up a series of educational seminars for his fellow parliamentarians and their staffs to show how and why to use the new social technologies . he thinks it will catch on , but acknowledges , " it 's necessary for us to find the most active meps in order to create a buzz . "
most meps have never heard of twitter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy buzek calls social networking an " opportunity we need to seize . "
but abad 's got an uphill climb .
only about third to a half of members have a twitter account . a survey a year ago showed that 62 percent of parliamentarians had never even heard of twitter or had never used it and did n't intend to .
jerzy buzek , the parliamentary president and polish represntative has set a good example , opening his own twitter account at the beginning of this year . at age 60 , buzek proves it 's not just a technology for the young gadget-crazy crowd . he warmly addressed the first social-media training session , encouraging participation .
" web 2.0 constitutes for us politicians an opportunity we need to seize , " he said in a pre-recorded video message , shown at one of the workshops held earlier this month in brussels .
" with facebook , twitter and other 2.0 tools , we can get reach out to our citizens on a daily , almost personal basis .
i see it every day through my facebook and twitter accounts . "
the keynote lecturer at that same workshop day was vincent ducrey , a well-known online consultant , who advises the french government on its social media policies and has written a book called the " guide of influence . "
ducrey has worked out meticulous models of the 24-hour news cycle and precisely how to use it for maximum messaging effect .
he said technophobe meps should just get over it , for everybody 's sake , not least their own .
" it 's not about a special party , it 's about democracy , " ducrey insists .
" if we want a high level of participation a high level of voters in three years , they need to start to interact , to raise the question of europe as soon as possible .
and twitter is a good way to do it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 62 percent of meps have never heard of twitter connecting person-to-person ducrey says politicians should learn to be tactical but also personable , and should never have an assistant writing their tweets .

she says with a miniscule campaign budget in 2009 , virtually all the outreach in her campaign was , well , virtual .

advocates hope that the increased use of social networking will get younger europeans interested in what happens in brussels . public apathy is always a big problem for communicators in european union institutions . fewer than half of eligible voters turned out for ep elections in 2009 , continuing a decline that started 30 years ago . but there 's a new breed of european politicians who are tackling the problem of a public disconnect one keystroke at a time .
one of them is damien abad , a 30-year-old member of the european parliament , or mep .
the man from southeastern france says it 's time eu politicians stop just lamenting the lack of interest from constituents and do something about it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european members of parliament are slowly learning how to use facebook so , his idea is to teach his fellow meps what has come all too naturally for people of his generation - using social networking sites like facebook , flickr and twitter as a way to share a personal and informal view of the otherwise obscure european institutions .
" in order for european people to love europe they have to know europe ! "
abad explains .
and in order for european parliamentarians to tweet , they have to know twitter . so abad , who already communicates regularly in 140-character messages , set up a series of educational seminars for his fellow parliamentarians and their staffs to show how and why to use the new social technologies . he thinks it will catch on , but acknowledges , " it 's necessary for us to find the most active meps in order to create a buzz .

but ngo human rights watch is reporting a new wave of forced recruitment . twenty-one-year-old big is banging on his drums on the outskirts of bukavu , the capital of south kivu province in the eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
big was not always such a talented percussionist .
just five years ago he was handling guns , not drumsticks . big was 12 when he joined an armed group in bukavu . he had just witnessed his brother being killed , and the prospect of revenge and money made joining up seem like a good option .
" i saw other children earning money with the army , so i decided to join , " big said .
" physically , they did n't treat me badly because they wanted me to be a healthy member of the group .
but mentally they were not good to me , they gave me bad ideas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thousand young people have been recruited since september , says human rights watch it 's a choice big now wants to put behind him , and one that many children involved in armed groups - whether as soldiers , servants or sex slaves - never made in the first place .
during the second congo war between 1998 and 2003 , thousands of children voluntarily joined armed groups , or were conscripted or born into them .
although the drc is no longer officially at war , the country remains highly militarized as competition over resources , ethnic disputes and political ideologies sustain conflict . now , a report from non-government organization human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- suggests the number of children being forcibly recruited is again on the rise .
' a thousand boys in four months ' human rights watch researchers found that at least a thousand young men and boys have been forcibly recruited and trained for combat since september .
at least 261 of them were under the age of 18 , says karina tercsakean , a senior researcher with human rights watch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drc government has tried to clamp down on child recruitment , but little has changed " the real number is probably even higher , " she told deutsche welle .
" we 've seen an increase in tensions in eastern drc late this year .
some rebel groups have nominally been integrated into the army , but they maintain their separate structures , so they look to expand their ranks . "
she added that rebel groups fighting the army also appear to be recruiting new child soldiers .
young men are abducted from their homes , or they disappear after officers have paid schools or football pitches a visit , says tercsakean .
some boys are promised money or other benefits .
" what is especially worrying is that some of the young men were demobilized in the past , and now they 're re-recruited , " tercsakean said .
human rights watch is calling on the drc government to step up efforts to stamp out such recruitment .
although the practice contravenes local and international law , perpetrators often go unpunished .
breaking the cycle one group that has been involved in demobilizing children is the association de soutien de l 'opprime -lrb- association for the support of oppressed persons , or aso -rrb- , the drumming and theater group now helping rehabilitate big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after they 've been demobilized , many young boys get re-recruited originally , the group was made up of former child soldiers but has expanded over the years to include other marginalized young people : children who have been raped , accused of witchcraft , or simply abandoned .
" when i started psychosocial activities , we found that the cultural activities such as music and theatre could help the youth start over , " said aso coordinator juvenal muderhwa .
" they forget what they lived and rediscover their culture that was missing . "
often children who have fought with armed groups , been raped or accused of witchcraft are shunned by their family and community .
they are left to fend for themselves and overcome their traumatic past alone , which can make recovery all but impossible .

" when people feel supported by their community , when they feel that they are loved and that others understand what happened to them and that it was not their fault that will help them a lot . "
many of the children working with aso , including big , now participate in performances designed to tackle stigma and to discourage other children from considering joining armed groups .
" my goal is to change the ideas of young people like me , " big said .
" i also would like -lsb- the communities we visit -rsb- to see that they too can change and develop , just like i did , through art . "

" i saw other children earning money with the army , so i decided to join , " big said .
" physically , they did n't treat me badly because they wanted me to be a healthy member of the group .
but mentally they were not good to me , they gave me bad ideas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thousand young people have been recruited since september , says human rights watch it 's a choice big now wants to put behind him , and one that many children involved in armed groups - whether as soldiers , servants or sex slaves - never made in the first place .
during the second congo war between 1998 and 2003 , thousands of children voluntarily joined armed groups , or were conscripted or born into them .
although the drc is no longer officially at war , the country remains highly militarized as competition over resources , ethnic disputes and political ideologies sustain conflict . now , a report from non-government organization human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- suggests the number of children being forcibly recruited is again on the rise .
' a thousand boys in four months ' human rights watch researchers found that at least a thousand young men and boys have been forcibly recruited and trained for combat since september .
at least 261 of them were under the age of 18 , says karina tercsakean , a senior researcher with human rights watch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drc government has tried to clamp down on child recruitment , but little has changed " the real number is probably even higher , " she told deutsche welle .
" we 've seen an increase in tensions in eastern drc late this year .
some rebel groups have nominally been integrated into the army , but they maintain their separate structures , so they look to expand their ranks . "
she added that rebel groups fighting the army also appear to be recruiting new child soldiers .
young men are abducted from their homes , or they disappear after officers have paid schools or football pitches a visit , says tercsakean .
some boys are promised money or other benefits .
" what is especially worrying is that some of the young men were demobilized in the past , and now they 're re-recruited , " tercsakean said .
human rights watch is calling on the drc government to step up efforts to stamp out such recruitment .
although the practice contravenes local and international law , perpetrators often go unpunished .
breaking the cycle one group that has been involved in demobilizing children is the association de soutien de l 'opprime -lrb- association for the support of oppressed persons , or aso -rrb- , the drumming and theater group now helping rehabilitate big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after they 've been demobilized , many young boys get re-recruited originally , the group was made up of former child soldiers but has expanded over the years to include other marginalized young people : children who have been raped , accused of witchcraft , or simply abandoned .
" when i started psychosocial activities , we found that the cultural activities such as music and theatre could help the youth start over , " said aso coordinator juvenal muderhwa .
" they forget what they lived and rediscover their culture that was missing . "
often children who have fought with armed groups , been raped or accused of witchcraft are shunned by their family and community .
they are left to fend for themselves and overcome their traumatic past alone , which can make recovery all but impossible .
drumming up support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumming can help overcome trauma " an important factor of overcoming a traumatic event is falling back on one 's social network , " said anna maedl , a clinical psychologist from the university of konstanz , in germany .
" when people feel supported by their community , when they feel that they are loved and that others understand what happened to them and that it was not their fault that will help them a lot . "
many of the children working with aso , including big , now participate in performances designed to tackle stigma and to discourage other children from considering joining armed groups .
" my goal is to change the ideas of young people like me , " big said .
" i also would like -lsb- the communities we visit -rsb- to see that they too can change and develop , just like i did , through art . "

but many observers on the ground say that not much has changed for the better . the dutch researcher and afghanistan expert alex strick van linschoten is one of the few westerners who live in kandahar . he is the co-editor of ' my life with the taliban , ' a book about mullah abdul salam zaeef , the taliban ’ s ambassador to pakistan in 2001 .
he 's currently working on a study on the links between the taliban and al-qaeda , which will be published in conjunction with the center on international cooperation , new york university . deutsche welle : the us troop surge has been visible in the south of afghanistan since the spring of 2010 .
what effect has it had so far on kandahar ? alex strick van linschoten : in some ways , nothing has changed .
there have been foreign troops in and outside kandahar city for several years .
but there are some cosmetic shifts .
you have a lot of traffic jams in the city now .
before , there used to be mainly canadian troops in kandahar , and they would drive around the city so that they would n't cause traffic jams .
this helped to protect them -lrb- as well as locals in the area -rrb- from being hit by ieds -lrb- improvised explosive devices -rrb- .
but now the americans drive straight through the city .
so when an ied goes off , people blame the americans for driving through .
they do n't blame the taliban for placing the bomb .
you also have much more air traffic compared to the last year .
what is the population 's reaction to the conflict ? there are all sorts of things that resonate badly with the people .
i spoke to a cameraman who was embedded with the us troops in arghandab district for a documentary .
he mentioned the case of a us commander who went to a village telling the elders , " you have to show us where all the ieds and mines are , in and around your village .
if not , i 'm going to bombard your village . "
the elders said , " we do n't know where they are . " the local population feels reminded of the soviet times , when there was a concept of collective responsibility as well - something actually forbidden by the 1949 geneva convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war .
how would you describe the situation in kandahar ? people are depressed .
the younger ones are trying to leave .
just a few days ago , two deputy directors of departments were assassinated .
anyone who works for the government is being threatened .
the taliban now have a commission in the city calling on people to leave their jobs .
they know exactly who is doing what .
there is no way that the afghan government or the americans can protect all the people .
the military certainly ca n't pay enough for civilians to risk their lives for a government that no one really believes is going to survive in the present form .
how do the taliban operate in town ? they have a mediation commission .
when you get a ' night letter ' , for example from the taliban , warning the locals not to work with what the taliban call the occupiers , you can object to this letter , arguing that you have n't done anything wrong .
it is their own ' hearts and minds ' campaign .
on the other hand , i do n't see too much of the ideological side in kandahar .
yes , islam is a motivating factor for the insurgency , but i never really found that islam was the main motivating factor for the taliban in the south .
there are many other factors that people think of and talk about before islam .
the us military and government say that they have gained ' momentum ' and that they see progress ... my sense is that general petraeus thinks that he can win the war militarily .
i think he may be overestimating his ability to achieve this goal , and underestimating at the same time the effect it has on the taliban .
i do n't think petraeus has a serious interest in a settlement that sees the taliban as a part of afghan society .
was the strategy of petraeus ' predecessor more promising ? compared to petraeus , mcchrystal seemed like he understood things far better and had a better appreciation of the effects of us military actions .
you can see it in the number of night raids .
when you look at the isaf statistics , about the day after petraeus arrived there was a massive spike in night raids .
petraeus has also restarted the air war .
in november , compared to the last year , three times as many bombs were dropped on afghanistan . to what extent is the western and afghan military strategy hurting the taliban ?
how do they react ? the night raids certainly have an effect .
they catch or kill a lot of them .
but it does n't seem to have either irrevocably damaged their morale or their ability to carry out attacks .
there does n't seem to be a change in the number of assassinations in the city .
it is tough for the taliban , but they will come back in spring and start all over again . some argue that the taliban are about to change and possibly get more radical as a result of the war .
do you agree ? you can see it in terms of their tactics in the number of beheadings .
that would not have happened before .
it is the same in terms of their attitude to authority , killing elders for example , and also talking back to quetta , the senior leadership , in not being completely subservient to them .
you see it in the general fragmentation also : the taliban shadow governor in kandahar city does n't have control over all taliban groups any more .
a lot of civilian killings in the city are n't ordered from quetta . they often comes from small groups .
some may be pushed by pakistan .
but you have a lot more voices now than before .
what does that mean for the months ahead ? the worry , of course , is that all of these things may eventually lead to a sort of taliban that will look more to an international ' jihad ' with younger people in charge on the side of the insurgency , who have only lived in conflict and war , and who do n't even remember the old afghanistan , or the meaning of peace , from before the soviet war .

the un 's ban ki-moon says peacekeepers there will not stand down from their mission and warned against attacks on un troops . the united nations and the european union are increasing the pressure on laurent gbagbo , who is clinging to power despite clear indications that he lost last month 's presidential poll to alassane quattara , who has been recognized as the winner by the international community .
on monday , the eu imposed a visa ban on gbagbo and 18 other high-ranking officials .
an assets freeze could also come into effect later this week . the us and canada have also threatened to impose sanctions . earlier , un secretary-general ban ki-moon rejected a demand from the contested ivory coast government that un peacekeepers leave the country .
former colonial power france also confirmed that its forces would stay . nations ' human rights chief said sunday that more than 50 people have been killed and " massive violations of human rights " have taken place in ivory coast since thursday . navi pillay , the un high commissioner for human rights , said the un had received reports of hundreds of people being abducted by military and militia members close to laurant gbagbo , some of whom were later found dead . one of gbagbo 's military leaders urged young people to prepare for combat with the un and french peacekeepers .
but ban warned troops loyal to gbagbo not to consider attacking international peacekeepers . " there will be consequences for those who have perpetrated or orchestrated any such actions or do so in the future , " ban said in a statement regarding attacks on troop stationed with the un mission . ban also said he was " deeply concerned " by recent attacks on un patrols , blaming " security forces apparently loyal to mr. gbagbo . " the un has offered details of two attacks in two days on its troops and military observers , with two employees sustaining injuries in the altercations . " we 're going to continue our patrols but we 're not seeking confrontation , " unoci spokesperson hamadoun toure said sunday .
" there are sensitive areas where we do n't go , near the presidency .
we 're increasing our vigilance , and we 're ready for anything . " parallel governments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gbagbo -lrb- l . -rrb- and ouattara both claim they won the presidency roughly 10,000 un troops are stationed in the country , along with a further 900 from france .
among other tasks , the troops are protecting the capital abidjan 's golf hotel , where opposition presidential candidate ouattara has assembled his own cabinet and is trying to run an alternative government . the united nations , european union , african union and the ivory coast 's election commission all recognize ouattara as the winner of november 's runoff presidential ballot . nevertheless , gbagbo is clinging to his position , supported by a separate national election body , arguing that he won the vote on a technicality .
as incumbent , gbagbo was able to successfully retain the loyalty of the official armed forces and to keep his hold on most government institutions , while ouattara and his supporters have little more than international support . " the international community has spoken with one voice regarding mr. gbagbo 's attempt to hold on to power , " ban said in his statement , indicating a recent pledge of support for ouattara from the west african economic union , ecowas . the election was supposed to be another step on the road to stability for the poor , war-torn country , which was once the engine room of the west african economy . sporadic outbreaks of violence in abidjan have been met with severe military crackdowns , but the situation is largely calm at present .
the un has said it would try to protect civilians in the capital , as well as ouattara 's makeshift headquarters , should the need arise . ban said the un security council planned to meet monday to discuss the situation in ivory coast and review the mandate of the un mission , which will expire on december 31 . author : mark hallam , martin kuebler , rob mudge -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but silent night – a song known the world over – has very humble origins . silent night 's roots can be traced back to the tiny village of oberndorf in the state of salzburg , austria .
it was written by priest , father joseph mohr , and in its original german form was called , " stille nacht , heilige nacht " , literally , " silent night , holy night . "
mohr 's lyrics were then set to music by schoolteacher franz xaver gruber and the song was first performed in the church of st. nicholas in oberndorf , austria during the christmas service of december 24th 1818 .
unlike the dreamy lullaby we know today , in its original incarnation it was an up-tempo dance tune .
all is calm , all is bright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silent night 's composers : father joseph mohr and franz xaver gruber as mohr 's written reminiscences make no mention of a source of inspiration for the song , its imagined origins have spawned a number of urban myths over the years .
one story has it that the organ in the church of st. nicholas was broken and so a new song had to be hastily written for a different instrument .
another , and perhaps more likely explanation , suggests that mohr simply wanted a new christmas song he could play on his guitar .
the song was translated into english in 1859 by john freeman young , second bishop for the episcopal diocese of florida , and quickly became a popular christmas standard both in religious services and with door-to-door carol singers .
during the 1914 world war i christmas truce , silent night was sung simultaneously by servicemen in english , french and german ; the only song soldiers on both sides of the front line had in common .
sleep in heavenly peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with tourists : the silent night memorial chapel in oberndorf over the decades the song has steadily gained popularity , and has been recorded time and again by pop artists such as the temptations , mahalia jackson and elvis presley .
they each added their own personal touches to the carol , and mahalia jackson ’ s lazy , blues-influenced version even holds the rather unusual honor of being one of the best-selling singles of all time … in norway .
since its first performance on that chilly christmas eve in 1818 , silent night has since been translated into 44 languages and remains , to this day , one of the world ’ s best known and beloved carols .

they 're not very good .
others combine poor performances with delusions of grandeur and animosity toward the world .
deutsche welle identifies the worst offenders . in goal many players pitch a hissy fit if they get benched , but ex-cologne keeper faryd mondragon took his tantrum to a previously unknown biblical level .
having been relieved of his starting role for poor performances and absence due to international duties , the colombian refused to play at all , and then held a press conference comparing his martyrdom to that of jesus .
cologne are apparently non-believers , shipping the malcontent messiah to philadelphia union in the mls .
cologne fans will be happy that faryd is mondra-gone .
the back line among the poor defenders , one particularly stands out .
germany 's leading football magazine , kicker , has ranked bremen 's mikael silvestre the worst player in the entire league , and he was a consensus choice for that distinction among the deutsche welle sport brain-trust as well .
the frenchman tries hard , but is clearly past his prime and was one major reason for bremen 's sputtering start .
bildunterschrift : silvestre ca n't keep up with the league 's youngsters paired with him in our porous central defense is gladbach 's anderson .
the 22-year-old brazilian was a major signing for the foals this summer , but he has " led " his new club to a truly laughable record of 47 goals conceded .
as dw sports writer nick amies succinctly put it ... " atrocious . "
on the flailing flanks , we have hamburg 's guy demel .
once a mainstay in northern germany , the ivorian has become , in the words of dw sports editor matt hermann , " a walking lapse in concentration . "
and not only has hamburg coach armin veh removed him from the starting line-up .
he did n't even make the bench in his club 's last match of the year .
joining him is bremen 's petri pasanen .
hamburg 's arch-rivals have always conceded lots of goals for a top side , but this year , the problem is worse than ever .
bremen 's goal difference is a lousy -12 .
opponents encounter little resistance on the wings , and the finnish veteran has simply not been up to the job .
the problem for bremen is that no one else has been , either .
the midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weather in germany has n't suited camoranesi , r among the candidates put forward for the middle of the pitch were bremen 's marko arnautovic and bayern 's franck ribery , but injuries have somewhat mitigated their poor production .
still , our mediocre midfield features some big names .
stuttgart 's mauro camaronesi has had a lot of highlights in his career , including winning the italian league title and the world cup .
but he 'll want to forget his time at stuttgart thus far .
brought in to great hoopla in the summer , he ca n't even make the starting line-up of a team that 's wintering in the drop zone .
matt put forward wolfsburg 's josue , a former team captain relegated to the bench , but dw sports writer jefferson chase overruled him in favor of the wolves ' diego .
when you pay some 18 million euros for a star with a history of excellence in the bundesliga , you expect more than a handful of goals with the odd assist thrown in .
the brazilian is also hot-headed and is very lucky not to have gotten sent off this season .
value for money is something else .
another playmaker who 's not making the grade is gladbach 's juan arango .
two goals , three assists and one very foolish red card that cost the foals a chance to get much needed points against hoffenheim are the venezuelan 's sad balance sheet .
as nick succinctly put it ... " atrocious . "
and lest anyone think we 're picking on foreigners , completing our flailing foursome is bremen 's aaron hunt .
the german youngster was charged with replacing mesut oezil this season , and he simply has n't been able to .
this may not be entirely his fault , as he was originally a wing striker and some problems adjusting to a new role could have been expected .
but one thing is already clear : a playmaker , he is not .
the forwards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobadilla may love gladbach , but he has n't done them any favors as everyone knows , strikers run hot and cold , so one player scoring more or less than another is often just a reflection of luck and form , and not a fundamental difference in quality .
in order to make the dw sports worst eleven , a forward had to do more than just not score .
he had to kick up a stink in the process .
for that reason , schalke 's edu gets a free pass , despite being nominated by matt .
ciprian marica , who earned a three-match ban late on , when stuttgart really needed him , attracted jefferson 's ire and almost earned a spot in the hall of shame .
but he still came up short .
that 's because matt made a persuasive argument for hamburg 's paolo guerrero , calling him " among the most delusionally self-important players in the league . "
rarely have fans been treated to so much pouting and gesticulating from a player who has a grand total of two goals to his credit after 17 games .
hamburg had great hopes for the peruvian when they brought him from bayern in 2006 - three-and-a-half years on there 's little doubt that he 's not going to fulfill them .
but even guerrero could n't top the histrionics of gladbach 's raul bobadilla .
apparently after taking anger-management lessons from diego maradona , the argentinian went on a rampage in the foals ' match against hanover in early december .
although his team were leading , bobadilla was so incensed in the first half that he lashed out physically at an opponent and verbally at an official , earning himself a straight red .
gladbach went on to lose the match , and bobilla has been suspended indefinitely .
not what your team needs in the struggle against the drop .
or as nick succinctly put it ... " just plain atrocious . "

the midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weather in germany has n't suited camoranesi , r among the candidates put forward for the middle of the pitch were bremen 's marko arnautovic and bayern 's franck ribery , but injuries have somewhat mitigated their poor production .
still , our mediocre midfield features some big names .
stuttgart 's mauro camaronesi has had a lot of highlights in his career , including winning the italian league title and the world cup .
but he 'll want to forget his time at stuttgart thus far .
brought in to great hoopla in the summer , he ca n't even make the starting line-up of a team that 's wintering in the drop zone .
matt put forward wolfsburg 's josue , a former team captain relegated to the bench , but dw sports writer jefferson chase overruled him in favor of the wolves ' diego .
when you pay some 18 million euros for a star with a history of excellence in the bundesliga , you expect more than a handful of goals with the odd assist thrown in .
the brazilian is also hot-headed and is very lucky not to have gotten sent off this season .
value for money is something else .
another playmaker who 's not making the grade is gladbach 's juan arango .
two goals , three assists and one very foolish red card that cost the foals a chance to get much needed points against hoffenheim are the venezuelan 's sad balance sheet .
as nick succinctly put it ... " atrocious . "
and lest anyone think we 're picking on foreigners , completing our flailing foursome is bremen 's aaron hunt .
the german youngster was charged with replacing mesut oezil this season , and he simply has n't been able to .
this may not be entirely his fault , as he was originally a wing striker and some problems adjusting to a new role could have been expected .
but one thing is already clear : a playmaker , he is not .
the forwards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobadilla may love gladbach , but he has n't done them any favors as everyone knows , strikers run hot and cold , so one player scoring more or less than another is often just a reflection of luck and form , and not a fundamental difference in quality .
in order to make the dw sports worst eleven , a forward had to do more than just not score .
he had to kick up a stink in the process .
for that reason , schalke 's edu gets a free pass , despite being nominated by matt .
ciprian marica , who earned a three-match ban late on , when stuttgart really needed him , attracted jefferson 's ire and almost earned a spot in the hall of shame .
but he still came up short .
that 's because matt made a persuasive argument for hamburg 's paolo guerrero , calling him " among the most delusionally self-important players in the league . "
rarely have fans been treated to so much pouting and gesticulating from a player who has a grand total of two goals to his credit after 17 games .
hamburg had great hopes for the peruvian when they brought him from bayern in 2006 - three-and-a-half years on there 's little doubt that he 's not going to fulfill them .
but even guerrero could n't top the histrionics of gladbach 's raul bobadilla .
apparently after taking anger-management lessons from diego maradona , the argentinian went on a rampage in the foals ' match against hanover in early december .
although his team were leading , bobadilla was so incensed in the first half that he lashed out physically at an opponent and verbally at an official , earning himself a straight red .
gladbach went on to lose the match , and bobilla has been suspended indefinitely .
not what your team needs in the struggle against the drop .
or as nick succinctly put it ... " just plain atrocious . "

but many observers on the ground say that not much has changed for the better . the dutch researcher and afghanistan expert alex strick van linschoten is one of the few westerners who live in kandahar . he is the co-editor of ' my life with the taliban , ' a book about mullah abdul salam zaeef , the taliban ’ s ambassador to pakistan in 2001 .
he 's currently working on a study on the links between the taliban and al-qaeda , which will be published in conjunction with the center on international cooperation , new york university . deutsche welle : the us troop surge has been visible in the south of afghanistan since the spring of 2010 .
what effect has it had so far on kandahar ? alex strick van linschoten : in some ways , nothing has changed .
there have been foreign troops in and outside kandahar city for several years .
but there are some cosmetic shifts .
you have a lot of traffic jams in the city now .
before , there used to be mainly canadian troops in kandahar , and they would drive around the city so that they would n't cause traffic jams .
this helped to protect them -lrb- as well as locals in the area -rrb- from being hit by ieds -lrb- improvised explosive devices -rrb- .
but now the americans drive straight through the city .
so when an ied goes off , people blame the americans for driving through .
they do n't blame the taliban for placing the bomb .
you also have much more air traffic compared to the last year .
what is the population 's reaction to the conflict ? there are all sorts of things that resonate badly with the people .
i spoke to a cameraman who was embedded with the us troops in arghandab district for a documentary .
he mentioned the case of a us commander who went to a village telling the elders , " you have to show us where all the ieds and mines are , in and around your village .
if not , i 'm going to bombard your village . "
the elders said , " we do n't know where they are . " the local population feels reminded of the soviet times , when there was a concept of collective responsibility as well - something actually forbidden by the 1949 geneva convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war .
how would you describe the situation in kandahar ? people are depressed .
the younger ones are trying to leave .
just a few days ago , two deputy directors of departments were assassinated .
anyone who works for the government is being threatened .
the taliban now have a commission in the city calling on people to leave their jobs .
they know exactly who is doing what .
there is no way that the afghan government or the americans can protect all the people .
the military certainly ca n't pay enough for civilians to risk their lives for a government that no one really believes is going to survive in the present form .
how do the taliban operate in town ? they have a mediation commission .
when you get a ' night letter ' , for example from the taliban , warning the locals not to work with what the taliban call the occupiers , you can object to this letter , arguing that you have n't done anything wrong .
it is their own ' hearts and minds ' campaign .
on the other hand , i do n't see too much of the ideological side in kandahar .
yes , islam is a motivating factor for the insurgency , but i never really found that islam was the main motivating factor for the taliban in the south .
there are many other factors that people think of and talk about before islam .
the us military and government say that they have gained ' momentum ' and that they see progress ... my sense is that general petraeus thinks that he can win the war militarily .
i think he may be overestimating his ability to achieve this goal , and underestimating at the same time the effect it has on the taliban .
i do n't think petraeus has a serious interest in a settlement that sees the taliban as a part of afghan society .
was the strategy of petraeus ' predecessor more promising ? compared to petraeus , mcchrystal seemed like he understood things far better and had a better appreciation of the effects of us military actions .
you can see it in the number of night raids .
when you look at the isaf statistics , about the day after petraeus arrived there was a massive spike in night raids .
petraeus has also restarted the air war .
in november , compared to the last year , three times as many bombs were dropped on afghanistan . to what extent is the western and afghan military strategy hurting the taliban ?
how do they react ? the night raids certainly have an effect .
they catch or kill a lot of them .
but it does n't seem to have either irrevocably damaged their morale or their ability to carry out attacks .
there does n't seem to be a change in the number of assassinations in the city .
it is tough for the taliban , but they will come back in spring and start all over again . some argue that the taliban are about to change and possibly get more radical as a result of the war .
do you agree ? you can see it in terms of their tactics in the number of beheadings .
that would not have happened before .
it is the same in terms of their attitude to authority , killing elders for example , and also talking back to quetta , the senior leadership , in not being completely subservient to them .
you see it in the general fragmentation also : the taliban shadow governor in kandahar city does n't have control over all taliban groups any more .
a lot of civilian killings in the city are n't ordered from quetta . they often comes from small groups .
some may be pushed by pakistan .
but you have a lot more voices now than before .
what does that mean for the months ahead ? the worry , of course , is that all of these things may eventually lead to a sort of taliban that will look more to an international ' jihad ' with younger people in charge on the side of the insurgency , who have only lived in conflict and war , and who do n't even remember the old afghanistan , or the meaning of peace , from before the soviet war .

germany 's world cup squad took the team prize . every year since 1947 , german sportswriters have cast their ballots on the sunday before christmas for the country 's athletes of the year .
in 2010 , the roughly 1,500 vote-casting journalists nominated two athletes who make their living at break-neck speed for the individual athletes of the year and a certain black and white soccer team who took third place at the world cup in south africa for the team award .
pedal to the metal for much of the year in germany , the biggest headlines to come from the world of formula one racing were about legendary driver michael schumacher 's return to the sport .
but the big news about schumacher was eclipsed at the end of the racing season by sebastian vettel , who won the drivers championship in the last race of the season and became the youngest champion in formula one history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel was welcomed back to germany as a hero for most of 2010 , vettel was in the running for the title and came into the final race in abu dhabi in third place .
but trailing by 15 points to ferrari 's fernando alonso meant winning was a long shot .
in the end though , vettel won the race and alonso finished far enough back that vettel was able to take the title and give german fans a new champion to celebrate .
in baden baden , where the awards ceremony took place , vettel said it was rewarding to be honored with the prize of sportsman of the year .
" the whole year , you 're working so hard , and when you 're rewarded for that at the end - i ca n't even describe how good it feels , " he said at the ceremony .
vettel finished ahead of table tennis player timo boll and germany 's golf sensation , martin kaymer .

maria riesch was one of germany 's top-performing athletes at the winter olympics in vancouver .
she won gold in the slalom and combined events over american lindsey vonn , a close friend and one of her biggest competitors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two golds in vancouver made riesch one of germany 's top performers the alpine skier from garmisch-partenkirchen in southern germany is used to winning by small margins , so it was fitting that she barely edged out magdalena neuner for the sportswoman of the year award .
neuner won two golds and a silver in biathlon competitions in vancouver , but was happy to see riesch receive the honor .
" i thought it was going to be her , " said neuner , " i already won it once -lsb- in 2007 -rsb- , and maria had such great performances this year , so for me it was clear and i 'm not disappointed . "
in the current alpine skiing season , riesch and vonn are nearly neck and neck in the leaders ' standings .
vonn has a three point lead on riesch , but both women are well ahead of the rest of the field .
riesch and vonn will vie for the world title at the alpine skiing world championship in garmisch-partenkirchen in february 2011 .
world cup squad germany 's team from the football world cup in south africa was voted team of the year after taking third place in the competition .
but the votes for the national squad reflected their exciting style of play as much as their high finish in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vuvuzela 's - and germany 's third place - stand out from south africa in baden baden , coach joachim loew and captain philipp lahm were on hand to accept the prize on behalf of the team .
" it 's satisfying when you can still impress people enough later in the year -lsb- to vote for you -rsb- , " said loew .
for the german national soccer team , it is the ninth team of the year award .
the squad beat out germany 's world champion men 's eight rowing team and the national ice hockey team , which took fourth as host nation at the world championship in may .

the un 's ban ki-moon says peacekeepers there will not stand down from their mission and warned against attacks on un troops . the united nations and the european union are increasing the pressure on laurent gbagbo , who is clinging to power despite clear indications that he lost last month 's presidential poll to alassane quattara , who has been recognized as the winner by the international community .
on monday , the eu imposed a visa ban on gbagbo and 18 other high-ranking officials .
an assets freeze could also come into effect later this week . the us and canada have also threatened to impose sanctions . earlier , un secretary-general ban ki-moon rejected a demand from the contested ivory coast government that un peacekeepers leave the country .
former colonial power france also confirmed that its forces would stay . nations ' human rights chief said sunday that more than 50 people have been killed and " massive violations of human rights " have taken place in ivory coast since thursday . navi pillay , the un high commissioner for human rights , said the un had received reports of hundreds of people being abducted by military and militia members close to laurant gbagbo , some of whom were later found dead . one of gbagbo 's military leaders urged young people to prepare for combat with the un and french peacekeepers .
but ban warned troops loyal to gbagbo not to consider attacking international peacekeepers . " there will be consequences for those who have perpetrated or orchestrated any such actions or do so in the future , " ban said in a statement regarding attacks on troop stationed with the un mission . ban also said he was " deeply concerned " by recent attacks on un patrols , blaming " security forces apparently loyal to mr. gbagbo . " the un has offered details of two attacks in two days on its troops and military observers , with two employees sustaining injuries in the altercations . " we 're going to continue our patrols but we 're not seeking confrontation , " unoci spokesperson hamadoun toure said sunday .
" there are sensitive areas where we do n't go , near the presidency .
we 're increasing our vigilance , and we 're ready for anything . " parallel governments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gbagbo -lrb- l . -rrb- and ouattara both claim they won the presidency roughly 10,000 un troops are stationed in the country , along with a further 900 from france .
among other tasks , the troops are protecting the capital abidjan 's golf hotel , where opposition presidential candidate ouattara has assembled his own cabinet and is trying to run an alternative government . the united nations , european union , african union and the ivory coast 's election commission all recognize ouattara as the winner of november 's runoff presidential ballot . nevertheless , gbagbo is clinging to his position , supported by a separate national election body , arguing that he won the vote on a technicality .
as incumbent , gbagbo was able to successfully retain the loyalty of the official armed forces and to keep his hold on most government institutions , while ouattara and his supporters have little more than international support . " the international community has spoken with one voice regarding mr. gbagbo 's attempt to hold on to power , " ban said in his statement , indicating a recent pledge of support for ouattara from the west african economic union , ecowas . the election was supposed to be another step on the road to stability for the poor , war-torn country , which was once the engine room of the west african economy . sporadic outbreaks of violence in abidjan have been met with severe military crackdowns , but the situation is largely calm at present .
the un has said it would try to protect civilians in the capital , as well as ouattara 's makeshift headquarters , should the need arise . ban said the un security council planned to meet monday to discuss the situation in ivory coast and review the mandate of the un mission , which will expire on december 31 . author : mark hallam , martin kuebler , rob mudge -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but silent night – a song known the world over – has very humble origins . silent night 's roots can be traced back to the tiny village of oberndorf in the state of salzburg , austria .
it was written by priest , father joseph mohr , and in its original german form was called , " stille nacht , heilige nacht " , literally , " silent night , holy night . "
mohr 's lyrics were then set to music by schoolteacher franz xaver gruber and the song was first performed in the church of st. nicholas in oberndorf , austria during the christmas service of december 24th 1818 .
unlike the dreamy lullaby we know today , in its original incarnation it was an up-tempo dance tune .
all is calm , all is bright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silent night 's composers : father joseph mohr and franz xaver gruber as mohr 's written reminiscences make no mention of a source of inspiration for the song , its imagined origins have spawned a number of urban myths over the years .
one story has it that the organ in the church of st. nicholas was broken and so a new song had to be hastily written for a different instrument .
another , and perhaps more likely explanation , suggests that mohr simply wanted a new christmas song he could play on his guitar .
the song was translated into english in 1859 by john freeman young , second bishop for the episcopal diocese of florida , and quickly became a popular christmas standard both in religious services and with door-to-door carol singers .
during the 1914 world war i christmas truce , silent night was sung simultaneously by servicemen in english , french and german ; the only song soldiers on both sides of the front line had in common .
sleep in heavenly peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with tourists : the silent night memorial chapel in oberndorf over the decades the song has steadily gained popularity , and has been recorded time and again by pop artists such as the temptations , mahalia jackson and elvis presley .
they each added their own personal touches to the carol , and mahalia jackson ’ s lazy , blues-influenced version even holds the rather unusual honor of being one of the best-selling singles of all time … in norway .
since its first performance on that chilly christmas eve in 1818 , silent night has since been translated into 44 languages and remains , to this day , one of the world ’ s best known and beloved carols .

they 're not very good .
others combine poor performances with delusions of grandeur and animosity toward the world .
deutsche welle identifies the worst offenders . in goal many players pitch a hissy fit if they get benched , but ex-cologne keeper faryd mondragon took his tantrum to a previously unknown biblical level .
having been relieved of his starting role for poor performances and absence due to international duties , the colombian refused to play at all , and then held a press conference comparing his martyrdom to that of jesus .
cologne are apparently non-believers , shipping the malcontent messiah to philadelphia union in the mls .
cologne fans will be happy that faryd is mondra-gone .
the back line among the poor defenders , one particularly stands out .
germany 's leading football magazine , kicker , has ranked bremen 's mikael silvestre the worst player in the entire league , and he was a consensus choice for that distinction among the deutsche welle sport brain-trust as well .
the frenchman tries hard , but is clearly past his prime and was one major reason for bremen 's sputtering start .
bildunterschrift : silvestre ca n't keep up with the league 's youngsters paired with him in our porous central defense is gladbach 's anderson .
the 22-year-old brazilian was a major signing for the foals this summer , but he has " led " his new club to a truly laughable record of 47 goals conceded .
as dw sports writer nick amies succinctly put it ... " atrocious . "
on the flailing flanks , we have hamburg 's guy demel .
once a mainstay in northern germany , the ivorian has become , in the words of dw sports editor matt hermann , " a walking lapse in concentration . "
and not only has hamburg coach armin veh removed him from the starting line-up .
he did n't even make the bench in his club 's last match of the year .
joining him is bremen 's petri pasanen .
hamburg 's arch-rivals have always conceded lots of goals for a top side , but this year , the problem is worse than ever .
bremen 's goal difference is a lousy -12 .
opponents encounter little resistance on the wings , and the finnish veteran has simply not been up to the job .
the problem for bremen is that no one else has been , either .
the midfield bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the weather in germany has n't suited camoranesi , r among the candidates put forward for the middle of the pitch were bremen 's marko arnautovic and bayern 's franck ribery , but injuries have somewhat mitigated their poor production .
still , our mediocre midfield features some big names .
stuttgart 's mauro camaronesi has had a lot of highlights in his career , including winning the italian league title and the world cup .
but he 'll want to forget his time at stuttgart thus far .
brought in to great hoopla in the summer , he ca n't even make the starting line-up of a team that 's wintering in the drop zone .
matt put forward wolfsburg 's josue , a former team captain relegated to the bench , but dw sports writer jefferson chase overruled him in favor of the wolves ' diego .
when you pay some 18 million euros for a star with a history of excellence in the bundesliga , you expect more than a handful of goals with the odd assist thrown in .
the brazilian is also hot-headed and is very lucky not to have gotten sent off this season .
value for money is something else .
another playmaker who 's not making the grade is gladbach 's juan arango .
two goals , three assists and one very foolish red card that cost the foals a chance to get much needed points against hoffenheim are the venezuelan 's sad balance sheet .
as nick succinctly put it ... " atrocious . "
and lest anyone think we 're picking on foreigners , completing our flailing foursome is bremen 's aaron hunt .
the german youngster was charged with replacing mesut oezil this season , and he simply has n't been able to .
this may not be entirely his fault , as he was originally a wing striker and some problems adjusting to a new role could have been expected .
but one thing is already clear : a playmaker , he is not .
the forwards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bobadilla may love gladbach , but he has n't done them any favors as everyone knows , strikers run hot and cold , so one player scoring more or less than another is often just a reflection of luck and form , and not a fundamental difference in quality .
in order to make the dw sports worst eleven , a forward had to do more than just not score .
he had to kick up a stink in the process .
for that reason , schalke 's edu gets a free pass , despite being nominated by matt .
ciprian marica , who earned a three-match ban late on , when stuttgart really needed him , attracted jefferson 's ire and almost earned a spot in the hall of shame .
but he still came up short .
that 's because matt made a persuasive argument for hamburg 's paolo guerrero , calling him " among the most delusionally self-important players in the league . "
rarely have fans been treated to so much pouting and gesticulating from a player who has a grand total of two goals to his credit after 17 games .
hamburg had great hopes for the peruvian when they brought him from bayern in 2006 - three-and-a-half years on there 's little doubt that he 's not going to fulfill them .
but even guerrero could n't top the histrionics of gladbach 's raul bobadilla .
apparently after taking anger-management lessons from diego maradona , the argentinian went on a rampage in the foals ' match against hanover in early december .
although his team were leading , bobadilla was so incensed in the first half that he lashed out physically at an opponent and verbally at an official , earning himself a straight red .
gladbach went on to lose the match , and bobilla has been suspended indefinitely .
not what your team needs in the struggle against the drop .
or as nick succinctly put it ... " just plain atrocious . "

but many observers on the ground say that not much has changed for the better . the dutch researcher and afghanistan expert alex strick van linschoten is one of the few westerners who live in kandahar . he is the co-editor of ' my life with the taliban , ' a book about mullah abdul salam zaeef , the taliban ’ s ambassador to pakistan in 2001 .
he 's currently working on a study on the links between the taliban and al-qaeda , which will be published in conjunction with the center on international cooperation , new york university . deutsche welle : the us troop surge has been visible in the south of afghanistan since the spring of 2010 .
what effect has it had so far on kandahar ? alex strick van linschoten : in some ways , nothing has changed .
there have been foreign troops in and outside kandahar city for several years .
but there are some cosmetic shifts .
you have a lot of traffic jams in the city now .
before , there used to be mainly canadian troops in kandahar , and they would drive around the city so that they would n't cause traffic jams .
this helped to protect them -lrb- as well as locals in the area -rrb- from being hit by ieds -lrb- improvised explosive devices -rrb- .
but now the americans drive straight through the city .
so when an ied goes off , people blame the americans for driving through .
they do n't blame the taliban for placing the bomb .
you also have much more air traffic compared to the last year .
what is the population 's reaction to the conflict ? there are all sorts of things that resonate badly with the people .
i spoke to a cameraman who was embedded with the us troops in arghandab district for a documentary .
he mentioned the case of a us commander who went to a village telling the elders , " you have to show us where all the ieds and mines are , in and around your village .
if not , i 'm going to bombard your village . "
the elders said , " we do n't know where they are . " the local population feels reminded of the soviet times , when there was a concept of collective responsibility as well - something actually forbidden by the 1949 geneva convention relative to the protection of civilian persons in time of war .
how would you describe the situation in kandahar ? people are depressed .
the younger ones are trying to leave .
just a few days ago , two deputy directors of departments were assassinated .
anyone who works for the government is being threatened .
the taliban now have a commission in the city calling on people to leave their jobs .
they know exactly who is doing what .
there is no way that the afghan government or the americans can protect all the people .
the military certainly ca n't pay enough for civilians to risk their lives for a government that no one really believes is going to survive in the present form .
how do the taliban operate in town ? they have a mediation commission .
when you get a ' night letter ' , for example from the taliban , warning the locals not to work with what the taliban call the occupiers , you can object to this letter , arguing that you have n't done anything wrong .
it is their own ' hearts and minds ' campaign .
on the other hand , i do n't see too much of the ideological side in kandahar .
yes , islam is a motivating factor for the insurgency , but i never really found that islam was the main motivating factor for the taliban in the south .
there are many other factors that people think of and talk about before islam .
the us military and government say that they have gained ' momentum ' and that they see progress ... my sense is that general petraeus thinks that he can win the war militarily .
i think he may be overestimating his ability to achieve this goal , and underestimating at the same time the effect it has on the taliban .
i do n't think petraeus has a serious interest in a settlement that sees the taliban as a part of afghan society .
was the strategy of petraeus ' predecessor more promising ? compared to petraeus , mcchrystal seemed like he understood things far better and had a better appreciation of the effects of us military actions .
you can see it in the number of night raids .
when you look at the isaf statistics , about the day after petraeus arrived there was a massive spike in night raids .
petraeus has also restarted the air war .
in november , compared to the last year , three times as many bombs were dropped on afghanistan . to what extent is the western and afghan military strategy hurting the taliban ?
how do they react ? the night raids certainly have an effect .
they catch or kill a lot of them .
but it does n't seem to have either irrevocably damaged their morale or their ability to carry out attacks .
there does n't seem to be a change in the number of assassinations in the city .
it is tough for the taliban , but they will come back in spring and start all over again . some argue that the taliban are about to change and possibly get more radical as a result of the war .
do you agree ? you can see it in terms of their tactics in the number of beheadings .
that would not have happened before .
it is the same in terms of their attitude to authority , killing elders for example , and also talking back to quetta , the senior leadership , in not being completely subservient to them .
you see it in the general fragmentation also : the taliban shadow governor in kandahar city does n't have control over all taliban groups any more .
a lot of civilian killings in the city are n't ordered from quetta . they often comes from small groups .
some may be pushed by pakistan .
but you have a lot more voices now than before .
what does that mean for the months ahead ? the worry , of course , is that all of these things may eventually lead to a sort of taliban that will look more to an international ' jihad ' with younger people in charge on the side of the insurgency , who have only lived in conflict and war , and who do n't even remember the old afghanistan , or the meaning of peace , from before the soviet war .

the statement by the military command , carried on the north korean news agency kcna , continued , " the world should properly know who is the true champion of peace and who is the real provocateur of a war . "
south korea fired dozens of artillery rounds during a live-fire exercise from the island of yeonpyeong on monday .
the island lies near the border with north korea , which has threatened retaliation .
after a similar drill last month , north korean military shelled the island , killing four people .
the united nations security council met for an emergency session on sunday over the growing tensions on the korean peninsula , but was unable to come up with a unanimous response to the crisis .
the majority of the 15 council members have insisted " on a clear-cut condemnation of the november 23 attack " by north korea on south korea in an artillery shelling incident , said susan rice , the us envoy to the united nations .
" there was not unanimity on that point , " she said .
russia and china were instead pushing for an ambiguous statement that would not blame north korea for the crisis , she added .
" it is important that we keep in mind that this tense situation springs from one source and one source alone - the consistently provocative behavior of north korea , " she said .
russia , which had demanded the meeting , said a special un envoy was needed to facilitate talks between north and south korea .
according to a draft statement distributed by russia to the other 14 security council members , it instead called for " maximum restraint " by the two sides .
both koreas have warned they will use military means to defend the disputed border zone on the west coast , raising concerns in the international community that the standoff could rapidly escalate .
military exercises test tensions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia called for restraint from both sides in a statement to the un security council following the shelling of the south korean island of yeonpyeong by the north last month , tensions have spiked between the two neighbors .
the attack on the island killed two civilians and two south korean marines .
the south 's latest plans to conduct live-fire drills on the island were backed by the united states . residents there were told to move into shelters .
north korea warned of " catastrophe " if the south went ahead with the military exercise , saying it would trigger all-out conflict on the peninsula .
the yonhap news agency , quoting a south korean government source , reported that pyongyang had raised an alert for artillery units along the west coast .
council split over whether to assign blame western envoys inside sunday 's eight-hour closed door meeting told the reuters news agency , on condition of anonymity , that council members were split over whether to assign blame for the crisis to north korea .
the us , britain , france and non-permanent member japan supported the idea , with russia and china against the move .
the two holdouts eventually revised their draft statement , condemning last month 's attack which ban has called " one of the gravest incidents since the end of the korean war . "
they did not , however , explicitly blame north korea for the attack . russia 's role the russian draft resolution released sunday sought " a resumption of dialogue and resolution of all problems dividing -lsb- the two sides -rsb- exclusively through peaceful diplomatic means . "
in the resolution , russia calls for un secretary general ban ki-moon to " dispatch without delay " a special representative to seoul and pyongyang .
russia called for the emergency meeting on saturday and expressed some anger that it was only to be convened a day later .
the security council is currently led by the us , and a statement said the meeting was organized for sunday so that countries had time to consult with their governments .
commitment to re-admit inspectors according to the television news channel cnn , a us envoy to north korea , bill richardson , had won agreement to re-admit un nuclear weapons inspectors .
but a spokesman for the us state department , philip crowley , said the government was skeptical that north korea would in fact re-admit the inspectors , who were expelled a year ago .
" north korea talks a great game .
they always do .
the real issue is what will they do , " crowley said . author : martin kuebler , thomas sheldrick , michael lawton -lrb- ap , afp , reuters -rrb- editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 20.12.2010 child soldier recruitment on the rise , says report großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children as young as six are often trained for combat in the eastern democratic republic of congo , a group of former child soldiers are starting to rebuild their lives through drumming and theatre .
but ngo human rights watch is reporting a new wave of forced recruitment . twenty-one-year-old big is banging on his drums on the outskirts of bukavu , the capital of south kivu province in the eastern democratic republic of congo -lrb- drc -rrb- .
big was not always such a talented percussionist .
just five years ago he was handling guns , not drumsticks . big was 12 when he joined an armed group in bukavu . he had just witnessed his brother being killed , and the prospect of revenge and money made joining up seem like a good option .
" i saw other children earning money with the army , so i decided to join , " big said .
" physically , they did n't treat me badly because they wanted me to be a healthy member of the group .
but mentally they were not good to me , they gave me bad ideas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a thousand young people have been recruited since september , says human rights watch it 's a choice big now wants to put behind him , and one that many children involved in armed groups - whether as soldiers , servants or sex slaves - never made in the first place .
during the second congo war between 1998 and 2003 , thousands of children voluntarily joined armed groups , or were conscripted or born into them .
although the drc is no longer officially at war , the country remains highly militarized as competition over resources , ethnic disputes and political ideologies sustain conflict . now , a report from non-government organization human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- suggests the number of children being forcibly recruited is again on the rise .
' a thousand boys in four months ' human rights watch researchers found that at least a thousand young men and boys have been forcibly recruited and trained for combat since september .
at least 261 of them were under the age of 18 , says karina tercsakean , a senior researcher with human rights watch .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the drc government has tried to clamp down on child recruitment , but little has changed " the real number is probably even higher , " she told deutsche welle .
" we 've seen an increase in tensions in eastern drc late this year .
some rebel groups have nominally been integrated into the army , but they maintain their separate structures , so they look to expand their ranks . "
she added that rebel groups fighting the army also appear to be recruiting new child soldiers .
young men are abducted from their homes , or they disappear after officers have paid schools or football pitches a visit , says tercsakean .
some boys are promised money or other benefits .
" what is especially worrying is that some of the young men were demobilized in the past , and now they 're re-recruited , " tercsakean said .
human rights watch is calling on the drc government to step up efforts to stamp out such recruitment .
although the practice contravenes local and international law , perpetrators often go unpunished .
breaking the cycle one group that has been involved in demobilizing children is the association de soutien de l 'opprime -lrb- association for the support of oppressed persons , or aso -rrb- , the drumming and theater group now helping rehabilitate big .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even after they 've been demobilized , many young boys get re-recruited originally , the group was made up of former child soldiers but has expanded over the years to include other marginalized young people : children who have been raped , accused of witchcraft , or simply abandoned .
" when i started psychosocial activities , we found that the cultural activities such as music and theatre could help the youth start over , " said aso coordinator juvenal muderhwa .
" they forget what they lived and rediscover their culture that was missing . "
often children who have fought with armed groups , been raped or accused of witchcraft are shunned by their family and community .
they are left to fend for themselves and overcome their traumatic past alone , which can make recovery all but impossible .
drumming up support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drumming can help overcome trauma " an important factor of overcoming a traumatic event is falling back on one 's social network , " said anna maedl , a clinical psychologist from the university of konstanz , in germany .
" when people feel supported by their community , when they feel that they are loved and that others understand what happened to them and that it was not their fault that will help them a lot . "
many of the children working with aso , including big , now participate in performances designed to tackle stigma and to discourage other children from considering joining armed groups .
" my goal is to change the ideas of young people like me , " big said .
" i also would like -lsb- the communities we visit -rsb- to see that they too can change and develop , just like i did , through art . "

advocates hope that the increased use of social networking will get younger europeans interested in what happens in brussels . public apathy is always a big problem for communicators in european union institutions . fewer than half of eligible voters turned out for ep elections in 2009 , continuing a decline that started 30 years ago . but there 's a new breed of european politicians who are tackling the problem of a public disconnect one keystroke at a time .
one of them is damien abad , a 30-year-old member of the european parliament , or mep .
the man from southeastern france says it 's time eu politicians stop just lamenting the lack of interest from constituents and do something about it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european members of parliament are slowly learning how to use facebook so , his idea is to teach his fellow meps what has come all too naturally for people of his generation - using social networking sites like facebook , flickr and twitter as a way to share a personal and informal view of the otherwise obscure european institutions .
" in order for european people to love europe they have to know europe ! "
abad explains .
and in order for european parliamentarians to tweet , they have to know twitter . so abad , who already communicates regularly in 140-character messages , set up a series of educational seminars for his fellow parliamentarians and their staffs to show how and why to use the new social technologies . he thinks it will catch on , but acknowledges , " it 's necessary for us to find the most active meps in order to create a buzz . "
most meps have never heard of twitter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy buzek calls social networking an " opportunity we need to seize . "
but abad 's got an uphill climb .
only about third to a half of members have a twitter account . a survey a year ago showed that 62 percent of parliamentarians had never even heard of twitter or had never used it and did n't intend to .
jerzy buzek , the parliamentary president and polish represntative has set a good example , opening his own twitter account at the beginning of this year . at age 60 , buzek proves it 's not just a technology for the young gadget-crazy crowd . he warmly addressed the first social-media training session , encouraging participation .
" web 2.0 constitutes for us politicians an opportunity we need to seize , " he said in a pre-recorded video message , shown at one of the workshops held earlier this month in brussels .
" with facebook , twitter and other 2.0 tools , we can get reach out to our citizens on a daily , almost personal basis .
i see it every day through my facebook and twitter accounts . "
the keynote lecturer at that same workshop day was vincent ducrey , a well-known online consultant , who advises the french government on its social media policies and has written a book called the " guide of influence . "
ducrey has worked out meticulous models of the 24-hour news cycle and precisely how to use it for maximum messaging effect .
he said technophobe meps should just get over it , for everybody 's sake , not least their own .
" it 's not about a special party , it 's about democracy , " ducrey insists .
" if we want a high level of participation a high level of voters in three years , they need to start to interact , to raise the question of europe as soon as possible .
and twitter is a good way to do it . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 62 percent of meps have never heard of twitter connecting person-to-person ducrey says politicians should learn to be tactical but also personable , and should never have an assistant writing their tweets .
one of the believers who 's urging her colleagues to hop on board is marietje schaake , a dutch mep who says she would n't be in brussels at all if it were n't for social media .
she says with a miniscule campaign budget in 2009 , virtually all the outreach in her campaign was , well , virtual .
" obviously you have an idea , " she said .
" people believe in the idea and in you as a person but to reach them and to interact with them and to make sure they know about you , it could only happen through the internet . "
there are others who 've been on the same wavelength , so to speak , for some time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : member of the european parliament are generally skeptical of social networking europatweets was a service formed during the 2009 parliamentary elections to distribute information regarding the vote .
it has continued and expanded with its partners into a new service called " tweet your mep " in september . the principle here , said belgian co-creator henri lastenouse , is to provoke conversation , for voters to feel their elected representatives are accountable to them and for the whole world to see if they are not , by looking at the public twitter accounts .
lastenouse predicts public officials will increasingly be forced to take this platform seriously .
they 'll also have to adjust to not being in complete control of what happens , lastenouse says , as they are when they just maintain a website and post items to it .

the un 's ban ki-moon says peacekeepers there will not stand down from their mission and warned against attacks on un troops . the united nations and the european union are increasing the pressure on laurent gbagbo , who is clinging to power despite clear indications that he lost last month 's presidential poll to alassane quattara , who has been recognized as the winner by the international community .
on monday , the eu imposed a visa ban on gbagbo and 18 other high-ranking officials .
an assets freeze could also come into effect later this week . the us and canada have also threatened to impose sanctions . earlier , un secretary-general ban ki-moon rejected a demand from the contested ivory coast government that un peacekeepers leave the country .
former colonial power france also confirmed that its forces would stay . nations ' human rights chief said sunday that more than 50 people have been killed and " massive violations of human rights " have taken place in ivory coast since thursday . navi pillay , the un high commissioner for human rights , said the un had received reports of hundreds of people being abducted by military and militia members close to laurant gbagbo , some of whom were later found dead . one of gbagbo 's military leaders urged young people to prepare for combat with the un and french peacekeepers .
but ban warned troops loyal to gbagbo not to consider attacking international peacekeepers . " there will be consequences for those who have perpetrated or orchestrated any such actions or do so in the future , " ban said in a statement regarding attacks on troop stationed with the un mission . ban also said he was " deeply concerned " by recent attacks on un patrols , blaming " security forces apparently loyal to mr. gbagbo . " the un has offered details of two attacks in two days on its troops and military observers , with two employees sustaining injuries in the altercations . " we 're going to continue our patrols but we 're not seeking confrontation , " unoci spokesperson hamadoun toure said sunday .
" there are sensitive areas where we do n't go , near the presidency .
we 're increasing our vigilance , and we 're ready for anything . " parallel governments bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gbagbo -lrb- l . -rrb- and ouattara both claim they won the presidency roughly 10,000 un troops are stationed in the country , along with a further 900 from france .
among other tasks , the troops are protecting the capital abidjan 's golf hotel , where opposition presidential candidate ouattara has assembled his own cabinet and is trying to run an alternative government . the united nations , european union , african union and the ivory coast 's election commission all recognize ouattara as the winner of november 's runoff presidential ballot . nevertheless , gbagbo is clinging to his position , supported by a separate national election body , arguing that he won the vote on a technicality .
as incumbent , gbagbo was able to successfully retain the loyalty of the official armed forces and to keep his hold on most government institutions , while ouattara and his supporters have little more than international support . " the international community has spoken with one voice regarding mr. gbagbo 's attempt to hold on to power , " ban said in his statement , indicating a recent pledge of support for ouattara from the west african economic union , ecowas . the election was supposed to be another step on the road to stability for the poor , war-torn country , which was once the engine room of the west african economy . sporadic outbreaks of violence in abidjan have been met with severe military crackdowns , but the situation is largely calm at present .
the un has said it would try to protect civilians in the capital , as well as ouattara 's makeshift headquarters , should the need arise . ban said the un security council planned to meet monday to discuss the situation in ivory coast and review the mandate of the un mission , which will expire on december 31 . author : mark hallam , martin kuebler , rob mudge -lrb- afp , dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de christmas -pipe- 20.12.2010 silent night still as popular as ever almost 200 years on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a popular song at church services for almost 200 years it 's been performed and covered countless times and is without doubt one of the world 's best-loved christmas carols .
but silent night – a song known the world over – has very humble origins . silent night 's roots can be traced back to the tiny village of oberndorf in the state of salzburg , austria .
it was written by priest , father joseph mohr , and in its original german form was called , " stille nacht , heilige nacht " , literally , " silent night , holy night . "
mohr 's lyrics were then set to music by schoolteacher franz xaver gruber and the song was first performed in the church of st. nicholas in oberndorf , austria during the christmas service of december 24th 1818 .
unlike the dreamy lullaby we know today , in its original incarnation it was an up-tempo dance tune .
all is calm , all is bright bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silent night 's composers : father joseph mohr and franz xaver gruber as mohr 's written reminiscences make no mention of a source of inspiration for the song , its imagined origins have spawned a number of urban myths over the years .
one story has it that the organ in the church of st. nicholas was broken and so a new song had to be hastily written for a different instrument .
another , and perhaps more likely explanation , suggests that mohr simply wanted a new christmas song he could play on his guitar .
the song was translated into english in 1859 by john freeman young , second bishop for the episcopal diocese of florida , and quickly became a popular christmas standard both in religious services and with door-to-door carol singers .
during the 1914 world war i christmas truce , silent night was sung simultaneously by servicemen in english , french and german ; the only song soldiers on both sides of the front line had in common .
sleep in heavenly peace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular with tourists : the silent night memorial chapel in oberndorf over the decades the song has steadily gained popularity , and has been recorded time and again by pop artists such as the temptations , mahalia jackson and elvis presley .
they each added their own personal touches to the carol , and mahalia jackson ’ s lazy , blues-influenced version even holds the rather unusual honor of being one of the best-selling singles of all time … in norway .
since its first performance on that chilly christmas eve in 1818 , silent night has since been translated into 44 languages and remains , to this day , one of the world ’ s best known and beloved carols .

lord chief justice igor judge said that the use of " unobtrusive , hand held , virtually silent " equipment to give live text updates is unlikely to interfere with the administration of justice .
cameras and recording equipment are barred in british courts , but twitter has been a gray area .
" there is no statutory prohibition on the use of live text-based communications in open court , " the lord chief justice wrote in an interim practice guidance posted to the english judiciary website .
" but before such use is permitted , the court must be satisfied that its use does not pose a danger of interference to the proper administration of justice in the individual case . "

however , a different judge banned the practice after an appeal to a higher court two days later .
priority given to journalists clarifying the confusion england 's and wales ' most senior judicial official , igor judge , said priority would be given to journalists , but in general the use of twitter would be allowed in british courtrooms provided it did n't interfere with court proceedings .
reporting from british courts is tightly controlled , with television coverage and photography prohibited and sound recording allowed only in exceptional circumstances .
assange was freed last week on 200,000 pounds -lrb- 236,000 euros -rrb- bail after three high-profile court appearances .
the judiciary 's final rules will be issued after a consultation process , sometime in the forthcoming months .

germany 's world cup squad took the team prize . every year since 1947 , german sportswriters have cast their ballots on the sunday before christmas for the country 's athletes of the year .
in 2010 , the roughly 1,500 vote-casting journalists nominated two athletes who make their living at break-neck speed for the individual athletes of the year and a certain black and white soccer team who took third place at the world cup in south africa for the team award .
pedal to the metal for much of the year in germany , the biggest headlines to come from the world of formula one racing were about legendary driver michael schumacher 's return to the sport .
but the big news about schumacher was eclipsed at the end of the racing season by sebastian vettel , who won the drivers championship in the last race of the season and became the youngest champion in formula one history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel was welcomed back to germany as a hero for most of 2010 , vettel was in the running for the title and came into the final race in abu dhabi in third place .
but trailing by 15 points to ferrari 's fernando alonso meant winning was a long shot .
in the end though , vettel won the race and alonso finished far enough back that vettel was able to take the title and give german fans a new champion to celebrate .
in baden baden , where the awards ceremony took place , vettel said it was rewarding to be honored with the prize of sportsman of the year .
" the whole year , you 're working so hard , and when you 're rewarded for that at the end - i ca n't even describe how good it feels , " he said at the ceremony .
vettel finished ahead of table tennis player timo boll and germany 's golf sensation , martin kaymer .

she won gold in the slalom and combined events over american lindsey vonn , a close friend and one of her biggest competitors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two golds in vancouver made riesch one of germany 's top performers the alpine skier from garmisch-partenkirchen in southern germany is used to winning by small margins , so it was fitting that she barely edged out magdalena neuner for the sportswoman of the year award .
neuner won two golds and a silver in biathlon competitions in vancouver , but was happy to see riesch receive the honor .
" i thought it was going to be her , " said neuner , " i already won it once -lsb- in 2007 -rsb- , and maria had such great performances this year , so for me it was clear and i 'm not disappointed . "
in the current alpine skiing season , riesch and vonn are nearly neck and neck in the leaders ' standings .
vonn has a three point lead on riesch , but both women are well ahead of the rest of the field .
riesch and vonn will vie for the world title at the alpine skiing world championship in garmisch-partenkirchen in february 2011 .
world cup squad germany 's team from the football world cup in south africa was voted team of the year after taking third place in the competition .
but the votes for the national squad reflected their exciting style of play as much as their high finish in the tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vuvuzela 's - and germany 's third place - stand out from south africa in baden baden , coach joachim loew and captain philipp lahm were on hand to accept the prize on behalf of the team .
" it 's satisfying when you can still impress people enough later in the year -lsb- to vote for you -rsb- , " said loew .
for the german national soccer team , it is the ninth team of the year award .
the squad beat out germany 's world champion men 's eight rowing team and the national ice hockey team , which took fourth as host nation at the world championship in may .

welcoming and hopeful faces manning the christmas stands still hope for customers despite this year 's terror warning , icy rain , and swirling snowstorms .
johanna sievers is one of them .
the young student is working for the first time at a traditional christmas market . her booth sells treats imported from the provence region in southern france , including rich almond studded nougat , caramels and chocolates . the newly opened gourmet shop she 's working for hopes to attract more customers through its booth . terror warning but after a government-issued terror warning was released at the end of november , along with news reports that christmas markets might be targeted , some of sievers ' friends expressed concerns about her job .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sievers is n't letting security concerns get her down “ when i say i 'm working in a christmas market , many say ' oh my god , really ? ' and they are worried .
i 'm worried too , a little bit , ” she admits .
“ well , the world 's a dangerous place , so why not go to a christmas market ?
you can cross the street and get run over .
that 's actually more likely . ”
many christmas markets are trying to calm fears with a visible police presence and non-uniformed security personnel making their rounds to keep everyone happy - and shopping . as a norwegian tourist picks up a tiny bag of chocolate-covered figs , sievers makes sure to point out the price , 5 euros , explaining that people usually balk at paying that amount for the small bag of handcrafted french sweets .
unfazed , the tourist adds it to her order and also tells sievers to keep the change , not common behavior for berliners .
across town in prenzlauer berg 's scandinavian-themed lucia weihnachtsmarkt , bilgec serdaroglu is charming customers with his friendly demeanor and tasty hand-made goods .
a small but steady stream of customers stops at his stand to taste mustards flavored with whiskey , chilli and even licorice .
he also has vinegars and preserves .
most of his wares are priced at an affordable 2.50 euros . bildunterschrift : private security guards maintain a visible presence at berlin 's markets first rain , then snow serdaroglu , who moved to berlin from hamburg , has been selling at the market for six years , but this is the first year he is at the market with his own company .
he 's excited . still , serdaroglu admits people in the city have a tight grip on their wallets .
" berlin is the capital , but the sad part is that it 's the weakest city economically , " he says .
people have difficulties with money , he adds , and going to the christmas market definitely means spending money . " if i take my children to the christmas market , i have to plan on spending an average of 50 euros , " serdaroglu says .
" can i afford it or not ?
that 's the question .
so i can understand when people are holding back a bit . "
open air markets like this one also suffer from the weather .
first came the rain at the end of november , followed by surprising amounts of snow , which cancelled flights and delayed trains , slowing down locals and tourists alike .
and while visitors to berlin 's christmas markets seem to be taking the terror warnings and weather surprises in stride , they are n't all whipping out their cash .
stands selling hot drinks , snacks and affordable gifts are doing well , but some merchants offering jewelry , pottery and other higher priced items gaze out from their unvisited booths looking bored and frustrated . browsing but not buying from a spot next to a wood-burning stove , visitor frank huehn watches the crowd slowly pass by a stand selling felted boots from switzerland .
many people stop to look and warm their hands , but few purchase the shoes , which cost over 100 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lots of browsing but not enough buying at stands , merchants say .
huehn , a merchant himself , is n't selling his own sheepskin goods at this christmas market or any other .
“ the question is n't just how many people come and walk around the market ; vendors are interested in how many are shopping , " he says .
" the market can be very busy , with people exhibiting their wares , and visitors browsing , but they are n't necessarily buying anything . "
the rent at holiday markets , huehn argues , is too high for an unpredictable payoff .
committing for the full run of the season is too risky ; he prefers to try his luck at weekly local markets instead . in the last few years , things have changed for small sellers of handmade goods , partly because of the financial crisis and partly because of a new mindset in germany , according to huehn .
“ in my opinion , a majority of today 's 25 and 30-year-olds just do n't have a sense for quality in products and materials , " he says .
" they do n't work with their hands anymore , so they have no idea - they ca n't judge the quality . they just decide on the price . the older people can tell - they can pick something up in their hands and feel the quality , and they 're ready to pay for it .
the young people ca n't . it 's an unfortunate development . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 20.12.2010 dso members bring their musical expertise to the west bank großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the combined efforts of the dso and the young players culminated in three concerts there are few schools where young musicians in the palestinian west bank can get an education in classical music .
several members of the dso have returned to the region to share their knowledge - and the stage . click below to hear or download pieces from the concerts by the polyphonia ensemble berlin and members of the barenboim-said foundation in ramallah and jerusalem . every now and then , a little squeak slips out , but the three young palestinian clarinet players do n't let it get to them .
they start again and again until the sound is just right .
it 's part of the workshop atmosphere at the barenboim-said foundation 's music academy in the center of ramallah . martin koegel , oboist with the german chamber ensemble polyphonia , is more than happy with his pupils .
he is in ramallah with other members of polyphonia , a subgroup of the deutsches symphonie orchester berlin .
koegel and his fellow musicians were guests of the palestinian music school in the west bank in december 2010 , where young musicians from the region received training side by side by experienced performers from germany .
" for us , it 's about meeting the kids where they are .
we have young people here who began playing just a year ago and others that have five years experience .
with the more experienced players , we work on pieces together in small ensembles that we 'll present in concert .
and with the beginners , we are trying lay a foundation to help them play together and learn what 's important in the process , " koegel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talking to the kids on their level is important , said one polyphonia musician excitement conquers nerves inside the academy , music from all sorts of instruments is streaming into the halls from every direction - even the offices are full of young musicians hard at work .
11-year-old yara khawaja practices cello under the watchful eyes of cellist thomas roesseler .
the young palestinian player can scarcely be seen behind her instrument , which she has now been learning for two years .
" i was still a little nervous at the beginning , " yara said .
" but it 's a great opportunity to be able to play with these professionals .
and after all , they 've all been really nice , " she added with a smile .
her fellow pupil faris amin is also excited : " it 's been great to get to play for three days and learn new things , " he said , before quickly getting back to his music .
a rare opportunity this institution sponsored by the barenboim-said foundation is one of the few music schools in the palestinian west bank .
the foundation itself is largely financed by the andalusian regional government -lrb- junta de andalucía -rrb- in spain . since the music school opened in 2006 , kids and young people have been able to learn music instruments and receive basic training in classical music there .
" workshops with international musicians open doors to them - not just to the world of classical music , but also in terms of cultural dialogue , " explained nabeel abboud ashkar , director of the music academy .
" especially in such an embattled region , that 's important . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for some young players , the dso musicians are both teachers and role models the musicians of the polyphonia ensemble agree .
" the people here are interested in classical music , " said martin koegel , " but they do n't have all of the training and educational opportunities that we have in europe , for instance .
and we want to do what we can to help . "
future professionals in the west bank for the first time in december 2010 , the polyphonia musicians have already offered similar workshops in other countries , most recently in algeria and morocco , now in ramalla .
then , as now , the projects were financed by the german foreign office and organized by deutsche welle .
the children 's industriousness and quick learning pace also make for great experiences for the musicians , they said .
as the workshop comes to a close , it starts to get serious for the young players .
the kasaba film theater in ramallah is the venue for the first of their three concerts , in addition to an extra concert performed by the beginners .
the more experienced musicians will play on stage alongside their workshop leaders from germany .
for mira abu elassal , a young cellist , that marks a very special moment : the young palestinian from nazareth hopes to become a professional musician .
concerts like these are a great way for her to get experience .
the program for the polyphonia ensemble 's evening includes works by josef gabriel rheinberger and wolfgang amadeus mozart .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 20.12.2010 germany calls for an eu database of organic producers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is a big market for organic produce following scandals over falsely labeled organic meat , germany wants the eu to set up a database of certified organic produce suppliers .
those in favor say such a system will provide greater transparency for consumers . in an effort to curb fraudulent abuse of organic labels , the german government is calling on the european commission to set up a europe-wide database of certified organic producers .
the database would be used to crack down on agents who have been using organic labels to sell conventional meat more expensively .
organic regulators would be obliged to immediately register any producer that failed a check .
" in case they withdraw a certificate , inspectors of organic food producers would immediately have to update the data base " , wolfgang reimer , in charge of organic agriculture at germany 's federal agricultural ministry , told the taz newspaper .
data sharing is vital bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : licenses for organic producers can be forged or abused currently , databases are not " compulsory " and not all inspectors share their data .
private inspectors are commissioned by state authorities to check whether organic food producers stick to the european union 's regulations governing organic produce .
among other things , the rules require farmers to abstain from using many conventional pesticides as well as mineral fertilizers .
only if farmers adhere to these rules can they obtain organic certification .
yet these paper certificates are relatively easy to forge , and there have been several cases of fraud in recent months surrounding labeling of organic produce .
in september , a german poultry farmer from the western town of delbrueck was tried for mixing conventional meat with expensive organic meat .
the new system proposed by germany 's agriculture ministry would allow supermarket chains to check whether their suppliers were still certified to deliver organic produce .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : producers acknowledge that customers need more transparency no license , no business in a recent cross-border case , italian pig farmer paolo zaccardi continued using copies of his old certificate even after the authorities had withdrawn the license .
using false documents he was able to sell cheap conventional meat to german customers as high-quality organic food , which earned him at least one million euros .
" we 've asked the european commission to intervene in italy " , wolfgang reimer told the taz , adding that pressure needed to be intensified on italian authorities to solve the issue .
" we 've had problems with italy for quite some time now " , reimer said .
in many cases , he said , inspectors had found pesticide residue in italian food sold in germany under an organic label .
the european farmers ' umbrella group copa-cogeca generally welcomes the initiative : " we are in favor of all initiatives that improve transparency " , eva coral from copa-cogeca told deutsche welle .
copa-cogeca is also working on suggestions for making labelling easier for consumers in the european union , by synchronizing labels across the bloc .
" one thing is important when we think about new initiatives " , said coral , " we do n't want more paperwork for the producers .
