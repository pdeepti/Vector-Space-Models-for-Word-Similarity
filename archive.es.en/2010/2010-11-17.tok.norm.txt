but plenty of hurdles still hinder e-commerce in europe . e-commerce is taking off domestically in many european countries , including germany .
but few companies in the region have ventured beyond their home markets to sell their products via the internet to consumers in other countries .
a patchwork of rules regulating consumer transactions across europe continues to inhibit many retailers from selling abroad .
and , unfortunately , a quick fix is not in sight .
" more than two thirds of retailers in -lrb- germany -rrb- say they do n't use the internet to sell abroad largely because they are unfamiliar with the legal situation in the various countries , " nikolaus lindner , a legal expert at the german subsidiary of ebay , told deutsche welle .
widening gap germany is hardly alone .
the gap between domestic and international e-commerce across the eu is widening as a result of cross-border barriers to online trade , according to the european commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebay is among the companies calling for harmonized rules and regulations from 2006 to 2008 , the share of all eu consumers who bought at least one item domestically over the internet increased from 27 percent to 33 percent , while cross-border e-commerce rose only marginally from 6 percent to 7 percent .
yet demand for cross-border service exists : one third of all eu citizens indicate they would consider buying a product from another member state via the internet because it 's cheaper or better or not available in their home country .
consumers and retailers hope the european commission 's proposed consumer rights directive will help clear the way for cross-border e-commerce .
the directive tackles , among other things , the prickly issue of legal fragmentation in areas such as product returns , guarantees and intellectual property rights as well as rules for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste .
big roadblock missing in this lineup , however , is value-added tax , which can vary widely from state to state .
many retailers see it as a significant obstacle to selling abroad .
the problem is , such taxes are a member-state issue , still outside the scope of eu legislation .
ebay 's lindner argues retailers would be much more willing to engage in cross-border selling if the risks of failing to comply with various national regulations could be eliminated through rules at the eu-level .
the cost of fragmentation , he says , is a heavy burden on business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission hopes to harmonize laws to boost e-commerce for many , full harmonization is the ultimate goal .
but it 's proving to be a true tug-of-war .
harmonization is among the most debated issues in both european parliament sessions and meetings of representatives of national ministries in the european council .
many parliament members see a form of " targeted harmonization " as the way forward .
" the problem is consumer protection rules have not been developed across europe in any organized fashion but in a completely uncoordinated way , " said andreas schwab , a member of the european parliament .
" you ca n't put into a policy paper that you will always take the highest level consumer protection from all states because that creates a problem . "
finland is a case in point , according to schwab .
currently , the minimum warranty period across europe is two and a half years but in the nordic country it 's 10 .
" this is costly and there is really no proof that a warranty that long is really helpful , " schwab told deutsche welle .
" but the finnish say ' this is our law and we wo n't sacrifice it for europe . " '
completely uncoordinated even consumer protection commissioner meglena kuneva , a big supporter of harmonization , acknowledges that the highest level of consumer protection does n't necessarily guarantee an optimal solution for consumers – especially if they end up footing the bill .
schwab expects eu members will initially find agreement in a few selected areas , such as return rights .
policymakers hope to reach some kind of consensus next month to move ahead with legislation early next year , but it 's unclear what they will achieve .
" we will move where we can and wait for proposals to bring the other areas in line later , " he said .
for those retailers unwilling to wait until rules and regulations are harmonized across europe , andreas duscha with the e-commerce center-handel in cologne recommended seeking legal support to be on the safe side .
" we urge retailers to work closely with lawyers and not just download some forms from the internet and draw up their own terms and conditions , " he told deutsche welle .

its order of events is predetermined in detail .
with about 2 million pilgrims visiting the holy sites of mecca within a few days , organizers have their hands full . it 's hot , it 's packed , and it may even be dangerous .
within a few days , about 2 million pilgrims visit the holy sites of mecca - a logistic feat that makes even the olympics or the soccer world cup look like a cakewalk . almost simultaneously , millions of pilgrims touch down at the airport in the nearby town of jeddah .
some 4,000 shuttle buses are in action .
desalination plants are working full blast in order to turn 130 million liters of water from the red sea into drinking water .
the hungry visitors devour 2 million loaves of bread every day .
and all that at temperatures near 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit , -rrb- even though it is in the middle of november .
the biggest problem , however , is security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia 's capital riad , harbor city jeddah , and the holy city of mecca about 100,000 security forces try to cope with the masses of believers .
they watch over a territory that spans 25 kilometers -lrb- 15 miles -rrb- from west to east .
the most dangerous spot is jamarat bridge .
until a few years ago , hundreds of thousands of people , moving in different directions , crowded through the very confined space there .
often , there were mass panics with hundreds of people dying .
in 2006 , almost 400 people died in the turmoil .
but today the pilgrims ' routes no longer cross there , since the former bridge has been turned into a five-story building with a one-way system on multiple levels , including escape routes .
a large part of the planning was done by german engineers .
despite the strains , the hajj is mandatory for all pious muslims who are healthy enough and can afford to go .
why ?
because it is one of the five basic duties of islam , just like fasting during ramadan , and daily prayers .
those who have already performed the hajj may call themselves a hajji .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hajj is one of the basic duties of islam the hajj goes back to the prophet muhammad who made his pilgrimage to mecca in 632 .
it always starts on the same day of the year : the eighth day of the last month of the islamic lunar calendar , the so-called hijri calendar .
the order of events is predetermined in every detail .
the most important stages are : day 1 stage 1 : getting ready arriving in mecca , pilgrims prepare for the hajj both inwardly and outwardly by entering what is called the " state of consecration . "
men put on the pilgrim 's garment comprised of two white unlined cloths .
from now on , they are not allowed to shave , comb their hair , or cut their hair and nails .
women are not allowed to cover their faces with veils .
stage 2 : the holy mosque bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of pilgrims at mecca 's holy mosque after entering the state of consecration , pilgrims head towards the holy mosque , the al-haram mosque .
right in the middle of it , there 's the kaaba .
it 's a brick-built cube with 12 x 10 meters of floor space ; it is 14 meters high .
during the pilgrimage season , the kaaba is decorated with a black curtain made from silk .
a koranic verse is embroidered on it with golden threads .
the kaaba is the geographic center of islam : muslims turn towards it when they pray .
according to religious tradition , adam built the kaaba .
it was destroyed by the flood , but abraham and his son ishmael rebuilt it .
in a corner of the kaaba there is a black stone .
supposedly , abraham received it as a gift from archangel gabriel .
the silver-edged stone is as big as a human hand .
experts still argue about whether the stone is a meteorite from outer space or if it 's actually made of earthly material such as glass .
pilgrims walk around the black stone seven times counter- clockwise .
whoever gets close enough to the kaaba , despite the masses , may kiss it .
stage 3 : departure to mina after having circled the kaaba seven times , muslims head towards the nearby town of mina .
there they 'll find prepared tents for the pilgrims to spend the night .
day 2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain of forgiveness stage 4 : mount arafat starting from mina , the journey continues to mount arafat , 25 kilometers east of mecca .
it 's believed to be a mountain of forgiveness .
this stage is among the most emotional parts of the hajj .
pilgrims spend a whole day praying and contemplating .
they ask god for forgiveness for their sins .
stage 5 : departure to muzdalifah in the evening , pilgrims walk to the holy valley of muzdalifah .
here they collect stones that they will need for the symbolic stoning of the devil during the next stage .
pilgrims also spend their second night there .
day 3 stage 6 : return to mina and stoning of the devil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial picture of jamarat bridge pilgrims return to mina even before sunrise .
they make their way to jamarat bridge – with the term " bridge " to be taken loosely .
in fact , it 's a highly complex five-story building with various ramps and towers .
three pillars stand out of it and symbolize the devil .
the pilgrims throw their collected stones from muzdalifah at the largest of the three pillars .
this is how they symbolically stone the devil .
stage 7 : the feast of sacrifice every pilgrim with enough money to do so buys a sheep or a goat and butchers it on the same day .
this means that hundreds of thousands of animals are killed within few hours .
pilgrims donate most of the sacrificed animals to the needy .
the feast of sacrifice is among the most important islamic feasts and it is celebrated by believers all around the world .
stage 8 : lifting the state of consecration the pilgrims may leave the state of consecration now , by symbolically having their hair cut .
women only have a strand of their hair made shorter .
all pilgrims may also put on their everyday clothes again .
stage 9 : return to mecca once more , the pilgrims return to the holy mosque in mecca and circle the kaaba seven times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the covered walkway between the hills safa and marwa stage 10 : the " running " between the hills safa and marwa , pilgrims now walk back and forth seven times .
they are thereby reviving a biblical scene of the old testament , when abraham 's wife hagar was desperately looking for water to prevent her son from dying of thirst .
finally an angel came to her help and showed her the way to the rescuing fountain zamzam .
stage 11 : return to mina all pilgrims return to their tents in mina .
day 4 -6 stage 12 : stoning of the devil in mina in the following days , pilgrims stay in mina and perform other symbolic stonings of the devil .
stage 13 : farewell to mecca to finish the hajj , pilgrims circle the kaaba seven times for a last time .

this power play has caused poland many headaches .
but new know-how in gas production could mark a turn in events . practically every winter , russia and its neighbors ukraine and belarus disagree on gas supply technicalities .
this dispute has endangered deliveries to poland .
the baltic sea pipeline , which will connect western european markets with major russian gas fields , has made matters worse .
warsaw 's politicians feel they will be at moscow 's mercy because russia can then shut off the supply without endangering its deliveries to germany .
but this headache could soon be over .
the largest deposits of shale gas in europe are assumed to be located on polish territory .
new technology from the united states could make it possible to exploit these gas reserves .
test drillings are planned all across the country .
according to geologists , poland could become the largest gas supplier in europe after norway and russia .
it would make the eastern european country rich - much richer than previously assumed , said energy expert pawel nierada from the sobieski institute in warsaw .
" conservative estimates already show that poland could suddenly become a serious exporter on the european gas market , " nierada said .
" the reserves exceed our country 's consumption many times over .
it 's hard to imagine what it would be like if the more optimistic estimates of the us government were to turn out to be true .
then , here in poland , we would have more gas than norway . "
skeptics question new technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland could soon control its own gas distribution natural gas which is produced in europe and asia has so far been relatively easy to access .
it lies in enormous bubbles under impermeable layers of earth , for example out of clay .
shale gas , on the other hand , is located in the middle of rock beds .
it 's nothing new that this valuable resource exists there .
but no one was ever interested in it before , because production was considered to be difficult and therefore uneconomical .
but that has changed .
in the united states , shale gas already covers 20 percent of gas consumption .
new technology used over the past few years has made this possible .
special drills first make their way into the ground vertically and then , when they reach the rock bed with the gas , bend into a horizontal position .
there , they pump a chemical liquid into the ground , which causes the rock bed to burst open .
the gas can then flow .
but many people are skeptical about this procedure , nierada said .
" there are also critical voices which say that the technology is still in its infancy - the experts from the russian gas company gazprom , for example , " he said .
" but in the united states , the production works .
and international firms believe it will be successful in poland , too .
otherwise , they would n't have already invested so much money in licenses and test drilling . "
the polish government has already issued some 60 licenses for test drillings , mainly to american companies .
it 's no wonder that this is cause for concern further to the east - in moscow .
after all , gas exports make up a significant part of russia 's gross domestic product .
they could stagnate or even decrease as a result of the polish finds .
gazprom has already admitted that it is n't able to sell as much to the united states as it used to because of the shale gas reserves there .
in a report , the company even said shale gas could " fundamentally change " the worldwide gas market .
us film highlights drawbacks us officials have billed shale gas a clean alternative , which could dominate the gas market by 2030 .
but despite its growing use there , shale gas extraction has caused controversy .
the hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , used to force out the gas has been a point of debate . earlier this year , the environmental protection agency asked gas companies to reveal what chemicals are used in deep extraction , addressing concerns by residents that the fracking had contaminated their drinking water . in the documentary " gasland , " which won the special jury prize at this year 's sundance film festival , filmmaker josh fox showed families in a drilling area whose tap water was even flammable . in addition , environmentalists have pointed out that the cleaner burning effects of shale gas were lessened when factoring in the energy expended to extract and transport it .
lack of political support production in poland could begin in ten years at the earliest , gas companies said .
but experts think it could start earlier .
then , the country could fulfill a dream it has had for hundreds of years : to be economically - and therefore also politically - independent from russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chevron is one of several us companies who have bought shale gas licenses in poland in spite of that , though , politicians across the spectrum have been slamming on the brakes , such as economics minister waldemar pawlak .
" up till now , shale gas has been more of a media phenomenon , " pawlak said .
" we still do n't know how difficult it will be to produce in poland .
it will also be more expensive than gas from conventional sources , because more drilling is necessary for the same amount of output . "
poland 's president bronislaw komorowski has been skeptical , too .
he said that all those production towers across the country would be an eyesore .
economic factors drive skepticism even if there are factual reasons for the skepticism , experts have long criticized polish politicians for being too passive .
for years , poland has relied on imports from russia without even considering the exploitation at least of conventional gas resources in the country .
this was mainly due to the monopoly of the state-owned gas firm pgnig .
" the company was never interested in producing gas itself , " nierada said .
" it earned its money very easily , after all , by buying gas from russia and simply adding its margin .
the company did n't care about how high the final price was . "
this passivity is now costing poland dearly .
in order to have enough gas for the coming winter , the state-owned company had to close a deal with gazprom for additional gas deliveries .
it even risked a battle with the eu commission , as brussels said russia was dictating unacceptable conditions .
the two sides finally reached an agreement at the end of october ensuring deliveries of russian natural gas until 2022 .
but such problems will possibly no longer exist in a few years - at least , not if poland turns into a european kuwait .

but the chief of the german central bank says banks should prepare for changes now . if there 's one thing the bankers and regulators gathered at the euro finance week in frankfurt agree on , it is that reform on a national level alone wo n't do much to stabilize the financial industry .
instead , they say that loopholes need to be plugged on an international level .
the german-centric economic forum started on monday , and there has been little doubt among attendees that action should be taken even before the stricter capital requirements of basel iii take effect in 2013 .
financial systems should be made more stable and resilient , they say .
german central bank president axel weber singled out german public-sector banks in his remarks .
" i believe , particularly in this sector , that the mikado-strategy that 's been pursued so far is leading nowhere , " weber said .
two such banks – bayernlb and westlb – recently failed in a merger attempt after receiving billions of taxpayer euros during the crisis .
the european commission set a new deadline of february 2011 for westlb to come up with ideas of how to sustain itself in the long term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels has given westlb a three-month deadline for restructuring weber said banks should n't be sluggish about making changes , and that they need to be proactive in preparing for coming regulations .
" changes will be coming to the market structure , " he said .
" there will be further changes .
the profiles of the actors will change , and the type and scope of the banking business will be affected .
" the refinancing structure of the banking system will change .
eventually there will also be less actors .
several will drop out – those which can not meet these new capital requirements . "
bankers have often complained about having to carry the high costs of the new regulations , but weber said that " a more stable financial system is worth the price . "
risks to international competition deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann spoke out against the notion of additional capital requirements for banks in germany , saying international competition is a concern .
what is needed is a method in which " banks which are a burden for the system – and therefore also taxpayers – can be eliminated , " he said .
" when you go to singapore , hong kong or shanghai today , then you experience what 's meant by location competition , " he said .
" and i believe we should always consider here what options we have to make the entire system more robust above all , but without giving up location advantages or tolerating location disadvantages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's ackermann defended big banking ackermann also defended large banking from skeptics who say banks were granted bailouts specifically because they had become too large to be allowed to fail .
" it is absolutely necessary that we define ourselves beyond national boundaries , " he said .
on monday a panel of economic journalists named ackermann ' european banker of the year ' for successfully leading his institution through the financial crisis .
asian banks ' ready ' according to wolfgang kirsch , ceo of dz bank , germany 's central cooperative bank , asian competitors are now primed and ready .
" after the asian crisis – this rough treatment which , in part , we 've been experiencing these days – this was something asian banks went through , " he said .
" and today they can happily call out , ' basel iii is n't an issue for us . '
anyone who says basel iii is n't an issue clearly has his own capital and liquidity .
and both of those things want to be utilized .
so we should keep an eye on that . "
the german central bank 's weber , however , foresees the need for regulation beyond just the banking system .
he said financial groups funneled billions of euros past regulators , agitating the financial crisis .
" we need to cast light into the shadows of the banking system , " he said .

both proponents and detractors are claiming to represent the interests of poor farmers . the mexican government first lifted its ban on experimental crops of genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- maize last year , freeing the way for field trials in the country where the crop was first domesticated . but , much like in europe where opposition to cultivating genetically modified crops has been strong , some small-scale farmers and environmental protection groups have criticized the government 's decision to add modified crops to the roughly 60 types of maize traditionally cultivated in mexico . for family farmers like rogelio sanchez , who lives in the village vicente guerrero , maize is more than just a crop and deserves to be protected from genetic alteration . " maize is sacred to us , " he said of the staple that has been cultivated in mexico for some 7,000 years .

" conflicting interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 60 sorts of maize cultivated in mexico a village of about 200 families , mostly working one-to-two-hectare subsistence farms , together with a group of farmers in vicente guerrero have joined forces to promote traditional farming methods that call for natural seeds , composting and no pesticides . the group 's agricultural methods are a far cry from the kind of agriculture being trialed in mexico 's north , although the government has n't yet given the green light to commercial production of gm maize , as it already has for genetically modified cotton . the modified maize would help farmers - especially cash-strapped small-time farmers - increase the size of their harvests without significantly increasing costs , according to ariel alvarez of mexico 's inter-secretarial commission on biosafety of genetically modified organisms -lrb- cibiogem -rrb- . " some people call it genetic contamination , but others say that this gene can help the people who need it most : small-time farmers , " he said .

are we going to call that contamination ?

" mexico is a symbol for monsanto , " she said .
" if they get permission for genetically modified maize here , it 's like a springboard for other countries where there has been opposition .

deutsche welle spoke to the eu 's special envoy for myanmar , piero fassino . deutsche welle : myanmar 's military government released opposition leader aung san suu kyi after more than 15 years of detention .
how does the european union consider this move ? piero fassino : the most important thing , for her family and her people , is that aung san suu kyi is finally free .
what is also important is that she is enabled to come back to politics now , as myanmar is in a crucial and delicate phase .
elections have been held and a new parliament elected .
the new parliament will start working next february .
this will lead to a new civilian government , which should take over power from the military junta .
therefore , it could be the beginning of a period of political and institutional change and it is essential that suu kyi can participate as a major player in this new political phase . the recent elections were one step towards what the military rulers call " disciplined democracy . "
does the european union consider these elections to be truly democratic ? elections were held in a context that was strongly controlled and conditioned by the regime , according to dubious electoral laws and regulations , certainly not in line with european and international accepted standards . however , it needs also to be noted that during the electoral campaign civil society and opposition forces proved significantly lively .
it is also relevant that , notwithstanding all the existing obstacles , opposition parties registered for the elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icon suu kyi has promised to look into poll irregularities it will be very important to see the results .
depending on how many elected representatives from the opposition forces and ethnic groups win seats in the local and national parliaments , we will be able to give a more complete evaluation of these elections . burma is a very multiethnic society .
what position does the eu have about the ethnic minorities ' struggle for more autonomy ? the european union condemns any form of hostility and oppression against ethnic minorities .
in the framework of the current political transition , ethnic communities need to be fully associated to , and become part of , the political process . one of the essential issues to be dealt with in the context of the transition is precisely how to ensure the respect of the rights of the minorities , their autonomy and the possibility to participate in the life of the country without restraints . have the elections and the release of aung san suu kyi opened up a chance for a transformation process ? the release of aung san suu kyi is a first step .
now more steps into the right direction are needed : the release of all political detainees and the opening of a true , meaningful dialogue between the junta , the democratic opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities . in her first public speech after her release , aung san suu kyi explicitly urged the authorities to start a dialogue and expressed her availability to take up responsibilities in the management of the transition .
such a dialogue has to be free , honest and needs to aim at a definitive democratic transition allowing myanmar to reach those standards of freedom and democracy which are the mark of all free nations .
how will the eu press the government of myanmar towards a more pluralistic system ? we should not take anything for granted .
we certainly hope that the release of aung san suu kyi can open a door , and it is for this reason that we are asking , after her release , for more meaningful acts , clearly showing the will of the authorities for a democratic transition . bildunterschrift : fassino calls for more aid for cyclone-devastated areas the international community must keep myanmar as a priority on its political agenda and must accompany and assist the democratic transition .
therefore , we need a policy aimed at increasing our relations with myanmar . we must increase humanitarian assistance particularly in those areas devastated by the nargis typhoon , where reconstruction and rehabilitation is needed .
we must increase development aid in vital sectors for the burmese people , such as water , education , health and assistance to children .
we must also help civil society to structure itself and accompany myanmar in building up the democratic institutions that it has never had so far . interview : ana lehman editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 17.11.2010 fate of tuna considered at key paris meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wwf wants drastic cuts to bluefish tuna fishing the international tuna trade 's watchdog is meeting in paris to decide catch quotas for atlantic bluefin tuna .
sparks could fly in the wake of a recent investigation implicating the regulators in mismanagement . representatives of the 48-member international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- have begun a 10-day meeting in the french capital to seek a compromise between boosting stocks of the dwindling atlantic bluefin tuna species and salvaging a multi-billion dollar industry spread across the mediterranean .
gemma parkes , a spokesperson for wwf mediterranean , said iccat is under increased pressure to impose further restrictions after a ban on bluefin tuna fishing failed to pass earlier this year .
" it 's showdown time for iccat - time to prove what they can do , " parkes told deutsche welle from the meeting in paris .
the wwf is an official observer of the iccat meeting and is allowed to sit through some of the meetings and sometimes intervene .
it 's unclear as yet just how radical iccat 's decisions will be on bluefin catch-quotas for next year .
iccat 's scientific committee said last month that extending the 2010 catch limit for each of the next three years would give bluefin in the eastern atlantic and mediterranean a 63-percent chance of attaining so-called " maximum sustainable yield " by 2022 .
the fishing industry supports this continuation of the current recovery program , but says additional cuts could devastate the fishing industry .
competing interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists have taken direct action to stop purse seining in the mediterranean .
" the fishing sector is already in a delicate situation .
a reduction in quotas could destroy companies and have ramifications far beyond just the vessel .
there are many industries relying on a vessel , like the harbor , traders and transport , " javier garat , president of europeche , a european organization which defends the interests of fishing enterprises , told deutsche welle .
environmental groups are pressing for much lower limits .
" a 60 % chance of recovery is n't good enough .
it 's not acceptable to allow for a 40 % chance of collapse .
who would get on a plane that only has a 40 % chance of arriving at its destination ? "
parkes said .
the wwf is pushing for quotas to be cut from 13,500 to between zero and 6,000 tons .
that they say would at least give stocks an 85 % chance of recovery by 2022 .
" we are also urging for an end to purse-seining and the establishment of ' no fishing zones ' in spawning areas , " gemma parkes added .
purse-seine fishing in the mediterranean traps bluefin – and other by-catch - in floating drawstring nets that loop around an enormous areas .
it can capture thousands of fish at once , which are then hauled to coastal " farms " where they are fattened for market .
wwf , along with ngos oceana , greenpeace , and the pew environment group , have called for a ban on this kind of fishing .
garat from europeche defends the practice and said " there 's no problem with purse-seine fishing as long as it complies with quotas . "
a ban on purse-seine fishing " is a realistic scenario , " said fabio hazin , chairman of the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- at a discussion forum .
rule breaking the meeting comes at a sensitive time for iccat , which came under fire in an investigative report earlier this month for failing to monitor the bluefin fishing industry effectively .
the report by the international consortium of investigative journalists -lrb- icij -rrb- painted a bleak picture of over-exploitation in the tuna trade .
" there has been a depressingly widespread lack of control and respect for rules , " parkes said .
she says that iccat " needs to be able to enforce the rules " .
the fishing industry fiercely denies breaking the rules .
" fishermen have made a huge sacrifice to comply with the recovery plan .
evidence shows that compliance with the recovery plan is very strict , " javier garat said .
iccat is expected to discuss the findings of the report pertaining to infringements of its rules during the meeting in paris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's appetite for sushi has fuelled the bluefish tuna industry threatened species driven by wholesale prices in japan that can top 100,000 dollars per specimen , industrial-scale fishing in the mediterranean and eastern atlantic has depleted stocks by almost three quarters over the past four decades , while the size of the average captured bluefin tuna has almost halved .
the japanese consume 80 percent of the atlantic bluefin catch , with americans appetites accounting for nine percent .
iccat member-states disagreed sharply going into the meeting as to whether next year 's quotas should remain at 13,500 tons , or be cut in half , or even suspended .
france 's fisheries minister , bruno le maire , said his country favored maintaining the 13,500 quota , a position backed by spain and italy .
britain and germany , along with eu fisheries commissioner maria damanaki , have come out in favor of a sharp reduction .
the european union was supposed to forge a common position going into the meeting , but has so far failed to do so .
" it 's going to be a tough two weeks .
tuna trading has a strong lobby that wants to keep the status quo .
we 're hopeful of a positive outcome and there 's a lot of international support on our side , " parkes said .
europeche president garat said the industry was facing increasingly stiff opposition .
" we have noticed that the pressure from ngos and is very big . "

among other things , vasconcelos addressed the outlook for european engagement in afghanistan .
deutsche welle : the war in afghanistan is now in its ninth year and the original goal of establishing a democracy there is all but gone .
europeans have been deeply skeptical of the afghan mission for a long time .
could europe do more in afghanistan ?
alvaro de vasconcelos : we can do more .
but to do more we should do it in a civilian way .
we are going to have the nato summit in a few days and the temptation will be to say the civilian training in afghanistan must be done by nato itself because the europeans are not doing as much as necessary and the americans will essentially work through nato .
i think this is as mistake .
because this will make civilians become part of a military operation .
we need to delink the civilian from the military .
of course the military is needed to guarantee the protection of the civilian training .
but we need to train the police in a different way then we train the military .
the police are trained to protect people , so we need to move toward this core aspect - human security and strategy where the main objective is to protect the civilians in afghanistan and not to kill the enemy .
because as president obama from day one said we should not be in afghanistan to kill civilians , but to protect them .
do you think europeans would support sending more police trainers to afghanistan ?
i think if there is a clear shift in the strategy in afghanistan in that we say we are not there to win a war , we are there to build an afghan state , an afghan army , an afghan police force , this would be welcome , because the people in europe want their soldiers home .
most public opinion polls in europe show that the majority of people want their soldiers back as soon as possible .
so if you devise a strategy that will bring your troops home - which is what president obama has announced - and you show that this is a crisis management and state-building operation that involves the united nations to a larger degree , that will get much more support in europe .
there has been a lot of debate in the past years whether or not the west should talk to the taliban .
what is your opinion ?
my sense is that there is more or less a consensus now in europe , and i think also in the united states , that there is a need for a political process .
you can speak about talking to taliban in two ways : one is to say we are talking with the good taliban .
we would then be dividing the taliban leadership by talking to local leaders and this would be a kind of counterinsurgency strategy .
this was used in iraq .
but the essential problem is that the taliban leadership will still be there and will still have a lot of support in some areas of the country and it will still be able to make war and create enormous difficulties to the international coalition . the other is to start communication at the highest level of the taliban in afghanistan .
but if you -lrb- do that , -rrb- the biggest difficulty is to decide what we want from them .
are we prepared to have the taliban in power again in kabul ?
what would be the impact of that in international public opinion - but especially in europe and the united states ?
the role of president karzai is a very contentious issue , which came up again recently after he confirmed reports that he was regularly accepting large sums of cash from iran .
is karzai for europe and the us still the best option to lead afghanistan ?
so far he is the only option .
no one has found a better option for afghanistan up to now .
we know that the elections were not very transparent and that it is important now to establish legitimacy and credibility .
but karzai is in power now , the election results were accepted after lots of doubts , and the europeans and the americans as well as the international community are now working with him .
and he is a very skillfull politician with many connections in afghanistan and he knows the country well , so he can start the process of talking with the taliban .
so he certainly is and will be playing an important political role .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 17.11.2010 terror alert levels reflect dangers difficult to verify großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are increasingly patrolling train stations and airports germany 's interior minister ordered increased security across the country after its terror alert showed a heightened threat of a terrorist attack .
many countries use similar warning systems , first developed in the us . terror alert levels reflect the existing threat of an imminent terrorist attack , though such danger can hardly be measured .
the us department of homeland security developed such an advisory system following the september 11 attacks .
authorities raise the threat level to " high " - or in the worst case " severe " - if they receive pertinent information from their own intelligence service or other security authorities .
they also rely on intelligence data from other countries they work closely with .
this can involve tapped conversations , respective information in the internet or credible leads from informants in the jihadist scene .
it is very rarely based on a concrete lead .
members of german intelligence services recently questioned islamists in afghanistan for an entire week about terror scenarios in germany and europe .
according to security authorities , some 40 islamists from germany are currently residing in pakistan and afghanistan .
at the same time , around 200 specialists from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- have continued to work on verifying whether the latest terror warnings from the us are true .
this includes intensifying the surveillance of some 130 so-called " endangerers " living in germany .
various degrees of security measures normally , a collection of several indicators form a qualitative new threat situation .
this can result in a concrete terror alert officially announced to the public , in turn generally leading to increased controls at critical points in a country 's security structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere said new , tangible intelligence has come to light in germany , the federal interior minister and his counterparts in the individual states are responsible for this move .
the scope of possible measures to resort to range from ordering increased passenger and luggage controls at airports , monitoring train stations and major road junctions to temporarily closing embassies at particularly vulnerable locations .
in the united states , the government set up the five-tiered color-coded threat level system to protect against future accusations that security authorities did n't take information about the imminent 9/11 attacks seriously enough and inform the public .
germany 's interior minister thomas de maiziere probably had similar thoughts in his mind .
continual warnings last month , authorities discovered two us-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen , one of which went through cologne-bonn airport in western germany undetected .
it turned out that lufthansa had already tipped off the interior ministry about the terrorist threat from yemen .
the airline 's warning reportedly reached de maiziere already at the beginning of october - three weeks before the package bombs were found in europe .
in recent weeks , german media have also repeatedly reported on alleged imminent terrorist attacks in the us and europe .
in addition , there have been continual warnings by western intelligence services that terrorists could plan an attack still before christmas - though the al qaeda network has in the past liked to publicly spread such warnings for propaganda purposes .
other governments have also reacted with official terror warnings to the supposed changed security situation .
germany is the third eu nation after britain and france to announce such a warning to its population .

no !
as dw reporter ali almakhlafi discovered , digital sheep are getting more and more popular . blood and dead sheep everywhere ?
spellbound pilgrims slaughtering live animals by the dozen ? that 's how a friend of mine imagined the feast of sacrifice .
and maybe some of dw 's readers thought so as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multicultural mecca : pilgrims from chad , china , lebanon , brazil , and austria i ca n't say that animal rights activists and vegetarians would enjoy what 's happening here – but the feast of sacrifice in mina is n't massacre-like , as my friend expected .
in accordance with islamic tradition , the sacrificial animals are slaughtered by a method called thaliba : their throats are cut and they bleed dry .
usually , this is done by a butcher or under professional instruction in one of the big butcheries .
the animals are definitively not being slaughtered on market squares , or even in front of a mosque .
the ritual took place on tuesday , november 16 , when muslims celebrated the feast of sacrifice .
however , animals are also sacrificed on the following two days of the hajj .
so far , however , i have n't seen any blood .
and that 's due to a new trend , which is quite popular in mecca , but also among turkish and arabic muslims living in germany : instead of sacrificing a real sheep , they sacrifice digital sheep - also called an electronic sheep or an e-sheep . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this sign indicates : ' no stone throwing ' i know it sounds funny , but it 's actually quite reasonable if you think about it .
on the one hand , muslims are supposed to sacrifice an animal during the hajj and then give the meat to the poor and needy .
on the other hand , there are n't all that many needy people in saudi arabia , at least not compared with other parts of the world , such as africa .
the idea is , you pay 400 rial -lrb- 80 euros -rrb- to a charitable foundation online , thereby purchasing a digital sheep .
the foundation will then make sure that a real sheep is slaughtered , and the meat is given to needy people in the respective country .
" i think that 's a great idea , " a saudi pilgrim tells me .
" what should we do with all the meat in our fridges ?
there are people who need it much more than we do . "
throwing stones at satan i 'm here as a journalist , so i did n't slaughter a sheep , not even a digital one .
but i wanted to at least stone the devil .
again , that all happened symbolically . on the hajj , pilgrims stone the devil numerous times .
it 's an important ritual , not only on the feast of sacrifice .
when throwing a stone , pilgrims speak out loud : " in the name of god , god is great . "
by doing so , they 're asking for god 's forgiveness for their sins .
the pilgrims have collected the stones they throw in the valley of muzdalifah .
2 million pilgrims arriving in mecca with 49 pebble stones each – that adds up to some 300 tons of stone .
after the hajj , saudi authorities make sure that the stones are transported back to muzdalifah .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i succeeded at ' stoning the devil ' a wall at one of the three pillars of jamarat bridge symbolizes the devil .
in fact , the huge bridge is a blessing for the hajj .
a couple of years ago , it was reconstructed as a five-story building with the help of german engineers .
now it 's a lot bigger , and also safer than before .
since it was rebuilt there have been no mass panics causing causalties , like there used to be .
a hair for every sin when the feast of sacrifice is over , pilgrims leave the state of consecration .
that was when i meet aaron from indonesia , who was holding scissors in his hand .
along with many other men here , he was about to have his head shaven .
shaving , or at least cutting ones hair , is an important part of the hajj .
i asked aaron why he wants to have his head shaven instead of just cutting off a little of his hair .
he said : " every hair on my head represents a sin to me .
and having my head shaved completely , it 's like being a newborn child – free of sins . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aaron from indonesia by the way , i discovered a funny aspect to the ritual .
there are , of course , men who have a bald head in the first place .
they either prefer a bald head or they lost their hair for some reason .
however , many of those men have their heads shaven symbolically , even though there 's really nothing to shave .
after the ritual , pilgrims take off their hajj garment and put on their everyday clothes .
and so i put on my jeans and polo shirt once again .
hajj attire " made in china " you might not have thought about the fact that many of the hajj clothes in mecca bear the label " made in china , " but they do .
muhammad , a pilgrim from china , told me that – and he 's very proud of it .
he 's part of the muslim minority in his country , which is even suppressed to some extent .
but muhammad still feels like a real chinese .
he told me he wished china would become the " world champion of global economy , " well , i guess china is heading in the right direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammad is proud that many hajj clothes are made in china again and again , i 'm excited by the international atmosphere over here .
i 'd like to answer a question posted by dw user detlev abebe , who wants to know : " what 's you 're impression of the majority of pilgrims ?
are they open-minded and tolerant – or do they just stick to a fixed ideology ? "
i would say it 's the former .
i definitely have n't seen anybody holding a fundamentalist speech in public .
most of the people here are just happy to experience a highly significant religious event together with pilgrims from around the world .
of course , the official saudi interpretation of islam is something different .
it 's very conservative , indeed .
yet , i 'm also surprised by how the conservative regulations are handled over here .
for example , there are rather strict rules for how men and women should interact with each other .
but they are n't taken that seriously by many pilgrims - especially when they 're not in public places .
and here 's another rather peculiar example : it 's illegal to sell cigarettes in mecca , but it 's allowed to smoke .
unveiled women i have n't found a definite answer to a question posted by dw user " milena " : " why is it that women are n't allowed to wear veils during the pilgrimage ? "
apparently , the rule says that women 's faces need to be recognizable during the hajj .
a religious scholar here told me that it probably goes back to how the prophets ' wives used to dress .
they were n't wearing veils .
and i personally think it could be a good sign that veils are n't a matter of religion , but a matter of tradition .

by doing so , they 're asking for god 's forgiveness for their sins .
the pilgrims have collected the stones they throw in the valley of muzdalifah .
2 million pilgrims arriving in mecca with 49 pebble stones each – that adds up to some 300 tons of stone .
after the hajj , saudi authorities make sure that the stones are transported back to muzdalifah .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i succeeded at ' stoning the devil ' a wall at one of the three pillars of jamarat bridge symbolizes the devil .
in fact , the huge bridge is a blessing for the hajj .
a couple of years ago , it was reconstructed as a five-story building with the help of german engineers .
now it 's a lot bigger , and also safer than before .
since it was rebuilt there have been no mass panics causing causalties , like there used to be .
a hair for every sin when the feast of sacrifice is over , pilgrims leave the state of consecration .
that was when i meet aaron from indonesia , who was holding scissors in his hand .
along with many other men here , he was about to have his head shaven .
shaving , or at least cutting ones hair , is an important part of the hajj .
i asked aaron why he wants to have his head shaven instead of just cutting off a little of his hair .
he said : " every hair on my head represents a sin to me .
and having my head shaved completely , it 's like being a newborn child – free of sins . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aaron from indonesia by the way , i discovered a funny aspect to the ritual .
there are , of course , men who have a bald head in the first place .
they either prefer a bald head or they lost their hair for some reason .
however , many of those men have their heads shaven symbolically , even though there 's really nothing to shave .
after the ritual , pilgrims take off their hajj garment and put on their everyday clothes .
and so i put on my jeans and polo shirt once again .
hajj attire " made in china " you might not have thought about the fact that many of the hajj clothes in mecca bear the label " made in china , " but they do .
muhammad , a pilgrim from china , told me that – and he 's very proud of it .
he 's part of the muslim minority in his country , which is even suppressed to some extent .
but muhammad still feels like a real chinese .
he told me he wished china would become the " world champion of global economy , " well , i guess china is heading in the right direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammad is proud that many hajj clothes are made in china again and again , i 'm excited by the international atmosphere over here .
i 'd like to answer a question posted by dw user detlev abebe , who wants to know : " what 's you 're impression of the majority of pilgrims ?
are they open-minded and tolerant – or do they just stick to a fixed ideology ? "
i would say it 's the former .
i definitely have n't seen anybody holding a fundamentalist speech in public .
most of the people here are just happy to experience a highly significant religious event together with pilgrims from around the world .
of course , the official saudi interpretation of islam is something different .
it 's very conservative , indeed .
yet , i 'm also surprised by how the conservative regulations are handled over here .
for example , there are rather strict rules for how men and women should interact with each other .
but they are n't taken that seriously by many pilgrims - especially when they 're not in public places .
and here 's another rather peculiar example : it 's illegal to sell cigarettes in mecca , but it 's allowed to smoke .
unveiled women i have n't found a definite answer to a question posted by dw user " milena " : " why is it that women are n't allowed to wear veils during the pilgrimage ? "
apparently , the rule says that women 's faces need to be recognizable during the hajj .
a religious scholar here told me that it probably goes back to how the prophets ' wives used to dress .
they were n't wearing veils .
and i personally think it could be a good sign that veils are n't a matter of religion , but a matter of tradition .

dw 's bernd riegert believes ireland should accept aid - fast . the longer you wait , the more costly it gets .
in view of its rampant national debt and heavily indebted banks , ireland will have to accept help from the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
it is only a matter of days , maybe hours .
the eu finance ministers ' plans are ready , but ireland has so far steadfastly resisted applying for a state bailout .
this is a case of misplaced pride on the part of the country 's stricken prime minister , brian cowen .
the former celtic tiger is about to be skinned . cowen did not want to take responsibility for such action in front of his shaken voters .
he also fears the strict conditions that loans entail .
ireland would probably have to raise its extremely low corporate taxes and aggravate the economic crisis further still . every day of hesitation forces the cost of loans on the financial markets to skyrocket , while share prices drop . ireland 's finance minister has finally admitted that the problems seem to have become too big for the small country .
the crisis does not only affect ireland , it affects all of europe .
after all , the european central bank has tirelessly been pumping money into the irish budget , where it buys government bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoid a chain reaction ireland is as good as bankrupt and the eu 's larger member states , including britain that does not have the euro as its currency , will have to help the nation in order to protect their own interests .
ireland is indebted for the most part to britain , germany , the us and france .
an irish insolvency would hit the banks in europe : for instance germany 's state-run hre bank .
it is clearly in europe 's own interest to save ireland - the sooner , the better .
a chain reaction might still be averted , although portugal and possibly spain also stand on the edge of a precipice .
that is what european council president herman van rompuy must have had in mind when he said that the 16 states of the eurozone and the entire eu are fighting for survival .
it is alarming that the financial markets are reacting with a drop in the price of government bonds to chancellor angela merkel 's remarks that private investors should share the costs of state insolvencies after 2013 . debtors want to make money , but they do n't want to carry the risks , and that has to stop .
however , financial markets and investors currently still have the upper hand .
they act and politics is forced to react by using taxpayers ' money to buy time for bankrupt states .
in essence , that is what the bailout is : a safety net .
whether this structure will manage to stabilize the european currency and the financial system remains to be seen .
we are in the midst of a huge experiment .
in the case of greece , 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- were pledged and about 40 billion have been paid .
the next installment ca n't be made because the country has n't completely fulfilled its obligations .
the next crisis is already on the horizon .
the safety net is beginning to tear .

the former celtic tiger , meanwhile , insists it does n't need to be rescued . europe edged closer to its second bailout of a eurozone state on wednesday , as the bloc 's finance ministers announced a joint mission with the imf to ireland directed at stepping up talks on its devastated banking sector .
" the situation is very pressing and very , very serious and we do n't have any time to waste , " eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters after meetings in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they are talks , not bailout negotiations : lenihan " it is essential that confidence in the irish banking sector is restored for the sake of financial stability in europe and for the sake of restoring confidence in the economy . "
irish finance minister brian lenihan confirmed that the emergency talks would begin in dublin on thursday but issued no details on what shape the bailout could take or its possible size .
" we have agreed to look at the structural problems in the irish banks in the light of recent market pressures and assess what needs to be done because banking questions are technical and difficult , " lenihan told irish state radio on wednesday .
dublin reluctant to become ' europe 's lackey ' according to an article published in the wall street journal on wednesday , the irish banking sector is up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering for themselves .
investors fear the final figure could be even higher given rising mortgage arrears , deposit outflows and higher funding costs .
nevertheless , irish leaders continue to refuse that neither the country nor its banks are in need of a bailout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish do n't want to beg like the orphan , oliver twist " what we want to concentrate on now is in a focused way , over coming days , to sit down and see in what way can assistance be provided to ensure that these issues can be dealt with properly and appropriately , " prime minister brian cowen told parliament on wednesday after news of thursday 's emergency talks had emerged .
" there has been no question of the government -lsb- being -rsb- in a negotiation for a bailout , " he said , dismissing the term as pejorative and referring to the fact that the state of ireland is pre-funded until the middle of next year .
meanwhile , the irish people share their prime minister 's resistance to financial assistance from brussels or anywhere else ; in the streets of the irish capital , a european bailout would be a downright " humiliation . "
sean , a 54-year-old , called it " the final insult to the good and decent people of this country , to go like a beggar in brussels and ask that very seasonal question - please sir , can i have some more ? " referring to the charles dickens character oliver twist .
another dubliner , adam , 42 , said it would be " the end of the independent irish republic . "
" i would rather be poor and free than a poor lackey of europe .
it 's time to stand up and be irish once again , " he added .
more eu members to require assistance ?
also on wednesday , eu finance ministers pledged to agree on stricter debt rules by mid-2011 , as well as on a new rescue fund for dangerously indebted countries such as greece - which received substantial eu funds earlier this year to avoid bankruptcy - and a number of other eurozone members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von rompuy : resolution of the crisis is critical for the eu portugal and spain , which are already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , have both alluded to budgetary difficulties .

but the ministers gave a clear signal that " determined and coordinated " action had to be taken to resolve the debt crisis that is threatening the future financial stability of europe and the 16-member , single-currency eurozone .
" if we do n't survive with the eurozone we will not survive with the european union , " european council president herman von rompuy said .

however , financial markets and investors currently still have the upper hand .
they act and politics is forced to react by using taxpayers ' money to buy time for bankrupt states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 17.11.2010 terror alert levels reflect dangers difficult to verify großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are increasingly patrolling train stations and airports germany 's interior minister ordered increased security across the country after its terror alert showed a heightened threat of a terrorist attack .
many countries use similar warning systems , first developed in the us . terror alert levels reflect the existing threat of an imminent terrorist attack , though such danger can hardly be measured .
the us department of homeland security developed such an advisory system following the september 11 attacks .
authorities raise the threat level to " high " - or in the worst case " severe " - if they receive pertinent information from their own intelligence service or other security authorities .
they also rely on intelligence data from other countries they work closely with .
this can involve tapped conversations , respective information in the internet or credible leads from informants in the jihadist scene .
it is very rarely based on a concrete lead .
members of german intelligence services recently questioned islamists in afghanistan for an entire week about terror scenarios in germany and europe .
according to security authorities , some 40 islamists from germany are currently residing in pakistan and afghanistan .
at the same time , around 200 specialists from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- have continued to work on verifying whether the latest terror warnings from the us are true .
this includes intensifying the surveillance of some 130 so-called " endangerers " living in germany .
various degrees of security measures normally , a collection of several indicators form a qualitative new threat situation .
this can result in a concrete terror alert officially announced to the public , in turn generally leading to increased controls at critical points in a country 's security structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere said new , tangible intelligence has come to light in germany , the federal interior minister and his counterparts in the individual states are responsible for this move .
the scope of possible measures to resort to range from ordering increased passenger and luggage controls at airports , monitoring train stations and major road junctions to temporarily closing embassies at particularly vulnerable locations .
in the united states , the government set up the five-tiered color-coded threat level system to protect against future accusations that security authorities did n't take information about the imminent 9/11 attacks seriously enough and inform the public .
germany 's interior minister thomas de maiziere probably had similar thoughts in his mind .
continual warnings last month , authorities discovered two us-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen , one of which went through cologne-bonn airport in western germany undetected .
it turned out that lufthansa had already tipped off the interior ministry about the terrorist threat from yemen .
the airline 's warning reportedly reached de maiziere already at the beginning of october - three weeks before the package bombs were found in europe .
in recent weeks , german media have also repeatedly reported on alleged imminent terrorist attacks in the us and europe .
in addition , there have been continual warnings by western intelligence services that terrorists could plan an attack still before christmas - though the al qaeda network has in the past liked to publicly spread such warnings for propaganda purposes .
other governments have also reacted with official terror warnings to the supposed changed security situation .
germany is the third eu nation after britain and france to announce such a warning to its population .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 17.11.2010 shale gas could ensure poland 's independence from russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia often flexes its muscles over gas deliveries in winter winter is approaching - a time in which europe particularly feels russia 's grip on the energy market .
this power play has caused poland many headaches .
but new know-how in gas production could mark a turn in events . practically every winter , russia and its neighbors ukraine and belarus disagree on gas supply technicalities .
this dispute has endangered deliveries to poland .
the baltic sea pipeline , which will connect western european markets with major russian gas fields , has made matters worse .
warsaw 's politicians feel they will be at moscow 's mercy because russia can then shut off the supply without endangering its deliveries to germany .
but this headache could soon be over .
the largest deposits of shale gas in europe are assumed to be located on polish territory .
new technology from the united states could make it possible to exploit these gas reserves .
test drillings are planned all across the country .
according to geologists , poland could become the largest gas supplier in europe after norway and russia .
it would make the eastern european country rich - much richer than previously assumed , said energy expert pawel nierada from the sobieski institute in warsaw .
" conservative estimates already show that poland could suddenly become a serious exporter on the european gas market , " nierada said .
" the reserves exceed our country 's consumption many times over .
it 's hard to imagine what it would be like if the more optimistic estimates of the us government were to turn out to be true .
then , here in poland , we would have more gas than norway . "
skeptics question new technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland could soon control its own gas distribution natural gas which is produced in europe and asia has so far been relatively easy to access .
it lies in enormous bubbles under impermeable layers of earth , for example out of clay .
shale gas , on the other hand , is located in the middle of rock beds .
it 's nothing new that this valuable resource exists there .
but no one was ever interested in it before , because production was considered to be difficult and therefore uneconomical .
but that has changed .
in the united states , shale gas already covers 20 percent of gas consumption .
new technology used over the past few years has made this possible .
special drills first make their way into the ground vertically and then , when they reach the rock bed with the gas , bend into a horizontal position .
there , they pump a chemical liquid into the ground , which causes the rock bed to burst open .
the gas can then flow .
but many people are skeptical about this procedure , nierada said .
" there are also critical voices which say that the technology is still in its infancy - the experts from the russian gas company gazprom , for example , " he said .
" but in the united states , the production works .
and international firms believe it will be successful in poland , too .
otherwise , they would n't have already invested so much money in licenses and test drilling . "
the polish government has already issued some 60 licenses for test drillings , mainly to american companies .
it 's no wonder that this is cause for concern further to the east - in moscow .
after all , gas exports make up a significant part of russia 's gross domestic product .
they could stagnate or even decrease as a result of the polish finds .
gazprom has already admitted that it is n't able to sell as much to the united states as it used to because of the shale gas reserves there .
in a report , the company even said shale gas could " fundamentally change " the worldwide gas market .
us film highlights drawbacks us officials have billed shale gas a clean alternative , which could dominate the gas market by 2030 .
but despite its growing use there , shale gas extraction has caused controversy .
the hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , used to force out the gas has been a point of debate . earlier this year , the environmental protection agency asked gas companies to reveal what chemicals are used in deep extraction , addressing concerns by residents that the fracking had contaminated their drinking water . in the documentary " gasland , " which won the special jury prize at this year 's sundance film festival , filmmaker josh fox showed families in a drilling area whose tap water was even flammable . in addition , environmentalists have pointed out that the cleaner burning effects of shale gas were lessened when factoring in the energy expended to extract and transport it .
lack of political support production in poland could begin in ten years at the earliest , gas companies said .
but experts think it could start earlier .
then , the country could fulfill a dream it has had for hundreds of years : to be economically - and therefore also politically - independent from russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chevron is one of several us companies who have bought shale gas licenses in poland in spite of that , though , politicians across the spectrum have been slamming on the brakes , such as economics minister waldemar pawlak .
" up till now , shale gas has been more of a media phenomenon , " pawlak said .
" we still do n't know how difficult it will be to produce in poland .
it will also be more expensive than gas from conventional sources , because more drilling is necessary for the same amount of output . "
poland 's president bronislaw komorowski has been skeptical , too .
he said that all those production towers across the country would be an eyesore .
economic factors drive skepticism even if there are factual reasons for the skepticism , experts have long criticized polish politicians for being too passive .
for years , poland has relied on imports from russia without even considering the exploitation at least of conventional gas resources in the country .
this was mainly due to the monopoly of the state-owned gas firm pgnig .
" the company was never interested in producing gas itself , " nierada said .
" it earned its money very easily , after all , by buying gas from russia and simply adding its margin .
the company did n't care about how high the final price was . "
this passivity is now costing poland dearly .
in order to have enough gas for the coming winter , the state-owned company had to close a deal with gazprom for additional gas deliveries .
it even risked a battle with the eu commission , as brussels said russia was dictating unacceptable conditions .
the two sides finally reached an agreement at the end of october ensuring deliveries of russian natural gas until 2022 .
but such problems will possibly no longer exist in a few years - at least , not if poland turns into a european kuwait .

but the chief of the german central bank says banks should prepare for changes now . if there 's one thing the bankers and regulators gathered at the euro finance week in frankfurt agree on , it is that reform on a national level alone wo n't do much to stabilize the financial industry .
instead , they say that loopholes need to be plugged on an international level .
the german-centric economic forum started on monday , and there has been little doubt among attendees that action should be taken even before the stricter capital requirements of basel iii take effect in 2013 .
financial systems should be made more stable and resilient , they say .
german central bank president axel weber singled out german public-sector banks in his remarks .
" i believe , particularly in this sector , that the mikado-strategy that 's been pursued so far is leading nowhere , " weber said .
two such banks – bayernlb and westlb – recently failed in a merger attempt after receiving billions of taxpayer euros during the crisis .
the european commission set a new deadline of february 2011 for westlb to come up with ideas of how to sustain itself in the long term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels has given westlb a three-month deadline for restructuring weber said banks should n't be sluggish about making changes , and that they need to be proactive in preparing for coming regulations .
" changes will be coming to the market structure , " he said .
" there will be further changes .
the profiles of the actors will change , and the type and scope of the banking business will be affected .
" the refinancing structure of the banking system will change .
eventually there will also be less actors .
several will drop out – those which can not meet these new capital requirements . "
bankers have often complained about having to carry the high costs of the new regulations , but weber said that " a more stable financial system is worth the price . "
risks to international competition deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann spoke out against the notion of additional capital requirements for banks in germany , saying international competition is a concern .
what is needed is a method in which " banks which are a burden for the system – and therefore also taxpayers – can be eliminated , " he said .
" when you go to singapore , hong kong or shanghai today , then you experience what 's meant by location competition , " he said .
" and i believe we should always consider here what options we have to make the entire system more robust above all , but without giving up location advantages or tolerating location disadvantages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's ackermann defended big banking ackermann also defended large banking from skeptics who say banks were granted bailouts specifically because they had become too large to be allowed to fail .
" it is absolutely necessary that we define ourselves beyond national boundaries , " he said .
on monday a panel of economic journalists named ackermann ' european banker of the year ' for successfully leading his institution through the financial crisis .
asian banks ' ready ' according to wolfgang kirsch , ceo of dz bank , germany 's central cooperative bank , asian competitors are now primed and ready .
" after the asian crisis – this rough treatment which , in part , we 've been experiencing these days – this was something asian banks went through , " he said .
" and today they can happily call out , ' basel iii is n't an issue for us . '
anyone who says basel iii is n't an issue clearly has his own capital and liquidity .
and both of those things want to be utilized .
so we should keep an eye on that . "
the german central bank 's weber , however , foresees the need for regulation beyond just the banking system .
he said financial groups funneled billions of euros past regulators , agitating the financial crisis .
" we need to cast light into the shadows of the banking system , " he said .

two new studies say the country is n't doing enough to attract foreign talent and should do more to promote a " welcoming culture . " germany is only a moderately attractive destination for skilled immigrants , according to two recently released studies .
the conclusion of one of the studies , conducted by the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , is that the federal government is doing too little to attract qualified professionals from other countries .
" skilled professionals and students are n't waiting in line to bring their abilities to germany , " dihk president hans heinrich driftmann told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , adding , " this should worry us . "
according to one survey of 47 chambers of foreign trade , germany earned an attractiveness score of 2.8 , with one signifying " attractive " and five meaning " unattractive . "
the report states that germany needs to work on promoting a " welcoming culture , " according to the frankfurter rundschau , which published the findings of the report prior to its release .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driftmann says germany should reduce red tape qualified young turks living in germany were reported to feel undesired , while polish professionals in germany complained they were confronted by stereotypes casting them as " asparagus cutters and farming assistants . "
' sprechen sie deutsch ? '
according to the report , germany 's main problem in attracting skilled immigrants is its language .
german , it claims , is faring poorly internationally when compared to english or french .
the dihk blamed the problem on cuts to funding for the goethe institute , an organization that promotes the german language worldwide .
the german academic exchange service , which promotes foreign students coming to germany , also faced limited resources . the report also extended its criticism to the red tape surrounding visas and work permits in germany , which it said were complicated and confusing - and inconsistent from one jurisdiction to the next .
it further stated that over half a dozen eu member states regularly complained that their qualifications and professional degrees were not recognized in germany .
lowering the hurdles the dihk found a practice requiring foreign students to procure work permits and jobs within a year in germany to be counterproductive .
it said that this practice had led many qualified students to leave germany during the recent financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of executives and scholars leave germany every year the report recommended lowering the hurdles for foreign professionals to work in germany - at least for engineers and it workers .
the dihk also wants to see one regulation changed that automatically grants foreigners the right to settle in germany if they earn 66,000 euros -lrb- $ 89,100 -rrb- a year .
the chamber of commerce wants resident rights granted to immigrants who earn 40,000 euros or more .
the bottom line , according to driftmann , is that germany must be more welcoming to prospective immigrants .
only ' second-best ' the same could have been the credo of another study , conducted by the bib , a federal institute in the western city of wiesbaden , which studies germany 's population .
the institute 's study , which focuses on highly-qualified professional immigrants , concluded that germany was not a first-choice destination , but rather seen as a second- or third-best option .
the study , commissioned by the bertelsmann foundation , concluded that , between 2005 and 2009 , germany had lost around 1,500 executives and scholars yearly to other european union countries . nations like sweden , spain , austria , the united kingdom and belgium were much more attractive destinations for skilled workers , it said .
it remains unclear whether the opening of the german labor market to citizens of eastern eu states next year will change the situation , according to gunter thielen , chairman of the bertelsmann foundation 's board of directors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thielen says germany can learn from canada and sweden " we can look at other societies with successful immigration policies and adopt the best parts of their systems , " he said .
the bertelsmann foundation recommended taking aspects of the canadian or british models , which focus on immigrants ' qualifications and combining them with the swedish system , which is focused directly on the requirements of the labor market .

greece 's 2010 deficit is even higher than thought . austrian finance minister josef proell announced wednesday that the decision to grant the delay was made on the sidelines of the eu finance ministers ' meeting in bruessels on tuesday night .
proell said austria would not release its share of the money because greece had not fulfilled the requirements of the bailout agreement .
however , the eu has denied that the next loan payout will be delayed .
the office of the eu 's monetary affairs chief refuted austria 's claims , saying " it has always been the case that the actual release of the third tranche should be taken in december and that the release will be in january . "
the european union and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- agreed to lend athens 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- earlier this year to save the debt-wracked nation from bankruptcy . the money is to be doled out over three years , in accordance with the country 's progress in reducing its budget deficit .
in return , the greek government of prime minister giorgos papandreou agreed to enact drastic austerity measures in order to get the deficit under 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2014 . on monday the european statistics agency eurostat announced that greece 's 2009 deficit would exceed earlier forecasts , climbing 2 points to 15.4 of gdp , almost 2 points higher than the previously indicated 13.6 percent .

security is to be increased at all airports and train stations . germany 's interior minister has announced that security is being stepped up at airports and train stations across the country .
thomas de maiziere told reporters in berlin on wednesday that the move came in light of concrete information received , indicating that a terrorist attack was being planned for the end of november in germany .
" from today , there will be a visible police presence .
i thought it should be explained to citizens , " de maiziere said .
" there is reason for concern , but no reason for hysteria . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere : ' reason for concern , not hysteria ' de maiziere called on all citizens to be vigilant .
any unattended packages or bags should be reported to security officials . the increased alert applied to all of germany .
three scenarios the government did not provide any details , but security officials in berlin said three suspected threats had arisen . speaking on condition of anonymity , the officials said one involved senior al qaeda leader younis al mauretani , who was planning an operation against europe and the united states . the second involved a plot to carry out coordinated armed attacks similar to those that killed 166 people in the indian city of mumbai in 2008 .
indications emerged that between 15 and 25 militants were lying in wait in europe preparing for such a strike , potentially in germany , the officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the scenarios resembles the 2008 attacks in mumbai a third scenario pointed to sleeper cells already in germany , though no specific targets were identified . although the evidence pointed to a real threat , de maiziere called on germans to avoid overreating . " it is not cause and should not be cause for us to change our daily lives totally , " the minister said , comparing the situation to the security alarm surrounding germany 's federal elections in 2009 .
de maiziere said " a tip from an international partner after the yemen incident " alerted the interior ministry to the potential threat .
past threats from yemen earlier this month , the discovery of two us-bound parcel bombs sent via airmail from yemen raised new fears about security .
the parcel bombs coincided with package bombs sent by greek militants to chancellor angela merkel in berlin .
the german government responded by grounding all cargo planes originating from yemen , a ban that has since been lifted .
in october , de maiziere drew criticism after he warned against " alarmism " in the wake of travel alerts for europe issued by the united states , britain and japan .

both proponents and detractors are claiming to represent the interests of poor farmers . the mexican government first lifted its ban on experimental crops of genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- maize last year , freeing the way for field trials in the country where the crop was first domesticated . but , much like in europe where opposition to cultivating genetically modified crops has been strong , some small-scale farmers and environmental protection groups have criticized the government 's decision to add modified crops to the roughly 60 types of maize traditionally cultivated in mexico . for family farmers like rogelio sanchez , who lives in the village vicente guerrero , maize is more than just a crop and deserves to be protected from genetic alteration . " maize is sacred to us , " he said of the staple that has been cultivated in mexico for some 7,000 years .
" it 's the foundation of our diet and a part of our cultural identity that we inherited from our forefathers . " conflicting interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 60 sorts of maize cultivated in mexico a village of about 200 families , mostly working one-to-two-hectare subsistence farms , together with a group of farmers in vicente guerrero have joined forces to promote traditional farming methods that call for natural seeds , composting and no pesticides . the group 's agricultural methods are a far cry from the kind of agriculture being trialed in mexico 's north , although the government has n't yet given the green light to commercial production of gm maize , as it already has for genetically modified cotton . the modified maize would help farmers - especially cash-strapped small-time farmers - increase the size of their harvests without significantly increasing costs , according to ariel alvarez of mexico 's inter-secretarial commission on biosafety of genetically modified organisms -lrb- cibiogem -rrb- . " some people call it genetic contamination , but others say that this gene can help the people who need it most : small-time farmers , " he said . " the farmers who do n't have the money to buy pesticides and end up losing half of their harvests could benefit .
are we going to call that contamination ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters say gm maize would increase harvest sizes calming fears to help calm people 's fears about gm crops , alvarez and other officials recently opened the commission 's doors to inform the public and take questions . one of their arguments is that the government does not force farmers to buy and use the modified seeds sold by monsanto and other companies . the commission also claims that more research into genetically modified crops is necessary , and that it could become a substantial source of future income and transform mexico from a niche market into a global player . aleira lara of the environmental protection group greenpeace has , however , warned that the government risks opening a pandora 's box , because it is not known how the gm crops will affect indigenous varieties of maize . she added that mexico , the birthplace of corn crops , was a valuable country for biotech companies trying to win over regulators to their cause . " mexico is a symbol for monsanto , " she said .
" if they get permission for genetically modified maize here , it 's like a springboard for other countries where there has been opposition .

deutsche welle spoke to the eu 's special envoy for myanmar , piero fassino . deutsche welle : myanmar 's military government released opposition leader aung san suu kyi after more than 15 years of detention .
how does the european union consider this move ? piero fassino : the most important thing , for her family and her people , is that aung san suu kyi is finally free .
what is also important is that she is enabled to come back to politics now , as myanmar is in a crucial and delicate phase .
elections have been held and a new parliament elected .
the new parliament will start working next february .
this will lead to a new civilian government , which should take over power from the military junta .
therefore , it could be the beginning of a period of political and institutional change and it is essential that suu kyi can participate as a major player in this new political phase . the recent elections were one step towards what the military rulers call " disciplined democracy . "
does the european union consider these elections to be truly democratic ? elections were held in a context that was strongly controlled and conditioned by the regime , according to dubious electoral laws and regulations , certainly not in line with european and international accepted standards . however , it needs also to be noted that during the electoral campaign civil society and opposition forces proved significantly lively .
it is also relevant that , notwithstanding all the existing obstacles , opposition parties registered for the elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icon suu kyi has promised to look into poll irregularities it will be very important to see the results .
depending on how many elected representatives from the opposition forces and ethnic groups win seats in the local and national parliaments , we will be able to give a more complete evaluation of these elections . burma is a very multiethnic society .
what position does the eu have about the ethnic minorities ' struggle for more autonomy ? the european union condemns any form of hostility and oppression against ethnic minorities .
in the framework of the current political transition , ethnic communities need to be fully associated to , and become part of , the political process . one of the essential issues to be dealt with in the context of the transition is precisely how to ensure the respect of the rights of the minorities , their autonomy and the possibility to participate in the life of the country without restraints . have the elections and the release of aung san suu kyi opened up a chance for a transformation process ? the release of aung san suu kyi is a first step .
now more steps into the right direction are needed : the release of all political detainees and the opening of a true , meaningful dialogue between the junta , the democratic opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities . in her first public speech after her release , aung san suu kyi explicitly urged the authorities to start a dialogue and expressed her availability to take up responsibilities in the management of the transition .
such a dialogue has to be free , honest and needs to aim at a definitive democratic transition allowing myanmar to reach those standards of freedom and democracy which are the mark of all free nations .
how will the eu press the government of myanmar towards a more pluralistic system ? we should not take anything for granted .
we certainly hope that the release of aung san suu kyi can open a door , and it is for this reason that we are asking , after her release , for more meaningful acts , clearly showing the will of the authorities for a democratic transition . bildunterschrift : fassino calls for more aid for cyclone-devastated areas the international community must keep myanmar as a priority on its political agenda and must accompany and assist the democratic transition .
therefore , we need a policy aimed at increasing our relations with myanmar . we must increase humanitarian assistance particularly in those areas devastated by the nargis typhoon , where reconstruction and rehabilitation is needed .
we must increase development aid in vital sectors for the burmese people , such as water , education , health and assistance to children .
we must also help civil society to structure itself and accompany myanmar in building up the democratic institutions that it has never had so far . interview : ana lehman editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

among other things , vasconcelos addressed the outlook for european engagement in afghanistan .
deutsche welle : the war in afghanistan is now in its ninth year and the original goal of establishing a democracy there is all but gone .
europeans have been deeply skeptical of the afghan mission for a long time .
could europe do more in afghanistan ?
alvaro de vasconcelos : we can do more .
but to do more we should do it in a civilian way .
we are going to have the nato summit in a few days and the temptation will be to say the civilian training in afghanistan must be done by nato itself because the europeans are not doing as much as necessary and the americans will essentially work through nato .
i think this is as mistake .
because this will make civilians become part of a military operation .
we need to delink the civilian from the military .
of course the military is needed to guarantee the protection of the civilian training .
but we need to train the police in a different way then we train the military .
the police are trained to protect people , so we need to move toward this core aspect - human security and strategy where the main objective is to protect the civilians in afghanistan and not to kill the enemy .
because as president obama from day one said we should not be in afghanistan to kill civilians , but to protect them .
do you think europeans would support sending more police trainers to afghanistan ?
i think if there is a clear shift in the strategy in afghanistan in that we say we are not there to win a war , we are there to build an afghan state , an afghan army , an afghan police force , this would be welcome , because the people in europe want their soldiers home .
most public opinion polls in europe show that the majority of people want their soldiers back as soon as possible .
so if you devise a strategy that will bring your troops home - which is what president obama has announced - and you show that this is a crisis management and state-building operation that involves the united nations to a larger degree , that will get much more support in europe .
there has been a lot of debate in the past years whether or not the west should talk to the taliban .
what is your opinion ?
my sense is that there is more or less a consensus now in europe , and i think also in the united states , that there is a need for a political process .
you can speak about talking to taliban in two ways : one is to say we are talking with the good taliban .
we would then be dividing the taliban leadership by talking to local leaders and this would be a kind of counterinsurgency strategy .
this was used in iraq .
but the essential problem is that the taliban leadership will still be there and will still have a lot of support in some areas of the country and it will still be able to make war and create enormous difficulties to the international coalition . the other is to start communication at the highest level of the taliban in afghanistan .
but if you -lrb- do that , -rrb- the biggest difficulty is to decide what we want from them .
are we prepared to have the taliban in power again in kabul ?
what would be the impact of that in international public opinion - but especially in europe and the united states ?
the role of president karzai is a very contentious issue , which came up again recently after he confirmed reports that he was regularly accepting large sums of cash from iran .
is karzai for europe and the us still the best option to lead afghanistan ?
so far he is the only option .
no one has found a better option for afghanistan up to now .
we know that the elections were not very transparent and that it is important now to establish legitimacy and credibility .
but karzai is in power now , the election results were accepted after lots of doubts , and the europeans and the americans as well as the international community are now working with him .
and he is a very skillfull politician with many connections in afghanistan and he knows the country well , so he can start the process of talking with the taliban .
so he certainly is and will be playing an important political role .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 17.11.2010 eu , imf head to ireland for bailout talks amid fears for future of euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure is growing on ireland to accept assistance an eu / imf mission will be arriving in ireland on thursday to discuss a potential bailout of the severely indebted country .
the former celtic tiger , meanwhile , insists it does n't need to be rescued . europe edged closer to its second bailout of a eurozone state on wednesday , as the bloc 's finance ministers announced a joint mission with the imf to ireland directed at stepping up talks on its devastated banking sector .
" the situation is very pressing and very , very serious and we do n't have any time to waste , " eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters after meetings in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they are talks , not bailout negotiations : lenihan " it is essential that confidence in the irish banking sector is restored for the sake of financial stability in europe and for the sake of restoring confidence in the economy . "
irish finance minister brian lenihan confirmed that the emergency talks would begin in dublin on thursday but issued no details on what shape the bailout could take or its possible size .
" we have agreed to look at the structural problems in the irish banks in the light of recent market pressures and assess what needs to be done because banking questions are technical and difficult , " lenihan told irish state radio on wednesday .
dublin reluctant to become ' europe 's lackey ' according to an article published in the wall street journal on wednesday , the irish banking sector is up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering for themselves .
investors fear the final figure could be even higher given rising mortgage arrears , deposit outflows and higher funding costs .
nevertheless , irish leaders continue to refuse that neither the country nor its banks are in need of a bailout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish do n't want to beg like the orphan , oliver twist " what we want to concentrate on now is in a focused way , over coming days , to sit down and see in what way can assistance be provided to ensure that these issues can be dealt with properly and appropriately , " prime minister brian cowen told parliament on wednesday after news of thursday 's emergency talks had emerged .
" there has been no question of the government -lsb- being -rsb- in a negotiation for a bailout , " he said , dismissing the term as pejorative and referring to the fact that the state of ireland is pre-funded until the middle of next year .
meanwhile , the irish people share their prime minister 's resistance to financial assistance from brussels or anywhere else ; in the streets of the irish capital , a european bailout would be a downright " humiliation . "
sean , a 54-year-old , called it " the final insult to the good and decent people of this country , to go like a beggar in brussels and ask that very seasonal question - please sir , can i have some more ? " referring to the charles dickens character oliver twist .
another dubliner , adam , 42 , said it would be " the end of the independent irish republic . "
" i would rather be poor and free than a poor lackey of europe .
it 's time to stand up and be irish once again , " he added .
more eu members to require assistance ?
also on wednesday , eu finance ministers pledged to agree on stricter debt rules by mid-2011 , as well as on a new rescue fund for dangerously indebted countries such as greece - which received substantial eu funds earlier this year to avoid bankruptcy - and a number of other eurozone members .

" if we do n't survive with the eurozone we will not survive with the european union , " european council president herman von rompuy said .

dw 's bernd riegert believes ireland should accept aid - fast . the longer you wait , the more costly it gets .
in view of its rampant national debt and heavily indebted banks , ireland will have to accept help from the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
it is only a matter of days , maybe hours .
the eu finance ministers ' plans are ready , but ireland has so far steadfastly resisted applying for a state bailout .
this is a case of misplaced pride on the part of the country 's stricken prime minister , brian cowen .
the former celtic tiger is about to be skinned . cowen did not want to take responsibility for such action in front of his shaken voters .
he also fears the strict conditions that loans entail .
ireland would probably have to raise its extremely low corporate taxes and aggravate the economic crisis further still . every day of hesitation forces the cost of loans on the financial markets to skyrocket , while share prices drop . ireland 's finance minister has finally admitted that the problems seem to have become too big for the small country .
the crisis does not only affect ireland , it affects all of europe .
after all , the european central bank has tirelessly been pumping money into the irish budget , where it buys government bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoid a chain reaction ireland is as good as bankrupt and the eu 's larger member states , including britain that does not have the euro as its currency , will have to help the nation in order to protect their own interests .
ireland is indebted for the most part to britain , germany , the us and france .
an irish insolvency would hit the banks in europe : for instance germany 's state-run hre bank .
it is clearly in europe 's own interest to save ireland - the sooner , the better .
a chain reaction might still be averted , although portugal and possibly spain also stand on the edge of a precipice .
that is what european council president herman van rompuy must have had in mind when he said that the 16 states of the eurozone and the entire eu are fighting for survival .
it is alarming that the financial markets are reacting with a drop in the price of government bonds to chancellor angela merkel 's remarks that private investors should share the costs of state insolvencies after 2013 . debtors want to make money , but they do n't want to carry the risks , and that has to stop .
however , financial markets and investors currently still have the upper hand .
they act and politics is forced to react by using taxpayers ' money to buy time for bankrupt states .
in essence , that is what the bailout is : a safety net .
whether this structure will manage to stabilize the european currency and the financial system remains to be seen .
we are in the midst of a huge experiment .
in the case of greece , 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- were pledged and about 40 billion have been paid .
the next installment ca n't be made because the country has n't completely fulfilled its obligations .
the next crisis is already on the horizon .
the safety net is beginning to tear .

many countries use similar warning systems , first developed in the us . terror alert levels reflect the existing threat of an imminent terrorist attack , though such danger can hardly be measured .
the us department of homeland security developed such an advisory system following the september 11 attacks .
authorities raise the threat level to " high " - or in the worst case " severe " - if they receive pertinent information from their own intelligence service or other security authorities .
they also rely on intelligence data from other countries they work closely with .
this can involve tapped conversations , respective information in the internet or credible leads from informants in the jihadist scene .
it is very rarely based on a concrete lead .
members of german intelligence services recently questioned islamists in afghanistan for an entire week about terror scenarios in germany and europe .
according to security authorities , some 40 islamists from germany are currently residing in pakistan and afghanistan .
at the same time , around 200 specialists from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- have continued to work on verifying whether the latest terror warnings from the us are true .
this includes intensifying the surveillance of some 130 so-called " endangerers " living in germany .
various degrees of security measures normally , a collection of several indicators form a qualitative new threat situation .
this can result in a concrete terror alert officially announced to the public , in turn generally leading to increased controls at critical points in a country 's security structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere said new , tangible intelligence has come to light in germany , the federal interior minister and his counterparts in the individual states are responsible for this move .
the scope of possible measures to resort to range from ordering increased passenger and luggage controls at airports , monitoring train stations and major road junctions to temporarily closing embassies at particularly vulnerable locations .
in the united states , the government set up the five-tiered color-coded threat level system to protect against future accusations that security authorities did n't take information about the imminent 9/11 attacks seriously enough and inform the public .
germany 's interior minister thomas de maiziere probably had similar thoughts in his mind .
continual warnings last month , authorities discovered two us-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen , one of which went through cologne-bonn airport in western germany undetected .
it turned out that lufthansa had already tipped off the interior ministry about the terrorist threat from yemen .
the airline 's warning reportedly reached de maiziere already at the beginning of october - three weeks before the package bombs were found in europe .
in recent weeks , german media have also repeatedly reported on alleged imminent terrorist attacks in the us and europe .
in addition , there have been continual warnings by western intelligence services that terrorists could plan an attack still before christmas - though the al qaeda network has in the past liked to publicly spread such warnings for propaganda purposes .
other governments have also reacted with official terror warnings to the supposed changed security situation .
germany is the third eu nation after britain and france to announce such a warning to its population .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 17.11.2010 italy 's government hangs by a thread großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi 's days in politics appear to be numbered prime minister silvio berlusconi is confident of overcoming the latest political crisis in his government .
his survival will depend on what happens in confidence votes scheduled for early december . the latest italian drama began when deputy industry minister adolfo urso went on national television to announce he had resigned from prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right government , along with three other ministers .
" we propose a new government , a new majority , a new agenda for reform , " urso said .
" berlusconi is holing himself up in his palace like in a bunker . "
fed up with yet another berlusconi scandal involving young women and prostitutes , the leader 's former allies said they wanted to form a new center-right coalition with a new leader - one capable of addressing italy 's economic slowdown .
the four mps who resigned are supporters of parliamentary speaker gianfranco fini , a former ally of berlusconi turned rival .
they are part of fini 's new center-right splinter group called future and freedom .
for now , though , berlusconi remains in power - barely .
but barely has often been enough for italy 's richest man , who controls 90 percent of italian television and has vast holdings in newspapers and publishing companies .
he faces a confidence vote in both chambers of parliament on december 14 .
if he loses in either , he would be forced to resign and trigger early elections .
a strong grasp on power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finia was a neo-fascist turned mainstream conservative berlusconi said on wednesday he was confident he could win .
but most political experts expect him to be defeated in the lower house , where he no longer has a guaranteed majority since he split with fini last summer .
still , journalist christopher winner said it was unlikely berlusconi will go away without a ferocious political fight .
" it 's all about loyalty and the concept of betrayal ; it 's fairly straight-forward latin stuff , " said winner , the editor and italian political columnist for the rome-based the american magazine .
he added that despite berlusconi 's reputation as a corrupt buffoon outside italy , inside the country , the billionaire is still the most powerful person - and one who demands complete loyalty .
" he has tremendous power at almost every level of italian life , " winner said .
" it 's extremely possible that he 's warning some of the fini insiders that should they go through with their warning against him , they will pay in one way or another . "
population divided while support for berlusconi has weakened in parliament , italy 's population remains divided .
a poll published in the newspaper corriere della sera last weekend showed that 27 percent of italians said they 'd still vote for berlusconi 's people of freedom party .
it was followed by the center-left opposition democratic party at 24 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have ridiculed berlusconi in past protests for his supporters , berlusconi has made a positive difference , especially in his response to emergencies like the flooding in the north and the earthquake in l 'aquila .
they said he has helped italy navigate the financial crisis .
others feel the time has come for a change .
they have grown weary of his raucous private life , which has distracted him from the country 's real problems .
the beginning of the end winner said despite berlusconi 's power , his days in politics are likely numbered .
" this is the end of the cycle , it 's only a matter of time , " winner said about the 74-year-old .
" the only thing that berlusconi wanted was to get through this mandate .
this was the last time around .
what 's galling him is that is being denied him , the chance of seeing through this legislature as he did the previous one and it 's coming from within his own party , which is absolutely and utterly intolerable to him . "
meanwhile , on the same day as the confidence votes , italy 's constitutional court is due to rule on whether berlusconi has to face trial over charges that he bribed british lawyer david mills to give false testimony to protect his business interests .
but italians know not to write berlusconi off too soon .
he has bounced back before , surviving a string of sex scandals and corruption accusations .
the votes in december will show whether the time has come for him to finally leave italy 's political stage .

german economics minister rainer bruederle said wednesday 's cabinet decision meant that subsidies for coal-mining would be " irreversibly " ended in 2018 , which represented " good news for the german taxpayer . "
the government said it was scrapping a planned review of the closure of its remaining mines .
crash course the move , however , puts berlin on a collision course with the eu 's executive in brussels .
this summer , the european commission proposed that all subsidies to unprofitable coal mines be scrapped by 2014 , arguing that the payments were bad for the environment and contravened eu competition regulations .
in response , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet argued that an existing accord between the industry and the german government - foreseeing the 2018 closure - should be respected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle : ' 2018 is lights out for coal in germany ' germany was left lobbying for support from other eu states to overturn the proposal , which will be discussed by eu officials at a meeting in brussels on december 10 .
sources close to merkel 's government indicate that 23 other eu member states are in agreement with the german stance , with only sweden , denmark and the netherlands in favor of the commission 's plans .
the german coal industry employs around 25,000 people , mostly at mines in the country 's former industrial heartland in the west and southwest of the country .
without subsidies , expensive extraction methods make it impossible for german coal to compete on the international market .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 17.11.2010 european e-commerce struggles to cross borders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans increasingly embrace e-commerce european consumers are showing more interest in buying goods online from other nations , and more retailers want to sell their wares across borders , too .
but plenty of hurdles still hinder e-commerce in europe . e-commerce is taking off domestically in many european countries , including germany .
but few companies in the region have ventured beyond their home markets to sell their products via the internet to consumers in other countries .
a patchwork of rules regulating consumer transactions across europe continues to inhibit many retailers from selling abroad .
and , unfortunately , a quick fix is not in sight .
" more than two thirds of retailers in -lrb- germany -rrb- say they do n't use the internet to sell abroad largely because they are unfamiliar with the legal situation in the various countries , " nikolaus lindner , a legal expert at the german subsidiary of ebay , told deutsche welle .
widening gap germany is hardly alone .
the gap between domestic and international e-commerce across the eu is widening as a result of cross-border barriers to online trade , according to the european commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebay is among the companies calling for harmonized rules and regulations from 2006 to 2008 , the share of all eu consumers who bought at least one item domestically over the internet increased from 27 percent to 33 percent , while cross-border e-commerce rose only marginally from 6 percent to 7 percent .
yet demand for cross-border service exists : one third of all eu citizens indicate they would consider buying a product from another member state via the internet because it 's cheaper or better or not available in their home country .
consumers and retailers hope the european commission 's proposed consumer rights directive will help clear the way for cross-border e-commerce .
the directive tackles , among other things , the prickly issue of legal fragmentation in areas such as product returns , guarantees and intellectual property rights as well as rules for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste .
big roadblock missing in this lineup , however , is value-added tax , which can vary widely from state to state .
many retailers see it as a significant obstacle to selling abroad .
the problem is , such taxes are a member-state issue , still outside the scope of eu legislation .
ebay 's lindner argues retailers would be much more willing to engage in cross-border selling if the risks of failing to comply with various national regulations could be eliminated through rules at the eu-level .
the cost of fragmentation , he says , is a heavy burden on business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission hopes to harmonize laws to boost e-commerce for many , full harmonization is the ultimate goal .
but it 's proving to be a true tug-of-war .
harmonization is among the most debated issues in both european parliament sessions and meetings of representatives of national ministries in the european council .
many parliament members see a form of " targeted harmonization " as the way forward .
" the problem is consumer protection rules have not been developed across europe in any organized fashion but in a completely uncoordinated way , " said andreas schwab , a member of the european parliament .
" you ca n't put into a policy paper that you will always take the highest level consumer protection from all states because that creates a problem . "
finland is a case in point , according to schwab .
currently , the minimum warranty period across europe is two and a half years but in the nordic country it 's 10 .
" this is costly and there is really no proof that a warranty that long is really helpful , " schwab told deutsche welle .
" but the finnish say ' this is our law and we wo n't sacrifice it for europe . " '
completely uncoordinated even consumer protection commissioner meglena kuneva , a big supporter of harmonization , acknowledges that the highest level of consumer protection does n't necessarily guarantee an optimal solution for consumers – especially if they end up footing the bill .
schwab expects eu members will initially find agreement in a few selected areas , such as return rights .
policymakers hope to reach some kind of consensus next month to move ahead with legislation early next year , but it 's unclear what they will achieve .
" we will move where we can and wait for proposals to bring the other areas in line later , " he said .
for those retailers unwilling to wait until rules and regulations are harmonized across europe , andreas duscha with the e-commerce center-handel in cologne recommended seeking legal support to be on the safe side .
" we urge retailers to work closely with lawyers and not just download some forms from the internet and draw up their own terms and conditions , " he told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 17.11.2010 the pilgrimage to mecca : the hajj großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaaba at the holy mosque in mecca the hajj is the religious highlight of muslim life .
its order of events is predetermined in detail .
with about 2 million pilgrims visiting the holy sites of mecca within a few days , organizers have their hands full . it 's hot , it 's packed , and it may even be dangerous .
within a few days , about 2 million pilgrims visit the holy sites of mecca - a logistic feat that makes even the olympics or the soccer world cup look like a cakewalk . almost simultaneously , millions of pilgrims touch down at the airport in the nearby town of jeddah .
some 4,000 shuttle buses are in action .
desalination plants are working full blast in order to turn 130 million liters of water from the red sea into drinking water .
the hungry visitors devour 2 million loaves of bread every day .
and all that at temperatures near 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit , -rrb- even though it is in the middle of november .
the biggest problem , however , is security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia 's capital riad , harbor city jeddah , and the holy city of mecca about 100,000 security forces try to cope with the masses of believers .
they watch over a territory that spans 25 kilometers -lrb- 15 miles -rrb- from west to east .
the most dangerous spot is jamarat bridge .
until a few years ago , hundreds of thousands of people , moving in different directions , crowded through the very confined space there .
often , there were mass panics with hundreds of people dying .
in 2006 , almost 400 people died in the turmoil .
but today the pilgrims ' routes no longer cross there , since the former bridge has been turned into a five-story building with a one-way system on multiple levels , including escape routes .
a large part of the planning was done by german engineers .
despite the strains , the hajj is mandatory for all pious muslims who are healthy enough and can afford to go .
why ?
because it is one of the five basic duties of islam , just like fasting during ramadan , and daily prayers .
those who have already performed the hajj may call themselves a hajji .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hajj is one of the basic duties of islam the hajj goes back to the prophet muhammad who made his pilgrimage to mecca in 632 .
it always starts on the same day of the year : the eighth day of the last month of the islamic lunar calendar , the so-called hijri calendar .
the order of events is predetermined in every detail .
the most important stages are : day 1 stage 1 : getting ready arriving in mecca , pilgrims prepare for the hajj both inwardly and outwardly by entering what is called the " state of consecration . "
men put on the pilgrim 's garment comprised of two white unlined cloths .
from now on , they are not allowed to shave , comb their hair , or cut their hair and nails .
women are not allowed to cover their faces with veils .
stage 2 : the holy mosque bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of pilgrims at mecca 's holy mosque after entering the state of consecration , pilgrims head towards the holy mosque , the al-haram mosque .
right in the middle of it , there 's the kaaba .
it 's a brick-built cube with 12 x 10 meters of floor space ; it is 14 meters high .
during the pilgrimage season , the kaaba is decorated with a black curtain made from silk .
a koranic verse is embroidered on it with golden threads .
the kaaba is the geographic center of islam : muslims turn towards it when they pray .
according to religious tradition , adam built the kaaba .
it was destroyed by the flood , but abraham and his son ishmael rebuilt it .
in a corner of the kaaba there is a black stone .
supposedly , abraham received it as a gift from archangel gabriel .
the silver-edged stone is as big as a human hand .
experts still argue about whether the stone is a meteorite from outer space or if it 's actually made of earthly material such as glass .
pilgrims walk around the black stone seven times counter- clockwise .
whoever gets close enough to the kaaba , despite the masses , may kiss it .
stage 3 : departure to mina after having circled the kaaba seven times , muslims head towards the nearby town of mina .
there they 'll find prepared tents for the pilgrims to spend the night .
day 2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain of forgiveness stage 4 : mount arafat starting from mina , the journey continues to mount arafat , 25 kilometers east of mecca .
it 's believed to be a mountain of forgiveness .
this stage is among the most emotional parts of the hajj .
pilgrims spend a whole day praying and contemplating .
they ask god for forgiveness for their sins .
stage 5 : departure to muzdalifah in the evening , pilgrims walk to the holy valley of muzdalifah .
here they collect stones that they will need for the symbolic stoning of the devil during the next stage .
pilgrims also spend their second night there .
day 3 stage 6 : return to mina and stoning of the devil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial picture of jamarat bridge pilgrims return to mina even before sunrise .
they make their way to jamarat bridge – with the term " bridge " to be taken loosely .
in fact , it 's a highly complex five-story building with various ramps and towers .
three pillars stand out of it and symbolize the devil .
the pilgrims throw their collected stones from muzdalifah at the largest of the three pillars .
this is how they symbolically stone the devil .
stage 7 : the feast of sacrifice every pilgrim with enough money to do so buys a sheep or a goat and butchers it on the same day .
this means that hundreds of thousands of animals are killed within few hours .
pilgrims donate most of the sacrificed animals to the needy .
the feast of sacrifice is among the most important islamic feasts and it is celebrated by believers all around the world .
stage 8 : lifting the state of consecration the pilgrims may leave the state of consecration now , by symbolically having their hair cut .
women only have a strand of their hair made shorter .
all pilgrims may also put on their everyday clothes again .
stage 9 : return to mecca once more , the pilgrims return to the holy mosque in mecca and circle the kaaba seven times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the covered walkway between the hills safa and marwa stage 10 : the " running " between the hills safa and marwa , pilgrims now walk back and forth seven times .
they are thereby reviving a biblical scene of the old testament , when abraham 's wife hagar was desperately looking for water to prevent her son from dying of thirst .
finally an angel came to her help and showed her the way to the rescuing fountain zamzam .
stage 11 : return to mina all pilgrims return to their tents in mina .
day 4 -6 stage 12 : stoning of the devil in mina in the following days , pilgrims stay in mina and perform other symbolic stonings of the devil .
stage 13 : farewell to mecca to finish the hajj , pilgrims circle the kaaba seven times for a last time .

its order of events is predetermined in detail .
with about 2 million pilgrims visiting the holy sites of mecca within a few days , organizers have their hands full . it 's hot , it 's packed , and it may even be dangerous .
within a few days , about 2 million pilgrims visit the holy sites of mecca - a logistic feat that makes even the olympics or the soccer world cup look like a cakewalk . almost simultaneously , millions of pilgrims touch down at the airport in the nearby town of jeddah .
some 4,000 shuttle buses are in action .
desalination plants are working full blast in order to turn 130 million liters of water from the red sea into drinking water .
the hungry visitors devour 2 million loaves of bread every day .
and all that at temperatures near 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit , -rrb- even though it is in the middle of november .
the biggest problem , however , is security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia 's capital riad , harbor city jeddah , and the holy city of mecca about 100,000 security forces try to cope with the masses of believers .
they watch over a territory that spans 25 kilometers -lrb- 15 miles -rrb- from west to east .
the most dangerous spot is jamarat bridge .
until a few years ago , hundreds of thousands of people , moving in different directions , crowded through the very confined space there .
often , there were mass panics with hundreds of people dying .
in 2006 , almost 400 people died in the turmoil .
but today the pilgrims ' routes no longer cross there , since the former bridge has been turned into a five-story building with a one-way system on multiple levels , including escape routes .
a large part of the planning was done by german engineers .
despite the strains , the hajj is mandatory for all pious muslims who are healthy enough and can afford to go .
why ?
because it is one of the five basic duties of islam , just like fasting during ramadan , and daily prayers .
those who have already performed the hajj may call themselves a hajji .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hajj is one of the basic duties of islam the hajj goes back to the prophet muhammad who made his pilgrimage to mecca in 632 .
it always starts on the same day of the year : the eighth day of the last month of the islamic lunar calendar , the so-called hijri calendar .
the order of events is predetermined in every detail .
the most important stages are : day 1 stage 1 : getting ready arriving in mecca , pilgrims prepare for the hajj both inwardly and outwardly by entering what is called the " state of consecration . "
men put on the pilgrim 's garment comprised of two white unlined cloths .
from now on , they are not allowed to shave , comb their hair , or cut their hair and nails .
women are not allowed to cover their faces with veils .
stage 2 : the holy mosque bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of pilgrims at mecca 's holy mosque after entering the state of consecration , pilgrims head towards the holy mosque , the al-haram mosque .
right in the middle of it , there 's the kaaba .
it 's a brick-built cube with 12 x 10 meters of floor space ; it is 14 meters high .
during the pilgrimage season , the kaaba is decorated with a black curtain made from silk .
a koranic verse is embroidered on it with golden threads .
the kaaba is the geographic center of islam : muslims turn towards it when they pray .
according to religious tradition , adam built the kaaba .
it was destroyed by the flood , but abraham and his son ishmael rebuilt it .
in a corner of the kaaba there is a black stone .
supposedly , abraham received it as a gift from archangel gabriel .
the silver-edged stone is as big as a human hand .
experts still argue about whether the stone is a meteorite from outer space or if it 's actually made of earthly material such as glass .
pilgrims walk around the black stone seven times counter- clockwise .
whoever gets close enough to the kaaba , despite the masses , may kiss it .
stage 3 : departure to mina after having circled the kaaba seven times , muslims head towards the nearby town of mina .
there they 'll find prepared tents for the pilgrims to spend the night .
day 2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain of forgiveness stage 4 : mount arafat starting from mina , the journey continues to mount arafat , 25 kilometers east of mecca .
it 's believed to be a mountain of forgiveness .
this stage is among the most emotional parts of the hajj .
pilgrims spend a whole day praying and contemplating .
they ask god for forgiveness for their sins .
stage 5 : departure to muzdalifah in the evening , pilgrims walk to the holy valley of muzdalifah .
here they collect stones that they will need for the symbolic stoning of the devil during the next stage .
pilgrims also spend their second night there .
day 3 stage 6 : return to mina and stoning of the devil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial picture of jamarat bridge pilgrims return to mina even before sunrise .
they make their way to jamarat bridge – with the term " bridge " to be taken loosely .
in fact , it 's a highly complex five-story building with various ramps and towers .
three pillars stand out of it and symbolize the devil .
the pilgrims throw their collected stones from muzdalifah at the largest of the three pillars .
this is how they symbolically stone the devil .
stage 7 : the feast of sacrifice every pilgrim with enough money to do so buys a sheep or a goat and butchers it on the same day .
this means that hundreds of thousands of animals are killed within few hours .
pilgrims donate most of the sacrificed animals to the needy .
the feast of sacrifice is among the most important islamic feasts and it is celebrated by believers all around the world .
stage 8 : lifting the state of consecration the pilgrims may leave the state of consecration now , by symbolically having their hair cut .
women only have a strand of their hair made shorter .
all pilgrims may also put on their everyday clothes again .
stage 9 : return to mecca once more , the pilgrims return to the holy mosque in mecca and circle the kaaba seven times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the covered walkway between the hills safa and marwa stage 10 : the " running " between the hills safa and marwa , pilgrims now walk back and forth seven times .
they are thereby reviving a biblical scene of the old testament , when abraham 's wife hagar was desperately looking for water to prevent her son from dying of thirst .
finally an angel came to her help and showed her the way to the rescuing fountain zamzam .
stage 11 : return to mina all pilgrims return to their tents in mina .
day 4 -6 stage 12 : stoning of the devil in mina in the following days , pilgrims stay in mina and perform other symbolic stonings of the devil .
stage 13 : farewell to mecca to finish the hajj , pilgrims circle the kaaba seven times for a last time .

but plenty of hurdles still hinder e-commerce in europe . e-commerce is taking off domestically in many european countries , including germany .
but few companies in the region have ventured beyond their home markets to sell their products via the internet to consumers in other countries .
a patchwork of rules regulating consumer transactions across europe continues to inhibit many retailers from selling abroad .
and , unfortunately , a quick fix is not in sight .
" more than two thirds of retailers in -lrb- germany -rrb- say they do n't use the internet to sell abroad largely because they are unfamiliar with the legal situation in the various countries , " nikolaus lindner , a legal expert at the german subsidiary of ebay , told deutsche welle .
widening gap germany is hardly alone .
the gap between domestic and international e-commerce across the eu is widening as a result of cross-border barriers to online trade , according to the european commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebay is among the companies calling for harmonized rules and regulations from 2006 to 2008 , the share of all eu consumers who bought at least one item domestically over the internet increased from 27 percent to 33 percent , while cross-border e-commerce rose only marginally from 6 percent to 7 percent .
yet demand for cross-border service exists : one third of all eu citizens indicate they would consider buying a product from another member state via the internet because it 's cheaper or better or not available in their home country .
consumers and retailers hope the european commission 's proposed consumer rights directive will help clear the way for cross-border e-commerce .
the directive tackles , among other things , the prickly issue of legal fragmentation in areas such as product returns , guarantees and intellectual property rights as well as rules for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste .
big roadblock missing in this lineup , however , is value-added tax , which can vary widely from state to state .
many retailers see it as a significant obstacle to selling abroad .
the problem is , such taxes are a member-state issue , still outside the scope of eu legislation .
ebay 's lindner argues retailers would be much more willing to engage in cross-border selling if the risks of failing to comply with various national regulations could be eliminated through rules at the eu-level .
the cost of fragmentation , he says , is a heavy burden on business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission hopes to harmonize laws to boost e-commerce for many , full harmonization is the ultimate goal .
but it 's proving to be a true tug-of-war .
harmonization is among the most debated issues in both european parliament sessions and meetings of representatives of national ministries in the european council .
many parliament members see a form of " targeted harmonization " as the way forward .
" the problem is consumer protection rules have not been developed across europe in any organized fashion but in a completely uncoordinated way , " said andreas schwab , a member of the european parliament .
" you ca n't put into a policy paper that you will always take the highest level consumer protection from all states because that creates a problem . "
finland is a case in point , according to schwab .
currently , the minimum warranty period across europe is two and a half years but in the nordic country it 's 10 .
" this is costly and there is really no proof that a warranty that long is really helpful , " schwab told deutsche welle .
" but the finnish say ' this is our law and we wo n't sacrifice it for europe . " '
completely uncoordinated even consumer protection commissioner meglena kuneva , a big supporter of harmonization , acknowledges that the highest level of consumer protection does n't necessarily guarantee an optimal solution for consumers – especially if they end up footing the bill .
schwab expects eu members will initially find agreement in a few selected areas , such as return rights .
policymakers hope to reach some kind of consensus next month to move ahead with legislation early next year , but it 's unclear what they will achieve .
" we will move where we can and wait for proposals to bring the other areas in line later , " he said .
for those retailers unwilling to wait until rules and regulations are harmonized across europe , andreas duscha with the e-commerce center-handel in cologne recommended seeking legal support to be on the safe side .
" we urge retailers to work closely with lawyers and not just download some forms from the internet and draw up their own terms and conditions , " he told deutsche welle .

but the chief of the german central bank says banks should prepare for changes now . if there 's one thing the bankers and regulators gathered at the euro finance week in frankfurt agree on , it is that reform on a national level alone wo n't do much to stabilize the financial industry .
instead , they say that loopholes need to be plugged on an international level .
the german-centric economic forum started on monday , and there has been little doubt among attendees that action should be taken even before the stricter capital requirements of basel iii take effect in 2013 .
financial systems should be made more stable and resilient , they say .
german central bank president axel weber singled out german public-sector banks in his remarks .
" i believe , particularly in this sector , that the mikado-strategy that 's been pursued so far is leading nowhere , " weber said .
two such banks – bayernlb and westlb – recently failed in a merger attempt after receiving billions of taxpayer euros during the crisis .
the european commission set a new deadline of february 2011 for westlb to come up with ideas of how to sustain itself in the long term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels has given westlb a three-month deadline for restructuring weber said banks should n't be sluggish about making changes , and that they need to be proactive in preparing for coming regulations .
" changes will be coming to the market structure , " he said .
" there will be further changes .
the profiles of the actors will change , and the type and scope of the banking business will be affected .
" the refinancing structure of the banking system will change .
eventually there will also be less actors .
several will drop out – those which can not meet these new capital requirements . "
bankers have often complained about having to carry the high costs of the new regulations , but weber said that " a more stable financial system is worth the price . "
risks to international competition deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann spoke out against the notion of additional capital requirements for banks in germany , saying international competition is a concern .
what is needed is a method in which " banks which are a burden for the system – and therefore also taxpayers – can be eliminated , " he said .
" when you go to singapore , hong kong or shanghai today , then you experience what 's meant by location competition , " he said .
" and i believe we should always consider here what options we have to make the entire system more robust above all , but without giving up location advantages or tolerating location disadvantages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's ackermann defended big banking ackermann also defended large banking from skeptics who say banks were granted bailouts specifically because they had become too large to be allowed to fail .
" it is absolutely necessary that we define ourselves beyond national boundaries , " he said .
on monday a panel of economic journalists named ackermann ' european banker of the year ' for successfully leading his institution through the financial crisis .
asian banks ' ready ' according to wolfgang kirsch , ceo of dz bank , germany 's central cooperative bank , asian competitors are now primed and ready .
" after the asian crisis – this rough treatment which , in part , we 've been experiencing these days – this was something asian banks went through , " he said .
" and today they can happily call out , ' basel iii is n't an issue for us . '
anyone who says basel iii is n't an issue clearly has his own capital and liquidity .
and both of those things want to be utilized .
so we should keep an eye on that . "
the german central bank 's weber , however , foresees the need for regulation beyond just the banking system .
he said financial groups funneled billions of euros past regulators , agitating the financial crisis .
" we need to cast light into the shadows of the banking system , " he said .

among other things , vasconcelos addressed the outlook for european engagement in afghanistan .
deutsche welle : the war in afghanistan is now in its ninth year and the original goal of establishing a democracy there is all but gone .
europeans have been deeply skeptical of the afghan mission for a long time .
could europe do more in afghanistan ?
alvaro de vasconcelos : we can do more .
but to do more we should do it in a civilian way .
we are going to have the nato summit in a few days and the temptation will be to say the civilian training in afghanistan must be done by nato itself because the europeans are not doing as much as necessary and the americans will essentially work through nato .
i think this is as mistake .
because this will make civilians become part of a military operation .
we need to delink the civilian from the military .
of course the military is needed to guarantee the protection of the civilian training .
but we need to train the police in a different way then we train the military .
the police are trained to protect people , so we need to move toward this core aspect - human security and strategy where the main objective is to protect the civilians in afghanistan and not to kill the enemy .
because as president obama from day one said we should not be in afghanistan to kill civilians , but to protect them .
do you think europeans would support sending more police trainers to afghanistan ?
i think if there is a clear shift in the strategy in afghanistan in that we say we are not there to win a war , we are there to build an afghan state , an afghan army , an afghan police force , this would be welcome , because the people in europe want their soldiers home .
most public opinion polls in europe show that the majority of people want their soldiers back as soon as possible .
so if you devise a strategy that will bring your troops home - which is what president obama has announced - and you show that this is a crisis management and state-building operation that involves the united nations to a larger degree , that will get much more support in europe .
there has been a lot of debate in the past years whether or not the west should talk to the taliban .
what is your opinion ?
my sense is that there is more or less a consensus now in europe , and i think also in the united states , that there is a need for a political process .
you can speak about talking to taliban in two ways : one is to say we are talking with the good taliban .
we would then be dividing the taliban leadership by talking to local leaders and this would be a kind of counterinsurgency strategy .
this was used in iraq .
but the essential problem is that the taliban leadership will still be there and will still have a lot of support in some areas of the country and it will still be able to make war and create enormous difficulties to the international coalition . the other is to start communication at the highest level of the taliban in afghanistan .
but if you -lrb- do that , -rrb- the biggest difficulty is to decide what we want from them .
are we prepared to have the taliban in power again in kabul ?
what would be the impact of that in international public opinion - but especially in europe and the united states ?
the role of president karzai is a very contentious issue , which came up again recently after he confirmed reports that he was regularly accepting large sums of cash from iran .
is karzai for europe and the us still the best option to lead afghanistan ?
so far he is the only option .
no one has found a better option for afghanistan up to now .
we know that the elections were not very transparent and that it is important now to establish legitimacy and credibility .
but karzai is in power now , the election results were accepted after lots of doubts , and the europeans and the americans as well as the international community are now working with him .
and he is a very skillfull politician with many connections in afghanistan and he knows the country well , so he can start the process of talking with the taliban .
so he certainly is and will be playing an important political role .

this power play has caused poland many headaches .
but new know-how in gas production could mark a turn in events . practically every winter , russia and its neighbors ukraine and belarus disagree on gas supply technicalities .
this dispute has endangered deliveries to poland .
the baltic sea pipeline , which will connect western european markets with major russian gas fields , has made matters worse .
warsaw 's politicians feel they will be at moscow 's mercy because russia can then shut off the supply without endangering its deliveries to germany .
but this headache could soon be over .
the largest deposits of shale gas in europe are assumed to be located on polish territory .
new technology from the united states could make it possible to exploit these gas reserves .
test drillings are planned all across the country .
according to geologists , poland could become the largest gas supplier in europe after norway and russia .
it would make the eastern european country rich - much richer than previously assumed , said energy expert pawel nierada from the sobieski institute in warsaw .
" conservative estimates already show that poland could suddenly become a serious exporter on the european gas market , " nierada said .
" the reserves exceed our country 's consumption many times over .
it 's hard to imagine what it would be like if the more optimistic estimates of the us government were to turn out to be true .
then , here in poland , we would have more gas than norway . "
skeptics question new technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland could soon control its own gas distribution natural gas which is produced in europe and asia has so far been relatively easy to access .
it lies in enormous bubbles under impermeable layers of earth , for example out of clay .
shale gas , on the other hand , is located in the middle of rock beds .
it 's nothing new that this valuable resource exists there .
but no one was ever interested in it before , because production was considered to be difficult and therefore uneconomical .
but that has changed .
in the united states , shale gas already covers 20 percent of gas consumption .
new technology used over the past few years has made this possible .
special drills first make their way into the ground vertically and then , when they reach the rock bed with the gas , bend into a horizontal position .
there , they pump a chemical liquid into the ground , which causes the rock bed to burst open .
the gas can then flow .
but many people are skeptical about this procedure , nierada said .
" there are also critical voices which say that the technology is still in its infancy - the experts from the russian gas company gazprom , for example , " he said .
" but in the united states , the production works .
and international firms believe it will be successful in poland , too .
otherwise , they would n't have already invested so much money in licenses and test drilling . "
the polish government has already issued some 60 licenses for test drillings , mainly to american companies .
it 's no wonder that this is cause for concern further to the east - in moscow .
after all , gas exports make up a significant part of russia 's gross domestic product .
they could stagnate or even decrease as a result of the polish finds .
gazprom has already admitted that it is n't able to sell as much to the united states as it used to because of the shale gas reserves there .
in a report , the company even said shale gas could " fundamentally change " the worldwide gas market .
us film highlights drawbacks us officials have billed shale gas a clean alternative , which could dominate the gas market by 2030 .
but despite its growing use there , shale gas extraction has caused controversy .
the hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , used to force out the gas has been a point of debate . earlier this year , the environmental protection agency asked gas companies to reveal what chemicals are used in deep extraction , addressing concerns by residents that the fracking had contaminated their drinking water . in the documentary " gasland , " which won the special jury prize at this year 's sundance film festival , filmmaker josh fox showed families in a drilling area whose tap water was even flammable . in addition , environmentalists have pointed out that the cleaner burning effects of shale gas were lessened when factoring in the energy expended to extract and transport it .
lack of political support production in poland could begin in ten years at the earliest , gas companies said .
but experts think it could start earlier .
then , the country could fulfill a dream it has had for hundreds of years : to be economically - and therefore also politically - independent from russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chevron is one of several us companies who have bought shale gas licenses in poland in spite of that , though , politicians across the spectrum have been slamming on the brakes , such as economics minister waldemar pawlak .
" up till now , shale gas has been more of a media phenomenon , " pawlak said .
" we still do n't know how difficult it will be to produce in poland .
it will also be more expensive than gas from conventional sources , because more drilling is necessary for the same amount of output . "
poland 's president bronislaw komorowski has been skeptical , too .
he said that all those production towers across the country would be an eyesore .
economic factors drive skepticism even if there are factual reasons for the skepticism , experts have long criticized polish politicians for being too passive .
for years , poland has relied on imports from russia without even considering the exploitation at least of conventional gas resources in the country .
this was mainly due to the monopoly of the state-owned gas firm pgnig .
" the company was never interested in producing gas itself , " nierada said .
" it earned its money very easily , after all , by buying gas from russia and simply adding its margin .
the company did n't care about how high the final price was . "
this passivity is now costing poland dearly .
in order to have enough gas for the coming winter , the state-owned company had to close a deal with gazprom for additional gas deliveries .
it even risked a battle with the eu commission , as brussels said russia was dictating unacceptable conditions .
the two sides finally reached an agreement at the end of october ensuring deliveries of russian natural gas until 2022 .
but such problems will possibly no longer exist in a few years - at least , not if poland turns into a european kuwait .

for years , poland has relied on imports from russia without even considering the exploitation at least of conventional gas resources in the country .
this was mainly due to the monopoly of the state-owned gas firm pgnig .
" the company was never interested in producing gas itself , " nierada said .
" it earned its money very easily , after all , by buying gas from russia and simply adding its margin .
the company did n't care about how high the final price was . "
this passivity is now costing poland dearly .
in order to have enough gas for the coming winter , the state-owned company had to close a deal with gazprom for additional gas deliveries .
it even risked a battle with the eu commission , as brussels said russia was dictating unacceptable conditions .
the two sides finally reached an agreement at the end of october ensuring deliveries of russian natural gas until 2022 .
but such problems will possibly no longer exist in a few years - at least , not if poland turns into a european kuwait .

the former celtic tiger , meanwhile , insists it does n't need to be rescued . europe edged closer to its second bailout of a eurozone state on wednesday , as the bloc 's finance ministers announced a joint mission with the imf to ireland directed at stepping up talks on its devastated banking sector .
" the situation is very pressing and very , very serious and we do n't have any time to waste , " eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters after meetings in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they are talks , not bailout negotiations : lenihan " it is essential that confidence in the irish banking sector is restored for the sake of financial stability in europe and for the sake of restoring confidence in the economy . "
irish finance minister brian lenihan confirmed that the emergency talks would begin in dublin on thursday but issued no details on what shape the bailout could take or its possible size .
" we have agreed to look at the structural problems in the irish banks in the light of recent market pressures and assess what needs to be done because banking questions are technical and difficult , " lenihan told irish state radio on wednesday .
dublin reluctant to become ' europe 's lackey ' according to an article published in the wall street journal on wednesday , the irish banking sector is up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering for themselves .
investors fear the final figure could be even higher given rising mortgage arrears , deposit outflows and higher funding costs .
nevertheless , irish leaders continue to refuse that neither the country nor its banks are in need of a bailout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish do n't want to beg like the orphan , oliver twist " what we want to concentrate on now is in a focused way , over coming days , to sit down and see in what way can assistance be provided to ensure that these issues can be dealt with properly and appropriately , " prime minister brian cowen told parliament on wednesday after news of thursday 's emergency talks had emerged .
" there has been no question of the government -lsb- being -rsb- in a negotiation for a bailout , " he said , dismissing the term as pejorative and referring to the fact that the state of ireland is pre-funded until the middle of next year .
meanwhile , the irish people share their prime minister 's resistance to financial assistance from brussels or anywhere else ; in the streets of the irish capital , a european bailout would be a downright " humiliation . "
sean , a 54-year-old , called it " the final insult to the good and decent people of this country , to go like a beggar in brussels and ask that very seasonal question - please sir , can i have some more ? " referring to the charles dickens character oliver twist .
another dubliner , adam , 42 , said it would be " the end of the independent irish republic . "
" i would rather be poor and free than a poor lackey of europe .
it 's time to stand up and be irish once again , " he added .
more eu members to require assistance ?
also on wednesday , eu finance ministers pledged to agree on stricter debt rules by mid-2011 , as well as on a new rescue fund for dangerously indebted countries such as greece - which received substantial eu funds earlier this year to avoid bankruptcy - and a number of other eurozone members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von rompuy : resolution of the crisis is critical for the eu portugal and spain , which are already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , have both alluded to budgetary difficulties .
as with ireland , however , there have been no requests for emergency funding as of yet .
but the ministers gave a clear signal that " determined and coordinated " action had to be taken to resolve the debt crisis that is threatening the future financial stability of europe and the 16-member , single-currency eurozone .
" if we do n't survive with the eurozone we will not survive with the european union , " european council president herman von rompuy said .

among other things , vasconcelos addressed the outlook for european engagement in afghanistan .
deutsche welle : the war in afghanistan is now in its ninth year and the original goal of establishing a democracy there is all but gone .
europeans have been deeply skeptical of the afghan mission for a long time .
could europe do more in afghanistan ?
alvaro de vasconcelos : we can do more .
but to do more we should do it in a civilian way .
we are going to have the nato summit in a few days and the temptation will be to say the civilian training in afghanistan must be done by nato itself because the europeans are not doing as much as necessary and the americans will essentially work through nato .
i think this is as mistake .
because this will make civilians become part of a military operation .
we need to delink the civilian from the military .
of course the military is needed to guarantee the protection of the civilian training .
but we need to train the police in a different way then we train the military .
the police are trained to protect people , so we need to move toward this core aspect - human security and strategy where the main objective is to protect the civilians in afghanistan and not to kill the enemy .
because as president obama from day one said we should not be in afghanistan to kill civilians , but to protect them .
do you think europeans would support sending more police trainers to afghanistan ?
i think if there is a clear shift in the strategy in afghanistan in that we say we are not there to win a war , we are there to build an afghan state , an afghan army , an afghan police force , this would be welcome , because the people in europe want their soldiers home .
most public opinion polls in europe show that the majority of people want their soldiers back as soon as possible .
so if you devise a strategy that will bring your troops home - which is what president obama has announced - and you show that this is a crisis management and state-building operation that involves the united nations to a larger degree , that will get much more support in europe .
there has been a lot of debate in the past years whether or not the west should talk to the taliban .
what is your opinion ?
my sense is that there is more or less a consensus now in europe , and i think also in the united states , that there is a need for a political process .
you can speak about talking to taliban in two ways : one is to say we are talking with the good taliban .
we would then be dividing the taliban leadership by talking to local leaders and this would be a kind of counterinsurgency strategy .
this was used in iraq .
but the essential problem is that the taliban leadership will still be there and will still have a lot of support in some areas of the country and it will still be able to make war and create enormous difficulties to the international coalition . the other is to start communication at the highest level of the taliban in afghanistan .
but if you -lrb- do that , -rrb- the biggest difficulty is to decide what we want from them .
are we prepared to have the taliban in power again in kabul ?
what would be the impact of that in international public opinion - but especially in europe and the united states ?
the role of president karzai is a very contentious issue , which came up again recently after he confirmed reports that he was regularly accepting large sums of cash from iran .
is karzai for europe and the us still the best option to lead afghanistan ?
so far he is the only option .
no one has found a better option for afghanistan up to now .
we know that the elections were not very transparent and that it is important now to establish legitimacy and credibility .
but karzai is in power now , the election results were accepted after lots of doubts , and the europeans and the americans as well as the international community are now working with him .
and he is a very skillfull politician with many connections in afghanistan and he knows the country well , so he can start the process of talking with the taliban .
so he certainly is and will be playing an important political role .

dw 's bernd riegert believes ireland should accept aid - fast . the longer you wait , the more costly it gets .
in view of its rampant national debt and heavily indebted banks , ireland will have to accept help from the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
it is only a matter of days , maybe hours .
the eu finance ministers ' plans are ready , but ireland has so far steadfastly resisted applying for a state bailout .
this is a case of misplaced pride on the part of the country 's stricken prime minister , brian cowen .
the former celtic tiger is about to be skinned . cowen did not want to take responsibility for such action in front of his shaken voters .
he also fears the strict conditions that loans entail .
ireland would probably have to raise its extremely low corporate taxes and aggravate the economic crisis further still . every day of hesitation forces the cost of loans on the financial markets to skyrocket , while share prices drop . ireland 's finance minister has finally admitted that the problems seem to have become too big for the small country .
the crisis does not only affect ireland , it affects all of europe .
after all , the european central bank has tirelessly been pumping money into the irish budget , where it buys government bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoid a chain reaction ireland is as good as bankrupt and the eu 's larger member states , including britain that does not have the euro as its currency , will have to help the nation in order to protect their own interests .
ireland is indebted for the most part to britain , germany , the us and france .
an irish insolvency would hit the banks in europe : for instance germany 's state-run hre bank .
it is clearly in europe 's own interest to save ireland - the sooner , the better .
a chain reaction might still be averted , although portugal and possibly spain also stand on the edge of a precipice .
that is what european council president herman van rompuy must have had in mind when he said that the 16 states of the eurozone and the entire eu are fighting for survival .
it is alarming that the financial markets are reacting with a drop in the price of government bonds to chancellor angela merkel 's remarks that private investors should share the costs of state insolvencies after 2013 . debtors want to make money , but they do n't want to carry the risks , and that has to stop .
however , financial markets and investors currently still have the upper hand .
they act and politics is forced to react by using taxpayers ' money to buy time for bankrupt states .
in essence , that is what the bailout is : a safety net .
whether this structure will manage to stabilize the european currency and the financial system remains to be seen .
we are in the midst of a huge experiment .
in the case of greece , 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- were pledged and about 40 billion have been paid .
the next installment ca n't be made because the country has n't completely fulfilled its obligations .
the next crisis is already on the horizon .
the safety net is beginning to tear .

this power play has caused poland many headaches .
but new know-how in gas production could mark a turn in events . practically every winter , russia and its neighbors ukraine and belarus disagree on gas supply technicalities .
this dispute has endangered deliveries to poland .
the baltic sea pipeline , which will connect western european markets with major russian gas fields , has made matters worse .
warsaw 's politicians feel they will be at moscow 's mercy because russia can then shut off the supply without endangering its deliveries to germany .
but this headache could soon be over .
the largest deposits of shale gas in europe are assumed to be located on polish territory .
new technology from the united states could make it possible to exploit these gas reserves .
test drillings are planned all across the country .
according to geologists , poland could become the largest gas supplier in europe after norway and russia .
it would make the eastern european country rich - much richer than previously assumed , said energy expert pawel nierada from the sobieski institute in warsaw .
" conservative estimates already show that poland could suddenly become a serious exporter on the european gas market , " nierada said .
" the reserves exceed our country 's consumption many times over .
it 's hard to imagine what it would be like if the more optimistic estimates of the us government were to turn out to be true .
then , here in poland , we would have more gas than norway . "
skeptics question new technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland could soon control its own gas distribution natural gas which is produced in europe and asia has so far been relatively easy to access .
it lies in enormous bubbles under impermeable layers of earth , for example out of clay .
shale gas , on the other hand , is located in the middle of rock beds .
it 's nothing new that this valuable resource exists there .
but no one was ever interested in it before , because production was considered to be difficult and therefore uneconomical .
but that has changed .
in the united states , shale gas already covers 20 percent of gas consumption .
new technology used over the past few years has made this possible .
special drills first make their way into the ground vertically and then , when they reach the rock bed with the gas , bend into a horizontal position .
there , they pump a chemical liquid into the ground , which causes the rock bed to burst open .
the gas can then flow .
but many people are skeptical about this procedure , nierada said .
" there are also critical voices which say that the technology is still in its infancy - the experts from the russian gas company gazprom , for example , " he said .
" but in the united states , the production works .
and international firms believe it will be successful in poland , too .
otherwise , they would n't have already invested so much money in licenses and test drilling . "
the polish government has already issued some 60 licenses for test drillings , mainly to american companies .
it 's no wonder that this is cause for concern further to the east - in moscow .
after all , gas exports make up a significant part of russia 's gross domestic product .
they could stagnate or even decrease as a result of the polish finds .
gazprom has already admitted that it is n't able to sell as much to the united states as it used to because of the shale gas reserves there .
in a report , the company even said shale gas could " fundamentally change " the worldwide gas market .
us film highlights drawbacks us officials have billed shale gas a clean alternative , which could dominate the gas market by 2030 .
but despite its growing use there , shale gas extraction has caused controversy .
the hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , used to force out the gas has been a point of debate . earlier this year , the environmental protection agency asked gas companies to reveal what chemicals are used in deep extraction , addressing concerns by residents that the fracking had contaminated their drinking water . in the documentary " gasland , " which won the special jury prize at this year 's sundance film festival , filmmaker josh fox showed families in a drilling area whose tap water was even flammable . in addition , environmentalists have pointed out that the cleaner burning effects of shale gas were lessened when factoring in the energy expended to extract and transport it .
lack of political support production in poland could begin in ten years at the earliest , gas companies said .
but experts think it could start earlier .
then , the country could fulfill a dream it has had for hundreds of years : to be economically - and therefore also politically - independent from russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chevron is one of several us companies who have bought shale gas licenses in poland in spite of that , though , politicians across the spectrum have been slamming on the brakes , such as economics minister waldemar pawlak .
" up till now , shale gas has been more of a media phenomenon , " pawlak said .
" we still do n't know how difficult it will be to produce in poland .
it will also be more expensive than gas from conventional sources , because more drilling is necessary for the same amount of output . "
poland 's president bronislaw komorowski has been skeptical , too .
he said that all those production towers across the country would be an eyesore .
economic factors drive skepticism even if there are factual reasons for the skepticism , experts have long criticized polish politicians for being too passive .
for years , poland has relied on imports from russia without even considering the exploitation at least of conventional gas resources in the country .
this was mainly due to the monopoly of the state-owned gas firm pgnig .
" the company was never interested in producing gas itself , " nierada said .
" it earned its money very easily , after all , by buying gas from russia and simply adding its margin .
the company did n't care about how high the final price was . "
this passivity is now costing poland dearly .
in order to have enough gas for the coming winter , the state-owned company had to close a deal with gazprom for additional gas deliveries .
it even risked a battle with the eu commission , as brussels said russia was dictating unacceptable conditions .
the two sides finally reached an agreement at the end of october ensuring deliveries of russian natural gas until 2022 .
but such problems will possibly no longer exist in a few years - at least , not if poland turns into a european kuwait .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 17.11.2010 terror alert levels reflect dangers difficult to verify großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are increasingly patrolling train stations and airports germany 's interior minister ordered increased security across the country after its terror alert showed a heightened threat of a terrorist attack .
many countries use similar warning systems , first developed in the us . terror alert levels reflect the existing threat of an imminent terrorist attack , though such danger can hardly be measured .
the us department of homeland security developed such an advisory system following the september 11 attacks .
authorities raise the threat level to " high " - or in the worst case " severe " - if they receive pertinent information from their own intelligence service or other security authorities .
they also rely on intelligence data from other countries they work closely with .
this can involve tapped conversations , respective information in the internet or credible leads from informants in the jihadist scene .
it is very rarely based on a concrete lead .
members of german intelligence services recently questioned islamists in afghanistan for an entire week about terror scenarios in germany and europe .
according to security authorities , some 40 islamists from germany are currently residing in pakistan and afghanistan .
at the same time , around 200 specialists from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- have continued to work on verifying whether the latest terror warnings from the us are true .
this includes intensifying the surveillance of some 130 so-called " endangerers " living in germany .
various degrees of security measures normally , a collection of several indicators form a qualitative new threat situation .
this can result in a concrete terror alert officially announced to the public , in turn generally leading to increased controls at critical points in a country 's security structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere said new , tangible intelligence has come to light in germany , the federal interior minister and his counterparts in the individual states are responsible for this move .
the scope of possible measures to resort to range from ordering increased passenger and luggage controls at airports , monitoring train stations and major road junctions to temporarily closing embassies at particularly vulnerable locations .
in the united states , the government set up the five-tiered color-coded threat level system to protect against future accusations that security authorities did n't take information about the imminent 9/11 attacks seriously enough and inform the public .
germany 's interior minister thomas de maiziere probably had similar thoughts in his mind .
continual warnings last month , authorities discovered two us-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen , one of which went through cologne-bonn airport in western germany undetected .
it turned out that lufthansa had already tipped off the interior ministry about the terrorist threat from yemen .
the airline 's warning reportedly reached de maiziere already at the beginning of october - three weeks before the package bombs were found in europe .
in recent weeks , german media have also repeatedly reported on alleged imminent terrorist attacks in the us and europe .
in addition , there have been continual warnings by western intelligence services that terrorists could plan an attack still before christmas - though the al qaeda network has in the past liked to publicly spread such warnings for propaganda purposes .
other governments have also reacted with official terror warnings to the supposed changed security situation .
germany is the third eu nation after britain and france to announce such a warning to its population .

dw 's bernd riegert believes ireland should accept aid - fast . the longer you wait , the more costly it gets .
in view of its rampant national debt and heavily indebted banks , ireland will have to accept help from the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
it is only a matter of days , maybe hours .
the eu finance ministers ' plans are ready , but ireland has so far steadfastly resisted applying for a state bailout .
this is a case of misplaced pride on the part of the country 's stricken prime minister , brian cowen .
the former celtic tiger is about to be skinned . cowen did not want to take responsibility for such action in front of his shaken voters .
he also fears the strict conditions that loans entail .
ireland would probably have to raise its extremely low corporate taxes and aggravate the economic crisis further still . every day of hesitation forces the cost of loans on the financial markets to skyrocket , while share prices drop . ireland 's finance minister has finally admitted that the problems seem to have become too big for the small country .
the crisis does not only affect ireland , it affects all of europe .
after all , the european central bank has tirelessly been pumping money into the irish budget , where it buys government bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoid a chain reaction ireland is as good as bankrupt and the eu 's larger member states , including britain that does not have the euro as its currency , will have to help the nation in order to protect their own interests .
ireland is indebted for the most part to britain , germany , the us and france .
an irish insolvency would hit the banks in europe : for instance germany 's state-run hre bank .
it is clearly in europe 's own interest to save ireland - the sooner , the better .
a chain reaction might still be averted , although portugal and possibly spain also stand on the edge of a precipice .
that is what european council president herman van rompuy must have had in mind when he said that the 16 states of the eurozone and the entire eu are fighting for survival .
it is alarming that the financial markets are reacting with a drop in the price of government bonds to chancellor angela merkel 's remarks that private investors should share the costs of state insolvencies after 2013 . debtors want to make money , but they do n't want to carry the risks , and that has to stop .
however , financial markets and investors currently still have the upper hand .
they act and politics is forced to react by using taxpayers ' money to buy time for bankrupt states .
in essence , that is what the bailout is : a safety net .
whether this structure will manage to stabilize the european currency and the financial system remains to be seen .
we are in the midst of a huge experiment .
in the case of greece , 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- were pledged and about 40 billion have been paid .
the next installment ca n't be made because the country has n't completely fulfilled its obligations .
the next crisis is already on the horizon .
the safety net is beginning to tear .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 17.11.2010 eu , imf head to ireland for bailout talks amid fears for future of euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure is growing on ireland to accept assistance an eu / imf mission will be arriving in ireland on thursday to discuss a potential bailout of the severely indebted country .
the former celtic tiger , meanwhile , insists it does n't need to be rescued . europe edged closer to its second bailout of a eurozone state on wednesday , as the bloc 's finance ministers announced a joint mission with the imf to ireland directed at stepping up talks on its devastated banking sector .
" the situation is very pressing and very , very serious and we do n't have any time to waste , " eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters after meetings in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they are talks , not bailout negotiations : lenihan " it is essential that confidence in the irish banking sector is restored for the sake of financial stability in europe and for the sake of restoring confidence in the economy . "
irish finance minister brian lenihan confirmed that the emergency talks would begin in dublin on thursday but issued no details on what shape the bailout could take or its possible size .
" we have agreed to look at the structural problems in the irish banks in the light of recent market pressures and assess what needs to be done because banking questions are technical and difficult , " lenihan told irish state radio on wednesday .
dublin reluctant to become ' europe 's lackey ' according to an article published in the wall street journal on wednesday , the irish banking sector is up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering for themselves .
investors fear the final figure could be even higher given rising mortgage arrears , deposit outflows and higher funding costs .
nevertheless , irish leaders continue to refuse that neither the country nor its banks are in need of a bailout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish do n't want to beg like the orphan , oliver twist " what we want to concentrate on now is in a focused way , over coming days , to sit down and see in what way can assistance be provided to ensure that these issues can be dealt with properly and appropriately , " prime minister brian cowen told parliament on wednesday after news of thursday 's emergency talks had emerged .
" there has been no question of the government -lsb- being -rsb- in a negotiation for a bailout , " he said , dismissing the term as pejorative and referring to the fact that the state of ireland is pre-funded until the middle of next year .
meanwhile , the irish people share their prime minister 's resistance to financial assistance from brussels or anywhere else ; in the streets of the irish capital , a european bailout would be a downright " humiliation . "
sean , a 54-year-old , called it " the final insult to the good and decent people of this country , to go like a beggar in brussels and ask that very seasonal question - please sir , can i have some more ? " referring to the charles dickens character oliver twist .
another dubliner , adam , 42 , said it would be " the end of the independent irish republic . "
" i would rather be poor and free than a poor lackey of europe .
it 's time to stand up and be irish once again , " he added .
more eu members to require assistance ?
also on wednesday , eu finance ministers pledged to agree on stricter debt rules by mid-2011 , as well as on a new rescue fund for dangerously indebted countries such as greece - which received substantial eu funds earlier this year to avoid bankruptcy - and a number of other eurozone members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von rompuy : resolution of the crisis is critical for the eu portugal and spain , which are already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , have both alluded to budgetary difficulties .
as with ireland , however , there have been no requests for emergency funding as of yet .
but the ministers gave a clear signal that " determined and coordinated " action had to be taken to resolve the debt crisis that is threatening the future financial stability of europe and the 16-member , single-currency eurozone .
" if we do n't survive with the eurozone we will not survive with the european union , " european council president herman von rompuy said .

among other things , vasconcelos addressed the outlook for european engagement in afghanistan .
deutsche welle : the war in afghanistan is now in its ninth year and the original goal of establishing a democracy there is all but gone .
europeans have been deeply skeptical of the afghan mission for a long time .
could europe do more in afghanistan ?
alvaro de vasconcelos : we can do more .
but to do more we should do it in a civilian way .
we are going to have the nato summit in a few days and the temptation will be to say the civilian training in afghanistan must be done by nato itself because the europeans are not doing as much as necessary and the americans will essentially work through nato .
i think this is as mistake .
because this will make civilians become part of a military operation .
we need to delink the civilian from the military .
of course the military is needed to guarantee the protection of the civilian training .
but we need to train the police in a different way then we train the military .
the police are trained to protect people , so we need to move toward this core aspect - human security and strategy where the main objective is to protect the civilians in afghanistan and not to kill the enemy .
because as president obama from day one said we should not be in afghanistan to kill civilians , but to protect them .
do you think europeans would support sending more police trainers to afghanistan ?
i think if there is a clear shift in the strategy in afghanistan in that we say we are not there to win a war , we are there to build an afghan state , an afghan army , an afghan police force , this would be welcome , because the people in europe want their soldiers home .
most public opinion polls in europe show that the majority of people want their soldiers back as soon as possible .
so if you devise a strategy that will bring your troops home - which is what president obama has announced - and you show that this is a crisis management and state-building operation that involves the united nations to a larger degree , that will get much more support in europe .
there has been a lot of debate in the past years whether or not the west should talk to the taliban .
what is your opinion ?
my sense is that there is more or less a consensus now in europe , and i think also in the united states , that there is a need for a political process .
you can speak about talking to taliban in two ways : one is to say we are talking with the good taliban .
we would then be dividing the taliban leadership by talking to local leaders and this would be a kind of counterinsurgency strategy .
this was used in iraq .
but the essential problem is that the taliban leadership will still be there and will still have a lot of support in some areas of the country and it will still be able to make war and create enormous difficulties to the international coalition . the other is to start communication at the highest level of the taliban in afghanistan .
but if you -lrb- do that , -rrb- the biggest difficulty is to decide what we want from them .
are we prepared to have the taliban in power again in kabul ?
what would be the impact of that in international public opinion - but especially in europe and the united states ?
the role of president karzai is a very contentious issue , which came up again recently after he confirmed reports that he was regularly accepting large sums of cash from iran .
is karzai for europe and the us still the best option to lead afghanistan ?
so far he is the only option .
no one has found a better option for afghanistan up to now .
we know that the elections were not very transparent and that it is important now to establish legitimacy and credibility .
but karzai is in power now , the election results were accepted after lots of doubts , and the europeans and the americans as well as the international community are now working with him .
and he is a very skillfull politician with many connections in afghanistan and he knows the country well , so he can start the process of talking with the taliban .
so he certainly is and will be playing an important political role .

among other things , vasconcelos addressed the outlook for european engagement in afghanistan .
deutsche welle : the war in afghanistan is now in its ninth year and the original goal of establishing a democracy there is all but gone .
europeans have been deeply skeptical of the afghan mission for a long time .
could europe do more in afghanistan ?
alvaro de vasconcelos : we can do more .
but to do more we should do it in a civilian way .
we are going to have the nato summit in a few days and the temptation will be to say the civilian training in afghanistan must be done by nato itself because the europeans are not doing as much as necessary and the americans will essentially work through nato .
i think this is as mistake .
because this will make civilians become part of a military operation .
we need to delink the civilian from the military .
of course the military is needed to guarantee the protection of the civilian training .

security is to be increased at all airports and train stations . germany 's interior minister has announced that security is being stepped up at airports and train stations across the country .
thomas de maiziere told reporters in berlin on wednesday that the move came in light of concrete information received , indicating that a terrorist attack was being planned for the end of november in germany .
" from today , there will be a visible police presence .
i thought it should be explained to citizens , " de maiziere said .
" there is reason for concern , but no reason for hysteria . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere : ' reason for concern , not hysteria ' de maiziere called on all citizens to be vigilant .
any unattended packages or bags should be reported to security officials . the increased alert applied to all of germany .
three scenarios the government did not provide any details , but security officials in berlin said three suspected threats had arisen . speaking on condition of anonymity , the officials said one involved senior al qaeda leader younis al mauretani , who was planning an operation against europe and the united states . the second involved a plot to carry out coordinated armed attacks similar to those that killed 166 people in the indian city of mumbai in 2008 .
indications emerged that between 15 and 25 militants were lying in wait in europe preparing for such a strike , potentially in germany , the officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the scenarios resembles the 2008 attacks in mumbai a third scenario pointed to sleeper cells already in germany , though no specific targets were identified . although the evidence pointed to a real threat , de maiziere called on germans to avoid overreating . " it is not cause and should not be cause for us to change our daily lives totally , " the minister said , comparing the situation to the security alarm surrounding germany 's federal elections in 2009 .
de maiziere said " a tip from an international partner after the yemen incident " alerted the interior ministry to the potential threat .
past threats from yemen earlier this month , the discovery of two us-bound parcel bombs sent via airmail from yemen raised new fears about security .
the parcel bombs coincided with package bombs sent by greek militants to chancellor angela merkel in berlin .
the german government responded by grounding all cargo planes originating from yemen , a ban that has since been lifted .
in october , de maiziere drew criticism after he warned against " alarmism " in the wake of travel alerts for europe issued by the united states , britain and japan .

two new studies say the country is n't doing enough to attract foreign talent and should do more to promote a " welcoming culture . " germany is only a moderately attractive destination for skilled immigrants , according to two recently released studies .
the conclusion of one of the studies , conducted by the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , is that the federal government is doing too little to attract qualified professionals from other countries .
" skilled professionals and students are n't waiting in line to bring their abilities to germany , " dihk president hans heinrich driftmann told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , adding , " this should worry us . "
according to one survey of 47 chambers of foreign trade , germany earned an attractiveness score of 2.8 , with one signifying " attractive " and five meaning " unattractive . "
the report states that germany needs to work on promoting a " welcoming culture , " according to the frankfurter rundschau , which published the findings of the report prior to its release .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driftmann says germany should reduce red tape qualified young turks living in germany were reported to feel undesired , while polish professionals in germany complained they were confronted by stereotypes casting them as " asparagus cutters and farming assistants . "
' sprechen sie deutsch ? '
according to the report , germany 's main problem in attracting skilled immigrants is its language .
german , it claims , is faring poorly internationally when compared to english or french .
the dihk blamed the problem on cuts to funding for the goethe institute , an organization that promotes the german language worldwide .
the german academic exchange service , which promotes foreign students coming to germany , also faced limited resources . the report also extended its criticism to the red tape surrounding visas and work permits in germany , which it said were complicated and confusing - and inconsistent from one jurisdiction to the next .
it further stated that over half a dozen eu member states regularly complained that their qualifications and professional degrees were not recognized in germany .
lowering the hurdles the dihk found a practice requiring foreign students to procure work permits and jobs within a year in germany to be counterproductive .
it said that this practice had led many qualified students to leave germany during the recent financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of executives and scholars leave germany every year the report recommended lowering the hurdles for foreign professionals to work in germany - at least for engineers and it workers .
the dihk also wants to see one regulation changed that automatically grants foreigners the right to settle in germany if they earn 66,000 euros -lrb- $ 89,100 -rrb- a year .
the chamber of commerce wants resident rights granted to immigrants who earn 40,000 euros or more .
the bottom line , according to driftmann , is that germany must be more welcoming to prospective immigrants .
only ' second-best ' the same could have been the credo of another study , conducted by the bib , a federal institute in the western city of wiesbaden , which studies germany 's population .
the institute 's study , which focuses on highly-qualified professional immigrants , concluded that germany was not a first-choice destination , but rather seen as a second- or third-best option .
the study , commissioned by the bertelsmann foundation , concluded that , between 2005 and 2009 , germany had lost around 1,500 executives and scholars yearly to other european union countries . nations like sweden , spain , austria , the united kingdom and belgium were much more attractive destinations for skilled workers , it said .
it remains unclear whether the opening of the german labor market to citizens of eastern eu states next year will change the situation , according to gunter thielen , chairman of the bertelsmann foundation 's board of directors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thielen says germany can learn from canada and sweden " we can look at other societies with successful immigration policies and adopt the best parts of their systems , " he said .
the bertelsmann foundation recommended taking aspects of the canadian or british models , which focus on immigrants ' qualifications and combining them with the swedish system , which is focused directly on the requirements of the labor market .

but the chief of the german central bank says banks should prepare for changes now . if there 's one thing the bankers and regulators gathered at the euro finance week in frankfurt agree on , it is that reform on a national level alone wo n't do much to stabilize the financial industry .
instead , they say that loopholes need to be plugged on an international level .
the german-centric economic forum started on monday , and there has been little doubt among attendees that action should be taken even before the stricter capital requirements of basel iii take effect in 2013 .
financial systems should be made more stable and resilient , they say .
german central bank president axel weber singled out german public-sector banks in his remarks .
" i believe , particularly in this sector , that the mikado-strategy that 's been pursued so far is leading nowhere , " weber said .
two such banks – bayernlb and westlb – recently failed in a merger attempt after receiving billions of taxpayer euros during the crisis .
the european commission set a new deadline of february 2011 for westlb to come up with ideas of how to sustain itself in the long term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels has given westlb a three-month deadline for restructuring weber said banks should n't be sluggish about making changes , and that they need to be proactive in preparing for coming regulations .
" changes will be coming to the market structure , " he said .
" there will be further changes .
the profiles of the actors will change , and the type and scope of the banking business will be affected .
" the refinancing structure of the banking system will change .
eventually there will also be less actors .
several will drop out – those which can not meet these new capital requirements . "
bankers have often complained about having to carry the high costs of the new regulations , but weber said that " a more stable financial system is worth the price . "
risks to international competition deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann spoke out against the notion of additional capital requirements for banks in germany , saying international competition is a concern .
what is needed is a method in which " banks which are a burden for the system – and therefore also taxpayers – can be eliminated , " he said .
" when you go to singapore , hong kong or shanghai today , then you experience what 's meant by location competition , " he said .
" and i believe we should always consider here what options we have to make the entire system more robust above all , but without giving up location advantages or tolerating location disadvantages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's ackermann defended big banking ackermann also defended large banking from skeptics who say banks were granted bailouts specifically because they had become too large to be allowed to fail .
" it is absolutely necessary that we define ourselves beyond national boundaries , " he said .
on monday a panel of economic journalists named ackermann ' european banker of the year ' for successfully leading his institution through the financial crisis .
asian banks ' ready ' according to wolfgang kirsch , ceo of dz bank , germany 's central cooperative bank , asian competitors are now primed and ready .
" after the asian crisis – this rough treatment which , in part , we 've been experiencing these days – this was something asian banks went through , " he said .
" and today they can happily call out , ' basel iii is n't an issue for us . '
anyone who says basel iii is n't an issue clearly has his own capital and liquidity .
and both of those things want to be utilized .
so we should keep an eye on that . "
the german central bank 's weber , however , foresees the need for regulation beyond just the banking system .
he said financial groups funneled billions of euros past regulators , agitating the financial crisis .
" we need to cast light into the shadows of the banking system , " he said .

deutsche welle spoke to the eu 's special envoy for myanmar , piero fassino . deutsche welle : myanmar 's military government released opposition leader aung san suu kyi after more than 15 years of detention .
how does the european union consider this move ? piero fassino : the most important thing , for her family and her people , is that aung san suu kyi is finally free .
what is also important is that she is enabled to come back to politics now , as myanmar is in a crucial and delicate phase .
elections have been held and a new parliament elected .
the new parliament will start working next february .
this will lead to a new civilian government , which should take over power from the military junta .
therefore , it could be the beginning of a period of political and institutional change and it is essential that suu kyi can participate as a major player in this new political phase . the recent elections were one step towards what the military rulers call " disciplined democracy . "
does the european union consider these elections to be truly democratic ? elections were held in a context that was strongly controlled and conditioned by the regime , according to dubious electoral laws and regulations , certainly not in line with european and international accepted standards . however , it needs also to be noted that during the electoral campaign civil society and opposition forces proved significantly lively .
it is also relevant that , notwithstanding all the existing obstacles , opposition parties registered for the elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icon suu kyi has promised to look into poll irregularities it will be very important to see the results .
depending on how many elected representatives from the opposition forces and ethnic groups win seats in the local and national parliaments , we will be able to give a more complete evaluation of these elections . burma is a very multiethnic society .
what position does the eu have about the ethnic minorities ' struggle for more autonomy ? the european union condemns any form of hostility and oppression against ethnic minorities .
in the framework of the current political transition , ethnic communities need to be fully associated to , and become part of , the political process . one of the essential issues to be dealt with in the context of the transition is precisely how to ensure the respect of the rights of the minorities , their autonomy and the possibility to participate in the life of the country without restraints . have the elections and the release of aung san suu kyi opened up a chance for a transformation process ? the release of aung san suu kyi is a first step .
now more steps into the right direction are needed : the release of all political detainees and the opening of a true , meaningful dialogue between the junta , the democratic opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities . in her first public speech after her release , aung san suu kyi explicitly urged the authorities to start a dialogue and expressed her availability to take up responsibilities in the management of the transition .
such a dialogue has to be free , honest and needs to aim at a definitive democratic transition allowing myanmar to reach those standards of freedom and democracy which are the mark of all free nations .
how will the eu press the government of myanmar towards a more pluralistic system ? we should not take anything for granted .
we certainly hope that the release of aung san suu kyi can open a door , and it is for this reason that we are asking , after her release , for more meaningful acts , clearly showing the will of the authorities for a democratic transition . bildunterschrift : fassino calls for more aid for cyclone-devastated areas the international community must keep myanmar as a priority on its political agenda and must accompany and assist the democratic transition .
therefore , we need a policy aimed at increasing our relations with myanmar . we must increase humanitarian assistance particularly in those areas devastated by the nargis typhoon , where reconstruction and rehabilitation is needed .
we must increase development aid in vital sectors for the burmese people , such as water , education , health and assistance to children .
we must also help civil society to structure itself and accompany myanmar in building up the democratic institutions that it has never had so far . interview : ana lehman editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 17.11.2010 terror alert levels reflect dangers difficult to verify großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police are increasingly patrolling train stations and airports germany 's interior minister ordered increased security across the country after its terror alert showed a heightened threat of a terrorist attack .
many countries use similar warning systems , first developed in the us . terror alert levels reflect the existing threat of an imminent terrorist attack , though such danger can hardly be measured .
the us department of homeland security developed such an advisory system following the september 11 attacks .
authorities raise the threat level to " high " - or in the worst case " severe " - if they receive pertinent information from their own intelligence service or other security authorities .
they also rely on intelligence data from other countries they work closely with .
this can involve tapped conversations , respective information in the internet or credible leads from informants in the jihadist scene .
it is very rarely based on a concrete lead .
members of german intelligence services recently questioned islamists in afghanistan for an entire week about terror scenarios in germany and europe .
according to security authorities , some 40 islamists from germany are currently residing in pakistan and afghanistan .
at the same time , around 200 specialists from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- have continued to work on verifying whether the latest terror warnings from the us are true .
this includes intensifying the surveillance of some 130 so-called " endangerers " living in germany .
various degrees of security measures normally , a collection of several indicators form a qualitative new threat situation .
this can result in a concrete terror alert officially announced to the public , in turn generally leading to increased controls at critical points in a country 's security structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere said new , tangible intelligence has come to light in germany , the federal interior minister and his counterparts in the individual states are responsible for this move .
the scope of possible measures to resort to range from ordering increased passenger and luggage controls at airports , monitoring train stations and major road junctions to temporarily closing embassies at particularly vulnerable locations .
in the united states , the government set up the five-tiered color-coded threat level system to protect against future accusations that security authorities did n't take information about the imminent 9/11 attacks seriously enough and inform the public .
germany 's interior minister thomas de maiziere probably had similar thoughts in his mind .
continual warnings last month , authorities discovered two us-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen , one of which went through cologne-bonn airport in western germany undetected .
it turned out that lufthansa had already tipped off the interior ministry about the terrorist threat from yemen .
the airline 's warning reportedly reached de maiziere already at the beginning of october - three weeks before the package bombs were found in europe .
in recent weeks , german media have also repeatedly reported on alleged imminent terrorist attacks in the us and europe .
in addition , there have been continual warnings by western intelligence services that terrorists could plan an attack still before christmas - though the al qaeda network has in the past liked to publicly spread such warnings for propaganda purposes .
other governments have also reacted with official terror warnings to the supposed changed security situation .
germany is the third eu nation after britain and france to announce such a warning to its population .

among other things , vasconcelos addressed the outlook for european engagement in afghanistan .
deutsche welle : the war in afghanistan is now in its ninth year and the original goal of establishing a democracy there is all but gone .
europeans have been deeply skeptical of the afghan mission for a long time .
could europe do more in afghanistan ?
alvaro de vasconcelos : we can do more .
but to do more we should do it in a civilian way .
we are going to have the nato summit in a few days and the temptation will be to say the civilian training in afghanistan must be done by nato itself because the europeans are not doing as much as necessary and the americans will essentially work through nato .
i think this is as mistake .
because this will make civilians become part of a military operation .
we need to delink the civilian from the military .
of course the military is needed to guarantee the protection of the civilian training .
but we need to train the police in a different way then we train the military .
the police are trained to protect people , so we need to move toward this core aspect - human security and strategy where the main objective is to protect the civilians in afghanistan and not to kill the enemy .
because as president obama from day one said we should not be in afghanistan to kill civilians , but to protect them .
do you think europeans would support sending more police trainers to afghanistan ?
i think if there is a clear shift in the strategy in afghanistan in that we say we are not there to win a war , we are there to build an afghan state , an afghan army , an afghan police force , this would be welcome , because the people in europe want their soldiers home .
most public opinion polls in europe show that the majority of people want their soldiers back as soon as possible .
so if you devise a strategy that will bring your troops home - which is what president obama has announced - and you show that this is a crisis management and state-building operation that involves the united nations to a larger degree , that will get much more support in europe .
there has been a lot of debate in the past years whether or not the west should talk to the taliban .
what is your opinion ?
my sense is that there is more or less a consensus now in europe , and i think also in the united states , that there is a need for a political process .
you can speak about talking to taliban in two ways : one is to say we are talking with the good taliban .
we would then be dividing the taliban leadership by talking to local leaders and this would be a kind of counterinsurgency strategy .
this was used in iraq .
but the essential problem is that the taliban leadership will still be there and will still have a lot of support in some areas of the country and it will still be able to make war and create enormous difficulties to the international coalition . the other is to start communication at the highest level of the taliban in afghanistan .
but if you -lrb- do that , -rrb- the biggest difficulty is to decide what we want from them .
are we prepared to have the taliban in power again in kabul ?
what would be the impact of that in international public opinion - but especially in europe and the united states ?
the role of president karzai is a very contentious issue , which came up again recently after he confirmed reports that he was regularly accepting large sums of cash from iran .
is karzai for europe and the us still the best option to lead afghanistan ?
so far he is the only option .
no one has found a better option for afghanistan up to now .
we know that the elections were not very transparent and that it is important now to establish legitimacy and credibility .
but karzai is in power now , the election results were accepted after lots of doubts , and the europeans and the americans as well as the international community are now working with him .
and he is a very skillfull politician with many connections in afghanistan and he knows the country well , so he can start the process of talking with the taliban .
so he certainly is and will be playing an important political role .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 17.11.2010 opinion : ireland needs to accept help the sooner , the better großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurozone finance ministers are taking a hard look at ireland , the latest member to come under intense bond market pressure .
dw 's bernd riegert believes ireland should accept aid - fast . the longer you wait , the more costly it gets .
in view of its rampant national debt and heavily indebted banks , ireland will have to accept help from the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
it is only a matter of days , maybe hours .
the eu finance ministers ' plans are ready , but ireland has so far steadfastly resisted applying for a state bailout .
this is a case of misplaced pride on the part of the country 's stricken prime minister , brian cowen .
the former celtic tiger is about to be skinned . cowen did not want to take responsibility for such action in front of his shaken voters .
he also fears the strict conditions that loans entail .
ireland would probably have to raise its extremely low corporate taxes and aggravate the economic crisis further still . every day of hesitation forces the cost of loans on the financial markets to skyrocket , while share prices drop . ireland 's finance minister has finally admitted that the problems seem to have become too big for the small country .
the crisis does not only affect ireland , it affects all of europe .
after all , the european central bank has tirelessly been pumping money into the irish budget , where it buys government bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoid a chain reaction ireland is as good as bankrupt and the eu 's larger member states , including britain that does not have the euro as its currency , will have to help the nation in order to protect their own interests .
ireland is indebted for the most part to britain , germany , the us and france .
an irish insolvency would hit the banks in europe : for instance germany 's state-run hre bank .
it is clearly in europe 's own interest to save ireland - the sooner , the better .
a chain reaction might still be averted , although portugal and possibly spain also stand on the edge of a precipice .
that is what european council president herman van rompuy must have had in mind when he said that the 16 states of the eurozone and the entire eu are fighting for survival .
it is alarming that the financial markets are reacting with a drop in the price of government bonds to chancellor angela merkel 's remarks that private investors should share the costs of state insolvencies after 2013 . debtors want to make money , but they do n't want to carry the risks , and that has to stop .
however , financial markets and investors currently still have the upper hand .
they act and politics is forced to react by using taxpayers ' money to buy time for bankrupt states .
in essence , that is what the bailout is : a safety net .
whether this structure will manage to stabilize the european currency and the financial system remains to be seen .
we are in the midst of a huge experiment .
in the case of greece , 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- were pledged and about 40 billion have been paid .
the next installment ca n't be made because the country has n't completely fulfilled its obligations .
the next crisis is already on the horizon .
the safety net is beginning to tear .

" the situation is very pressing and very , very serious and we do n't have any time to waste , " eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters after meetings in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they are talks , not bailout negotiations : lenihan " it is essential that confidence in the irish banking sector is restored for the sake of financial stability in europe and for the sake of restoring confidence in the economy . "
irish finance minister brian lenihan confirmed that the emergency talks would begin in dublin on thursday but issued no details on what shape the bailout could take or its possible size .
" we have agreed to look at the structural problems in the irish banks in the light of recent market pressures and assess what needs to be done because banking questions are technical and difficult , " lenihan told irish state radio on wednesday .
dublin reluctant to become ' europe 's lackey ' according to an article published in the wall street journal on wednesday , the irish banking sector is up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering for themselves .
investors fear the final figure could be even higher given rising mortgage arrears , deposit outflows and higher funding costs .

" there has been no question of the government -lsb- being -rsb- in a negotiation for a bailout , " he said , dismissing the term as pejorative and referring to the fact that the state of ireland is pre-funded until the middle of next year .
meanwhile , the irish people share their prime minister 's resistance to financial assistance from brussels or anywhere else ; in the streets of the irish capital , a european bailout would be a downright " humiliation . "

" i would rather be poor and free than a poor lackey of europe .
it 's time to stand up and be irish once again , " he added .
more eu members to require assistance ?
also on wednesday , eu finance ministers pledged to agree on stricter debt rules by mid-2011 , as well as on a new rescue fund for dangerously indebted countries such as greece - which received substantial eu funds earlier this year to avoid bankruptcy - and a number of other eurozone members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von rompuy : resolution of the crisis is critical for the eu portugal and spain , which are already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , have both alluded to budgetary difficulties .

but the ministers gave a clear signal that " determined and coordinated " action had to be taken to resolve the debt crisis that is threatening the future financial stability of europe and the 16-member , single-currency eurozone .
" if we do n't survive with the eurozone we will not survive with the european union , " european council president herman von rompuy said .

most meet their husbands through marriage agencies . one vietnamese woman at the shelter , who seems to be in her early 20s , asks to be called hong . she recalls the day when a marriage broker knocked at her family ’ s door : " the madam came to all the homes in my neighborhood , trying to find women to marry south korean men .
she persuaded me .
at first my family was against my doing this , but i decided it was best for me to go to south korea . " even worse than imagined hong was married to a korean man just one day after meeting him .
she knew life in korea would n't be easy as neither she nor her husband spoke each other 's language .
however , it was much worse than she had imagined . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a shortage of women in south korea 's countryside because they are flocking to the cities to work " my husband would drink all day and night .
every night he would pressure me into having sex .
even his sister would tell me that i had ruined his life , so i got no support from him or his family .
but i did n't go back to vietnam because i did n't want to burden my family with these problems , " she explains . when hong did finally complain to a counselor at her marriage agency , her husband got violent .
during one fight , he even pulled a knife on her .
the police were called and hong was taken to the shelter . hong claims the marriage agency , which introduced her to her husband covered up his drinking and lied about his income and housing situation . women are treated as sex slaves that 's not at all unusual , says a catholic nun who helps run the shelter .
she doesn ’ t give her name out of fear for the safety of the women living there . " these women from southeast asia are very poor and have no voice , " she points out .
" the korean men disregard these women , they do not think of them as people .
they think that they buy them with their money so they treat them as slaves – as sex slaves .
this is modern slavery . " she adds the marriage agencies are the most to blame for the problems that are occurring . marriage brokers have already come under fire in parts of southeast asia .
earlier this year , cambodia banned korean agencies from operating there . my requests for interviews with several brokers in seoul were refused . after all the bad press and complaints from human rights groups about these agencies , the government here has decided to act . agencies will be closely monitored song ji eun , an official at south korea ’ s ministry of gender equality and family , says the agencies have hurt her nation 's image abroad . bildunterschrift : it is sometimes poverty in vietnam and cambodia that convinces women to marry foreign men she explains that " to prevent the abuse of foreign brides , especially considering the murder of a vietnamese woman earlier this year , the government will now require all marriage agencies to disclose private information about their male clients . " the law , which comes into effect on thursday , will " force agencies to provide results of a full financial , medical and criminal background check to prospective foreign brides .
if they refuse to comply they will lose their license in south korea , " she adds . however , brokers will not be penalized if a husband later beats or kills his wife . " i just want a normal life " hong , who found out too late that her husband was an abusive alcoholic , says now she does not want to see her matchmaker or her estranged spouse punished . she has bigger concerns as she is seven months pregnant : " i just want my husband to help me support our child .
i do n't want to go back to vietnam and i will stay in this shelter .
i just want to have a normal life here in korea . " hong plans to divorce her husband eventually but would like to stay in south korea .
the courts will have to grant her custody .
for now , her husband is denying the baby is his . author : jason strother -lrb- seoul -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

security is to be increased at all airports and train stations . germany 's interior minister has announced that security is being stepped up at airports and train stations across the country .
thomas de maiziere told reporters in berlin on wednesday that the move came in light of concrete information received , indicating that a terrorist attack was being planned for the end of november in germany .
" from today , there will be a visible police presence .
i thought it should be explained to citizens , " de maiziere said .
" there is reason for concern , but no reason for hysteria . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere : ' reason for concern , not hysteria ' de maiziere called on all citizens to be vigilant .
any unattended packages or bags should be reported to security officials . the increased alert applied to all of germany .
three scenarios the government did not provide any details , but security officials in berlin said three suspected threats had arisen . speaking on condition of anonymity , the officials said one involved senior al qaeda leader younis al mauretani , who was planning an operation against europe and the united states . the second involved a plot to carry out coordinated armed attacks similar to those that killed 166 people in the indian city of mumbai in 2008 .
indications emerged that between 15 and 25 militants were lying in wait in europe preparing for such a strike , potentially in germany , the officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the scenarios resembles the 2008 attacks in mumbai a third scenario pointed to sleeper cells already in germany , though no specific targets were identified . although the evidence pointed to a real threat , de maiziere called on germans to avoid overreating . " it is not cause and should not be cause for us to change our daily lives totally , " the minister said , comparing the situation to the security alarm surrounding germany 's federal elections in 2009 .
de maiziere said " a tip from an international partner after the yemen incident " alerted the interior ministry to the potential threat .
past threats from yemen earlier this month , the discovery of two us-bound parcel bombs sent via airmail from yemen raised new fears about security .
the parcel bombs coincided with package bombs sent by greek militants to chancellor angela merkel in berlin .
the german government responded by grounding all cargo planes originating from yemen , a ban that has since been lifted .
in october , de maiziere drew criticism after he warned against " alarmism " in the wake of travel alerts for europe issued by the united states , britain and japan .

this power play has caused poland many headaches .
but new know-how in gas production could mark a turn in events . practically every winter , russia and its neighbors ukraine and belarus disagree on gas supply technicalities .
this dispute has endangered deliveries to poland .
the baltic sea pipeline , which will connect western european markets with major russian gas fields , has made matters worse .
warsaw 's politicians feel they will be at moscow 's mercy because russia can then shut off the supply without endangering its deliveries to germany .
but this headache could soon be over .
the largest deposits of shale gas in europe are assumed to be located on polish territory .
new technology from the united states could make it possible to exploit these gas reserves .
test drillings are planned all across the country .
according to geologists , poland could become the largest gas supplier in europe after norway and russia .
it would make the eastern european country rich - much richer than previously assumed , said energy expert pawel nierada from the sobieski institute in warsaw .
" conservative estimates already show that poland could suddenly become a serious exporter on the european gas market , " nierada said .
" the reserves exceed our country 's consumption many times over .
it 's hard to imagine what it would be like if the more optimistic estimates of the us government were to turn out to be true .
then , here in poland , we would have more gas than norway . "
skeptics question new technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland could soon control its own gas distribution natural gas which is produced in europe and asia has so far been relatively easy to access .
it lies in enormous bubbles under impermeable layers of earth , for example out of clay .
shale gas , on the other hand , is located in the middle of rock beds .
it 's nothing new that this valuable resource exists there .
but no one was ever interested in it before , because production was considered to be difficult and therefore uneconomical .
but that has changed .
in the united states , shale gas already covers 20 percent of gas consumption .
new technology used over the past few years has made this possible .
special drills first make their way into the ground vertically and then , when they reach the rock bed with the gas , bend into a horizontal position .
there , they pump a chemical liquid into the ground , which causes the rock bed to burst open .
the gas can then flow .
but many people are skeptical about this procedure , nierada said .
" there are also critical voices which say that the technology is still in its infancy - the experts from the russian gas company gazprom , for example , " he said .
" but in the united states , the production works .
and international firms believe it will be successful in poland , too .
otherwise , they would n't have already invested so much money in licenses and test drilling . "
the polish government has already issued some 60 licenses for test drillings , mainly to american companies .
it 's no wonder that this is cause for concern further to the east - in moscow .
after all , gas exports make up a significant part of russia 's gross domestic product .
they could stagnate or even decrease as a result of the polish finds .
gazprom has already admitted that it is n't able to sell as much to the united states as it used to because of the shale gas reserves there .
in a report , the company even said shale gas could " fundamentally change " the worldwide gas market .

lack of political support production in poland could begin in ten years at the earliest , gas companies said .

then , the country could fulfill a dream it has had for hundreds of years : to be economically - and therefore also politically - independent from russia .

deutsche welle spoke to the eu 's special envoy for myanmar , piero fassino . deutsche welle : myanmar 's military government released opposition leader aung san suu kyi after more than 15 years of detention .
how does the european union consider this move ? piero fassino : the most important thing , for her family and her people , is that aung san suu kyi is finally free .
what is also important is that she is enabled to come back to politics now , as myanmar is in a crucial and delicate phase .
elections have been held and a new parliament elected .
the new parliament will start working next february .
this will lead to a new civilian government , which should take over power from the military junta .
therefore , it could be the beginning of a period of political and institutional change and it is essential that suu kyi can participate as a major player in this new political phase . the recent elections were one step towards what the military rulers call " disciplined democracy . "
does the european union consider these elections to be truly democratic ? elections were held in a context that was strongly controlled and conditioned by the regime , according to dubious electoral laws and regulations , certainly not in line with european and international accepted standards . however , it needs also to be noted that during the electoral campaign civil society and opposition forces proved significantly lively .
it is also relevant that , notwithstanding all the existing obstacles , opposition parties registered for the elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icon suu kyi has promised to look into poll irregularities it will be very important to see the results .
depending on how many elected representatives from the opposition forces and ethnic groups win seats in the local and national parliaments , we will be able to give a more complete evaluation of these elections . burma is a very multiethnic society .
what position does the eu have about the ethnic minorities ' struggle for more autonomy ? the european union condemns any form of hostility and oppression against ethnic minorities .
in the framework of the current political transition , ethnic communities need to be fully associated to , and become part of , the political process . one of the essential issues to be dealt with in the context of the transition is precisely how to ensure the respect of the rights of the minorities , their autonomy and the possibility to participate in the life of the country without restraints . have the elections and the release of aung san suu kyi opened up a chance for a transformation process ? the release of aung san suu kyi is a first step .
now more steps into the right direction are needed : the release of all political detainees and the opening of a true , meaningful dialogue between the junta , the democratic opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities . in her first public speech after her release , aung san suu kyi explicitly urged the authorities to start a dialogue and expressed her availability to take up responsibilities in the management of the transition .
such a dialogue has to be free , honest and needs to aim at a definitive democratic transition allowing myanmar to reach those standards of freedom and democracy which are the mark of all free nations .
how will the eu press the government of myanmar towards a more pluralistic system ? we should not take anything for granted .
we certainly hope that the release of aung san suu kyi can open a door , and it is for this reason that we are asking , after her release , for more meaningful acts , clearly showing the will of the authorities for a democratic transition . bildunterschrift : fassino calls for more aid for cyclone-devastated areas the international community must keep myanmar as a priority on its political agenda and must accompany and assist the democratic transition .
therefore , we need a policy aimed at increasing our relations with myanmar . we must increase humanitarian assistance particularly in those areas devastated by the nargis typhoon , where reconstruction and rehabilitation is needed .
we must increase development aid in vital sectors for the burmese people , such as water , education , health and assistance to children .
we must also help civil society to structure itself and accompany myanmar in building up the democratic institutions that it has never had so far . interview : ana lehman editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the chief of the german central bank says banks should prepare for changes now . if there 's one thing the bankers and regulators gathered at the euro finance week in frankfurt agree on , it is that reform on a national level alone wo n't do much to stabilize the financial industry .
instead , they say that loopholes need to be plugged on an international level .
the german-centric economic forum started on monday , and there has been little doubt among attendees that action should be taken even before the stricter capital requirements of basel iii take effect in 2013 .
financial systems should be made more stable and resilient , they say .
german central bank president axel weber singled out german public-sector banks in his remarks .
" i believe , particularly in this sector , that the mikado-strategy that 's been pursued so far is leading nowhere , " weber said .
two such banks – bayernlb and westlb – recently failed in a merger attempt after receiving billions of taxpayer euros during the crisis .
the european commission set a new deadline of february 2011 for westlb to come up with ideas of how to sustain itself in the long term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels has given westlb a three-month deadline for restructuring weber said banks should n't be sluggish about making changes , and that they need to be proactive in preparing for coming regulations .
" changes will be coming to the market structure , " he said .
" there will be further changes .
the profiles of the actors will change , and the type and scope of the banking business will be affected .
" the refinancing structure of the banking system will change .
eventually there will also be less actors .
several will drop out – those which can not meet these new capital requirements . "
bankers have often complained about having to carry the high costs of the new regulations , but weber said that " a more stable financial system is worth the price . "
risks to international competition deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann spoke out against the notion of additional capital requirements for banks in germany , saying international competition is a concern .
what is needed is a method in which " banks which are a burden for the system – and therefore also taxpayers – can be eliminated , " he said .
" when you go to singapore , hong kong or shanghai today , then you experience what 's meant by location competition , " he said .
" and i believe we should always consider here what options we have to make the entire system more robust above all , but without giving up location advantages or tolerating location disadvantages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's ackermann defended big banking ackermann also defended large banking from skeptics who say banks were granted bailouts specifically because they had become too large to be allowed to fail .
" it is absolutely necessary that we define ourselves beyond national boundaries , " he said .
on monday a panel of economic journalists named ackermann ' european banker of the year ' for successfully leading his institution through the financial crisis .
asian banks ' ready ' according to wolfgang kirsch , ceo of dz bank , germany 's central cooperative bank , asian competitors are now primed and ready .
" after the asian crisis – this rough treatment which , in part , we 've been experiencing these days – this was something asian banks went through , " he said .
" and today they can happily call out , ' basel iii is n't an issue for us . '
anyone who says basel iii is n't an issue clearly has his own capital and liquidity .
and both of those things want to be utilized .
so we should keep an eye on that . "
the german central bank 's weber , however , foresees the need for regulation beyond just the banking system .
he said financial groups funneled billions of euros past regulators , agitating the financial crisis .
" we need to cast light into the shadows of the banking system , " he said .

among other things , vasconcelos addressed the outlook for european engagement in afghanistan .
deutsche welle : the war in afghanistan is now in its ninth year and the original goal of establishing a democracy there is all but gone .
europeans have been deeply skeptical of the afghan mission for a long time .
could europe do more in afghanistan ?
alvaro de vasconcelos : we can do more .
but to do more we should do it in a civilian way .
we are going to have the nato summit in a few days and the temptation will be to say the civilian training in afghanistan must be done by nato itself because the europeans are not doing as much as necessary and the americans will essentially work through nato .
i think this is as mistake .
because this will make civilians become part of a military operation .
we need to delink the civilian from the military .
of course the military is needed to guarantee the protection of the civilian training .
but we need to train the police in a different way then we train the military .
the police are trained to protect people , so we need to move toward this core aspect - human security and strategy where the main objective is to protect the civilians in afghanistan and not to kill the enemy .
because as president obama from day one said we should not be in afghanistan to kill civilians , but to protect them .
do you think europeans would support sending more police trainers to afghanistan ?
i think if there is a clear shift in the strategy in afghanistan in that we say we are not there to win a war , we are there to build an afghan state , an afghan army , an afghan police force , this would be welcome , because the people in europe want their soldiers home .
most public opinion polls in europe show that the majority of people want their soldiers back as soon as possible .
so if you devise a strategy that will bring your troops home - which is what president obama has announced - and you show that this is a crisis management and state-building operation that involves the united nations to a larger degree , that will get much more support in europe .
there has been a lot of debate in the past years whether or not the west should talk to the taliban .
what is your opinion ?
my sense is that there is more or less a consensus now in europe , and i think also in the united states , that there is a need for a political process .
you can speak about talking to taliban in two ways : one is to say we are talking with the good taliban .
we would then be dividing the taliban leadership by talking to local leaders and this would be a kind of counterinsurgency strategy .
this was used in iraq .
but the essential problem is that the taliban leadership will still be there and will still have a lot of support in some areas of the country and it will still be able to make war and create enormous difficulties to the international coalition . the other is to start communication at the highest level of the taliban in afghanistan .
but if you -lrb- do that , -rrb- the biggest difficulty is to decide what we want from them .
are we prepared to have the taliban in power again in kabul ?
what would be the impact of that in international public opinion - but especially in europe and the united states ?
the role of president karzai is a very contentious issue , which came up again recently after he confirmed reports that he was regularly accepting large sums of cash from iran .
is karzai for europe and the us still the best option to lead afghanistan ?
so far he is the only option .
no one has found a better option for afghanistan up to now .
we know that the elections were not very transparent and that it is important now to establish legitimacy and credibility .
but karzai is in power now , the election results were accepted after lots of doubts , and the europeans and the americans as well as the international community are now working with him .
and he is a very skillfull politician with many connections in afghanistan and he knows the country well , so he can start the process of talking with the taliban .
so he certainly is and will be playing an important political role .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 17.11.2010 italy 's government hangs by a thread großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : silvio berlusconi 's days in politics appear to be numbered prime minister silvio berlusconi is confident of overcoming the latest political crisis in his government .
his survival will depend on what happens in confidence votes scheduled for early december . the latest italian drama began when deputy industry minister adolfo urso went on national television to announce he had resigned from prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right government , along with three other ministers .
" we propose a new government , a new majority , a new agenda for reform , " urso said .
" berlusconi is holing himself up in his palace like in a bunker . "
fed up with yet another berlusconi scandal involving young women and prostitutes , the leader 's former allies said they wanted to form a new center-right coalition with a new leader - one capable of addressing italy 's economic slowdown .
the four mps who resigned are supporters of parliamentary speaker gianfranco fini , a former ally of berlusconi turned rival .
they are part of fini 's new center-right splinter group called future and freedom .
for now , though , berlusconi remains in power - barely .
but barely has often been enough for italy 's richest man , who controls 90 percent of italian television and has vast holdings in newspapers and publishing companies .
he faces a confidence vote in both chambers of parliament on december 14 .
if he loses in either , he would be forced to resign and trigger early elections .
a strong grasp on power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finia was a neo-fascist turned mainstream conservative berlusconi said on wednesday he was confident he could win .
but most political experts expect him to be defeated in the lower house , where he no longer has a guaranteed majority since he split with fini last summer .
still , journalist christopher winner said it was unlikely berlusconi will go away without a ferocious political fight .
" it 's all about loyalty and the concept of betrayal ; it 's fairly straight-forward latin stuff , " said winner , the editor and italian political columnist for the rome-based the american magazine .
he added that despite berlusconi 's reputation as a corrupt buffoon outside italy , inside the country , the billionaire is still the most powerful person - and one who demands complete loyalty .
" he has tremendous power at almost every level of italian life , " winner said .
" it 's extremely possible that he 's warning some of the fini insiders that should they go through with their warning against him , they will pay in one way or another . "
population divided while support for berlusconi has weakened in parliament , italy 's population remains divided .
a poll published in the newspaper corriere della sera last weekend showed that 27 percent of italians said they 'd still vote for berlusconi 's people of freedom party .
it was followed by the center-left opposition democratic party at 24 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have ridiculed berlusconi in past protests for his supporters , berlusconi has made a positive difference , especially in his response to emergencies like the flooding in the north and the earthquake in l 'aquila .
they said he has helped italy navigate the financial crisis .
others feel the time has come for a change .
they have grown weary of his raucous private life , which has distracted him from the country 's real problems .
the beginning of the end winner said despite berlusconi 's power , his days in politics are likely numbered .
" this is the end of the cycle , it 's only a matter of time , " winner said about the 74-year-old .
" the only thing that berlusconi wanted was to get through this mandate .
this was the last time around .
what 's galling him is that is being denied him , the chance of seeing through this legislature as he did the previous one and it 's coming from within his own party , which is absolutely and utterly intolerable to him . "
meanwhile , on the same day as the confidence votes , italy 's constitutional court is due to rule on whether berlusconi has to face trial over charges that he bribed british lawyer david mills to give false testimony to protect his business interests .
but italians know not to write berlusconi off too soon .
he has bounced back before , surviving a string of sex scandals and corruption accusations .
the votes in december will show whether the time has come for him to finally leave italy 's political stage .

many countries use similar warning systems , first developed in the us . terror alert levels reflect the existing threat of an imminent terrorist attack , though such danger can hardly be measured .
the us department of homeland security developed such an advisory system following the september 11 attacks .
authorities raise the threat level to " high " - or in the worst case " severe " - if they receive pertinent information from their own intelligence service or other security authorities .
they also rely on intelligence data from other countries they work closely with .
this can involve tapped conversations , respective information in the internet or credible leads from informants in the jihadist scene .
it is very rarely based on a concrete lead .
members of german intelligence services recently questioned islamists in afghanistan for an entire week about terror scenarios in germany and europe .
according to security authorities , some 40 islamists from germany are currently residing in pakistan and afghanistan .
at the same time , around 200 specialists from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- have continued to work on verifying whether the latest terror warnings from the us are true .
this includes intensifying the surveillance of some 130 so-called " endangerers " living in germany .
various degrees of security measures normally , a collection of several indicators form a qualitative new threat situation .
this can result in a concrete terror alert officially announced to the public , in turn generally leading to increased controls at critical points in a country 's security structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere said new , tangible intelligence has come to light in germany , the federal interior minister and his counterparts in the individual states are responsible for this move .
the scope of possible measures to resort to range from ordering increased passenger and luggage controls at airports , monitoring train stations and major road junctions to temporarily closing embassies at particularly vulnerable locations .
in the united states , the government set up the five-tiered color-coded threat level system to protect against future accusations that security authorities did n't take information about the imminent 9/11 attacks seriously enough and inform the public .
germany 's interior minister thomas de maiziere probably had similar thoughts in his mind .
continual warnings last month , authorities discovered two us-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen , one of which went through cologne-bonn airport in western germany undetected .
it turned out that lufthansa had already tipped off the interior ministry about the terrorist threat from yemen .
the airline 's warning reportedly reached de maiziere already at the beginning of october - three weeks before the package bombs were found in europe .
in recent weeks , german media have also repeatedly reported on alleged imminent terrorist attacks in the us and europe .
in addition , there have been continual warnings by western intelligence services that terrorists could plan an attack still before christmas - though the al qaeda network has in the past liked to publicly spread such warnings for propaganda purposes .
other governments have also reacted with official terror warnings to the supposed changed security situation .
germany is the third eu nation after britain and france to announce such a warning to its population .

greece 's 2010 deficit is even higher than thought . austrian finance minister josef proell announced wednesday that the decision to grant the delay was made on the sidelines of the eu finance ministers ' meeting in bruessels on tuesday night .
proell said austria would not release its share of the money because greece had not fulfilled the requirements of the bailout agreement .
however , the eu has denied that the next loan payout will be delayed .
the office of the eu 's monetary affairs chief refuted austria 's claims , saying " it has always been the case that the actual release of the third tranche should be taken in december and that the release will be in january . "
the european union and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- agreed to lend athens 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- earlier this year to save the debt-wracked nation from bankruptcy . the money is to be doled out over three years , in accordance with the country 's progress in reducing its budget deficit .
in return , the greek government of prime minister giorgos papandreou agreed to enact drastic austerity measures in order to get the deficit under 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- by 2014 . on monday the european statistics agency eurostat announced that greece 's 2009 deficit would exceed earlier forecasts , climbing 2 points to 15.4 of gdp , almost 2 points higher than the previously indicated 13.6 percent .

dw 's bernd riegert believes ireland should accept aid - fast . the longer you wait , the more costly it gets .
in view of its rampant national debt and heavily indebted banks , ireland will have to accept help from the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
it is only a matter of days , maybe hours .
the eu finance ministers ' plans are ready , but ireland has so far steadfastly resisted applying for a state bailout .
this is a case of misplaced pride on the part of the country 's stricken prime minister , brian cowen .
the former celtic tiger is about to be skinned . cowen did not want to take responsibility for such action in front of his shaken voters .
he also fears the strict conditions that loans entail .
ireland would probably have to raise its extremely low corporate taxes and aggravate the economic crisis further still . every day of hesitation forces the cost of loans on the financial markets to skyrocket , while share prices drop . ireland 's finance minister has finally admitted that the problems seem to have become too big for the small country .
the crisis does not only affect ireland , it affects all of europe .
after all , the european central bank has tirelessly been pumping money into the irish budget , where it buys government bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoid a chain reaction ireland is as good as bankrupt and the eu 's larger member states , including britain that does not have the euro as its currency , will have to help the nation in order to protect their own interests .
ireland is indebted for the most part to britain , germany , the us and france .
an irish insolvency would hit the banks in europe : for instance germany 's state-run hre bank .
it is clearly in europe 's own interest to save ireland - the sooner , the better .
a chain reaction might still be averted , although portugal and possibly spain also stand on the edge of a precipice .
that is what european council president herman van rompuy must have had in mind when he said that the 16 states of the eurozone and the entire eu are fighting for survival .
it is alarming that the financial markets are reacting with a drop in the price of government bonds to chancellor angela merkel 's remarks that private investors should share the costs of state insolvencies after 2013 . debtors want to make money , but they do n't want to carry the risks , and that has to stop .
however , financial markets and investors currently still have the upper hand .
they act and politics is forced to react by using taxpayers ' money to buy time for bankrupt states .
in essence , that is what the bailout is : a safety net .
whether this structure will manage to stabilize the european currency and the financial system remains to be seen .
we are in the midst of a huge experiment .
in the case of greece , 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- were pledged and about 40 billion have been paid .
the next installment ca n't be made because the country has n't completely fulfilled its obligations .
the next crisis is already on the horizon .
the safety net is beginning to tear .

many countries use similar warning systems , first developed in the us . terror alert levels reflect the existing threat of an imminent terrorist attack , though such danger can hardly be measured .
the us department of homeland security developed such an advisory system following the september 11 attacks .
authorities raise the threat level to " high " - or in the worst case " severe " - if they receive pertinent information from their own intelligence service or other security authorities .
they also rely on intelligence data from other countries they work closely with .
this can involve tapped conversations , respective information in the internet or credible leads from informants in the jihadist scene .
it is very rarely based on a concrete lead .
members of german intelligence services recently questioned islamists in afghanistan for an entire week about terror scenarios in germany and europe .
according to security authorities , some 40 islamists from germany are currently residing in pakistan and afghanistan .
at the same time , around 200 specialists from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- have continued to work on verifying whether the latest terror warnings from the us are true .
this includes intensifying the surveillance of some 130 so-called " endangerers " living in germany .
various degrees of security measures normally , a collection of several indicators form a qualitative new threat situation .
this can result in a concrete terror alert officially announced to the public , in turn generally leading to increased controls at critical points in a country 's security structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere said new , tangible intelligence has come to light in germany , the federal interior minister and his counterparts in the individual states are responsible for this move .
the scope of possible measures to resort to range from ordering increased passenger and luggage controls at airports , monitoring train stations and major road junctions to temporarily closing embassies at particularly vulnerable locations .
in the united states , the government set up the five-tiered color-coded threat level system to protect against future accusations that security authorities did n't take information about the imminent 9/11 attacks seriously enough and inform the public .
germany 's interior minister thomas de maiziere probably had similar thoughts in his mind .
continual warnings last month , authorities discovered two us-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen , one of which went through cologne-bonn airport in western germany undetected .
it turned out that lufthansa had already tipped off the interior ministry about the terrorist threat from yemen .
the airline 's warning reportedly reached de maiziere already at the beginning of october - three weeks before the package bombs were found in europe .
in recent weeks , german media have also repeatedly reported on alleged imminent terrorist attacks in the us and europe .
in addition , there have been continual warnings by western intelligence services that terrorists could plan an attack still before christmas - though the al qaeda network has in the past liked to publicly spread such warnings for propaganda purposes .
other governments have also reacted with official terror warnings to the supposed changed security situation .
germany is the third eu nation after britain and france to announce such a warning to its population .

both proponents and detractors are claiming to represent the interests of poor farmers . the mexican government first lifted its ban on experimental crops of genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- maize last year , freeing the way for field trials in the country where the crop was first domesticated . but , much like in europe where opposition to cultivating genetically modified crops has been strong , some small-scale farmers and environmental protection groups have criticized the government 's decision to add modified crops to the roughly 60 types of maize traditionally cultivated in mexico . for family farmers like rogelio sanchez , who lives in the village vicente guerrero , maize is more than just a crop and deserves to be protected from genetic alteration . " maize is sacred to us , " he said of the staple that has been cultivated in mexico for some 7,000 years .
" it 's the foundation of our diet and a part of our cultural identity that we inherited from our forefathers . " conflicting interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 60 sorts of maize cultivated in mexico a village of about 200 families , mostly working one-to-two-hectare subsistence farms , together with a group of farmers in vicente guerrero have joined forces to promote traditional farming methods that call for natural seeds , composting and no pesticides . the group 's agricultural methods are a far cry from the kind of agriculture being trialed in mexico 's north , although the government has n't yet given the green light to commercial production of gm maize , as it already has for genetically modified cotton . the modified maize would help farmers - especially cash-strapped small-time farmers - increase the size of their harvests without significantly increasing costs , according to ariel alvarez of mexico 's inter-secretarial commission on biosafety of genetically modified organisms -lrb- cibiogem -rrb- . " some people call it genetic contamination , but others say that this gene can help the people who need it most : small-time farmers , " he said . " the farmers who do n't have the money to buy pesticides and end up losing half of their harvests could benefit .
are we going to call that contamination ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters say gm maize would increase harvest sizes calming fears to help calm people 's fears about gm crops , alvarez and other officials recently opened the commission 's doors to inform the public and take questions . one of their arguments is that the government does not force farmers to buy and use the modified seeds sold by monsanto and other companies . the commission also claims that more research into genetically modified crops is necessary , and that it could become a substantial source of future income and transform mexico from a niche market into a global player . aleira lara of the environmental protection group greenpeace has , however , warned that the government risks opening a pandora 's box , because it is not known how the gm crops will affect indigenous varieties of maize . she added that mexico , the birthplace of corn crops , was a valuable country for biotech companies trying to win over regulators to their cause . " mexico is a symbol for monsanto , " she said .
" if they get permission for genetically modified maize here , it 's like a springboard for other countries where there has been opposition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 17.11.2010 opinion : ireland needs to accept help the sooner , the better großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurozone finance ministers are taking a hard look at ireland , the latest member to come under intense bond market pressure .
dw 's bernd riegert believes ireland should accept aid - fast . the longer you wait , the more costly it gets .
in view of its rampant national debt and heavily indebted banks , ireland will have to accept help from the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
it is only a matter of days , maybe hours .
the eu finance ministers ' plans are ready , but ireland has so far steadfastly resisted applying for a state bailout .
this is a case of misplaced pride on the part of the country 's stricken prime minister , brian cowen .
the former celtic tiger is about to be skinned . cowen did not want to take responsibility for such action in front of his shaken voters .
he also fears the strict conditions that loans entail .
ireland would probably have to raise its extremely low corporate taxes and aggravate the economic crisis further still . every day of hesitation forces the cost of loans on the financial markets to skyrocket , while share prices drop . ireland 's finance minister has finally admitted that the problems seem to have become too big for the small country .
the crisis does not only affect ireland , it affects all of europe .
after all , the european central bank has tirelessly been pumping money into the irish budget , where it buys government bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoid a chain reaction ireland is as good as bankrupt and the eu 's larger member states , including britain that does not have the euro as its currency , will have to help the nation in order to protect their own interests .
ireland is indebted for the most part to britain , germany , the us and france .
an irish insolvency would hit the banks in europe : for instance germany 's state-run hre bank .
it is clearly in europe 's own interest to save ireland - the sooner , the better .
a chain reaction might still be averted , although portugal and possibly spain also stand on the edge of a precipice .
that is what european council president herman van rompuy must have had in mind when he said that the 16 states of the eurozone and the entire eu are fighting for survival .
it is alarming that the financial markets are reacting with a drop in the price of government bonds to chancellor angela merkel 's remarks that private investors should share the costs of state insolvencies after 2013 . debtors want to make money , but they do n't want to carry the risks , and that has to stop .
however , financial markets and investors currently still have the upper hand .
they act and politics is forced to react by using taxpayers ' money to buy time for bankrupt states .
in essence , that is what the bailout is : a safety net .
whether this structure will manage to stabilize the european currency and the financial system remains to be seen .
we are in the midst of a huge experiment .
in the case of greece , 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- were pledged and about 40 billion have been paid .
the next installment ca n't be made because the country has n't completely fulfilled its obligations .
the next crisis is already on the horizon .
the safety net is beginning to tear .

deutsche welle spoke to the eu 's special envoy for myanmar , piero fassino . deutsche welle : myanmar 's military government released opposition leader aung san suu kyi after more than 15 years of detention .
how does the european union consider this move ? piero fassino : the most important thing , for her family and her people , is that aung san suu kyi is finally free .
what is also important is that she is enabled to come back to politics now , as myanmar is in a crucial and delicate phase .
elections have been held and a new parliament elected .
the new parliament will start working next february .
this will lead to a new civilian government , which should take over power from the military junta .
therefore , it could be the beginning of a period of political and institutional change and it is essential that suu kyi can participate as a major player in this new political phase . the recent elections were one step towards what the military rulers call " disciplined democracy . "
does the european union consider these elections to be truly democratic ? elections were held in a context that was strongly controlled and conditioned by the regime , according to dubious electoral laws and regulations , certainly not in line with european and international accepted standards . however , it needs also to be noted that during the electoral campaign civil society and opposition forces proved significantly lively .
it is also relevant that , notwithstanding all the existing obstacles , opposition parties registered for the elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icon suu kyi has promised to look into poll irregularities it will be very important to see the results .
depending on how many elected representatives from the opposition forces and ethnic groups win seats in the local and national parliaments , we will be able to give a more complete evaluation of these elections . burma is a very multiethnic society .
what position does the eu have about the ethnic minorities ' struggle for more autonomy ? the european union condemns any form of hostility and oppression against ethnic minorities .
in the framework of the current political transition , ethnic communities need to be fully associated to , and become part of , the political process . one of the essential issues to be dealt with in the context of the transition is precisely how to ensure the respect of the rights of the minorities , their autonomy and the possibility to participate in the life of the country without restraints . have the elections and the release of aung san suu kyi opened up a chance for a transformation process ? the release of aung san suu kyi is a first step .
now more steps into the right direction are needed : the release of all political detainees and the opening of a true , meaningful dialogue between the junta , the democratic opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities . in her first public speech after her release , aung san suu kyi explicitly urged the authorities to start a dialogue and expressed her availability to take up responsibilities in the management of the transition .
such a dialogue has to be free , honest and needs to aim at a definitive democratic transition allowing myanmar to reach those standards of freedom and democracy which are the mark of all free nations .
how will the eu press the government of myanmar towards a more pluralistic system ? we should not take anything for granted .
we certainly hope that the release of aung san suu kyi can open a door , and it is for this reason that we are asking , after her release , for more meaningful acts , clearly showing the will of the authorities for a democratic transition . bildunterschrift : fassino calls for more aid for cyclone-devastated areas the international community must keep myanmar as a priority on its political agenda and must accompany and assist the democratic transition .
therefore , we need a policy aimed at increasing our relations with myanmar . we must increase humanitarian assistance particularly in those areas devastated by the nargis typhoon , where reconstruction and rehabilitation is needed .
we must increase development aid in vital sectors for the burmese people , such as water , education , health and assistance to children .
we must also help civil society to structure itself and accompany myanmar in building up the democratic institutions that it has never had so far . interview : ana lehman editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german economics minister rainer bruederle said wednesday 's cabinet decision meant that subsidies for coal-mining would be " irreversibly " ended in 2018 , which represented " good news for the german taxpayer . "
the government said it was scrapping a planned review of the closure of its remaining mines .

this summer , the european commission proposed that all subsidies to unprofitable coal mines be scrapped by 2014 , arguing that the payments were bad for the environment and contravened eu competition regulations .
in response , chancellor angela merkel 's cabinet argued that an existing accord between the industry and the german government - foreseeing the 2018 closure - should be respected .

sources close to merkel 's government indicate that 23 other eu member states are in agreement with the german stance , with only sweden , denmark and the netherlands in favor of the commission 's plans .
the german coal industry employs around 25,000 people , mostly at mines in the country 's former industrial heartland in the west and southwest of the country .
without subsidies , expensive extraction methods make it impossible for german coal to compete on the international market .

sources close to merkel 's government indicate that 23 other eu member states are in agreement with the german stance , with only sweden , denmark and the netherlands in favor of the commission 's plans .
the german coal industry employs around 25,000 people , mostly at mines in the country 's former industrial heartland in the west and southwest of the country .
without subsidies , expensive extraction methods make it impossible for german coal to compete on the international market .

his survival will depend on what happens in confidence votes scheduled for early december . the latest italian drama began when deputy industry minister adolfo urso went on national television to announce he had resigned from prime minister silvio berlusconi 's center-right government , along with three other ministers .
" we propose a new government , a new majority , a new agenda for reform , " urso said .
" berlusconi is holing himself up in his palace like in a bunker . "
fed up with yet another berlusconi scandal involving young women and prostitutes , the leader 's former allies said they wanted to form a new center-right coalition with a new leader - one capable of addressing italy 's economic slowdown .
the four mps who resigned are supporters of parliamentary speaker gianfranco fini , a former ally of berlusconi turned rival .
they are part of fini 's new center-right splinter group called future and freedom .
for now , though , berlusconi remains in power - barely .
but barely has often been enough for italy 's richest man , who controls 90 percent of italian television and has vast holdings in newspapers and publishing companies .
he faces a confidence vote in both chambers of parliament on december 14 .
if he loses in either , he would be forced to resign and trigger early elections .
a strong grasp on power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finia was a neo-fascist turned mainstream conservative berlusconi said on wednesday he was confident he could win .
but most political experts expect him to be defeated in the lower house , where he no longer has a guaranteed majority since he split with fini last summer .
still , journalist christopher winner said it was unlikely berlusconi will go away without a ferocious political fight .
" it 's all about loyalty and the concept of betrayal ; it 's fairly straight-forward latin stuff , " said winner , the editor and italian political columnist for the rome-based the american magazine .
he added that despite berlusconi 's reputation as a corrupt buffoon outside italy , inside the country , the billionaire is still the most powerful person - and one who demands complete loyalty .
" he has tremendous power at almost every level of italian life , " winner said .
" it 's extremely possible that he 's warning some of the fini insiders that should they go through with their warning against him , they will pay in one way or another . "
population divided while support for berlusconi has weakened in parliament , italy 's population remains divided .
a poll published in the newspaper corriere della sera last weekend showed that 27 percent of italians said they 'd still vote for berlusconi 's people of freedom party .
it was followed by the center-left opposition democratic party at 24 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators have ridiculed berlusconi in past protests for his supporters , berlusconi has made a positive difference , especially in his response to emergencies like the flooding in the north and the earthquake in l 'aquila .
they said he has helped italy navigate the financial crisis .
others feel the time has come for a change .
they have grown weary of his raucous private life , which has distracted him from the country 's real problems .
the beginning of the end winner said despite berlusconi 's power , his days in politics are likely numbered .
" this is the end of the cycle , it 's only a matter of time , " winner said about the 74-year-old .
" the only thing that berlusconi wanted was to get through this mandate .
this was the last time around .
what 's galling him is that is being denied him , the chance of seeing through this legislature as he did the previous one and it 's coming from within his own party , which is absolutely and utterly intolerable to him . "
meanwhile , on the same day as the confidence votes , italy 's constitutional court is due to rule on whether berlusconi has to face trial over charges that he bribed british lawyer david mills to give false testimony to protect his business interests .
but italians know not to write berlusconi off too soon .
he has bounced back before , surviving a string of sex scandals and corruption accusations .
the votes in december will show whether the time has come for him to finally leave italy 's political stage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 17.11.2010 opinion : ireland needs to accept help the sooner , the better großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurozone finance ministers are taking a hard look at ireland , the latest member to come under intense bond market pressure .
dw 's bernd riegert believes ireland should accept aid - fast . the longer you wait , the more costly it gets .
in view of its rampant national debt and heavily indebted banks , ireland will have to accept help from the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
it is only a matter of days , maybe hours .
the eu finance ministers ' plans are ready , but ireland has so far steadfastly resisted applying for a state bailout .
this is a case of misplaced pride on the part of the country 's stricken prime minister , brian cowen .
the former celtic tiger is about to be skinned . cowen did not want to take responsibility for such action in front of his shaken voters .
he also fears the strict conditions that loans entail .
ireland would probably have to raise its extremely low corporate taxes and aggravate the economic crisis further still . every day of hesitation forces the cost of loans on the financial markets to skyrocket , while share prices drop . ireland 's finance minister has finally admitted that the problems seem to have become too big for the small country .
the crisis does not only affect ireland , it affects all of europe .
after all , the european central bank has tirelessly been pumping money into the irish budget , where it buys government bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoid a chain reaction ireland is as good as bankrupt and the eu 's larger member states , including britain that does not have the euro as its currency , will have to help the nation in order to protect their own interests .
ireland is indebted for the most part to britain , germany , the us and france .
an irish insolvency would hit the banks in europe : for instance germany 's state-run hre bank .
it is clearly in europe 's own interest to save ireland - the sooner , the better .
a chain reaction might still be averted , although portugal and possibly spain also stand on the edge of a precipice .
that is what european council president herman van rompuy must have had in mind when he said that the 16 states of the eurozone and the entire eu are fighting for survival .
it is alarming that the financial markets are reacting with a drop in the price of government bonds to chancellor angela merkel 's remarks that private investors should share the costs of state insolvencies after 2013 . debtors want to make money , but they do n't want to carry the risks , and that has to stop .
however , financial markets and investors currently still have the upper hand .
they act and politics is forced to react by using taxpayers ' money to buy time for bankrupt states .
in essence , that is what the bailout is : a safety net .
whether this structure will manage to stabilize the european currency and the financial system remains to be seen .
we are in the midst of a huge experiment .
in the case of greece , 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- were pledged and about 40 billion have been paid .
the next installment ca n't be made because the country has n't completely fulfilled its obligations .
the next crisis is already on the horizon .
the safety net is beginning to tear .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 17.11.2010 shale gas could ensure poland 's independence from russia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia often flexes its muscles over gas deliveries in winter winter is approaching - a time in which europe particularly feels russia 's grip on the energy market .
this power play has caused poland many headaches .
but new know-how in gas production could mark a turn in events . practically every winter , russia and its neighbors ukraine and belarus disagree on gas supply technicalities .
this dispute has endangered deliveries to poland .
the baltic sea pipeline , which will connect western european markets with major russian gas fields , has made matters worse .
warsaw 's politicians feel they will be at moscow 's mercy because russia can then shut off the supply without endangering its deliveries to germany .
but this headache could soon be over .
the largest deposits of shale gas in europe are assumed to be located on polish territory .
new technology from the united states could make it possible to exploit these gas reserves .
test drillings are planned all across the country .
according to geologists , poland could become the largest gas supplier in europe after norway and russia .
it would make the eastern european country rich - much richer than previously assumed , said energy expert pawel nierada from the sobieski institute in warsaw .
" conservative estimates already show that poland could suddenly become a serious exporter on the european gas market , " nierada said .
" the reserves exceed our country 's consumption many times over .
it 's hard to imagine what it would be like if the more optimistic estimates of the us government were to turn out to be true .
then , here in poland , we would have more gas than norway . "
skeptics question new technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland could soon control its own gas distribution natural gas which is produced in europe and asia has so far been relatively easy to access .
it lies in enormous bubbles under impermeable layers of earth , for example out of clay .
shale gas , on the other hand , is located in the middle of rock beds .
it 's nothing new that this valuable resource exists there .
but no one was ever interested in it before , because production was considered to be difficult and therefore uneconomical .
but that has changed .
in the united states , shale gas already covers 20 percent of gas consumption .
new technology used over the past few years has made this possible .
special drills first make their way into the ground vertically and then , when they reach the rock bed with the gas , bend into a horizontal position .
there , they pump a chemical liquid into the ground , which causes the rock bed to burst open .
the gas can then flow .
but many people are skeptical about this procedure , nierada said .
" there are also critical voices which say that the technology is still in its infancy - the experts from the russian gas company gazprom , for example , " he said .
" but in the united states , the production works .
and international firms believe it will be successful in poland , too .
otherwise , they would n't have already invested so much money in licenses and test drilling . "
the polish government has already issued some 60 licenses for test drillings , mainly to american companies .
it 's no wonder that this is cause for concern further to the east - in moscow .
after all , gas exports make up a significant part of russia 's gross domestic product .
they could stagnate or even decrease as a result of the polish finds .
gazprom has already admitted that it is n't able to sell as much to the united states as it used to because of the shale gas reserves there .
in a report , the company even said shale gas could " fundamentally change " the worldwide gas market .
us film highlights drawbacks us officials have billed shale gas a clean alternative , which could dominate the gas market by 2030 .
but despite its growing use there , shale gas extraction has caused controversy .
the hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , used to force out the gas has been a point of debate . earlier this year , the environmental protection agency asked gas companies to reveal what chemicals are used in deep extraction , addressing concerns by residents that the fracking had contaminated their drinking water . in the documentary " gasland , " which won the special jury prize at this year 's sundance film festival , filmmaker josh fox showed families in a drilling area whose tap water was even flammable . in addition , environmentalists have pointed out that the cleaner burning effects of shale gas were lessened when factoring in the energy expended to extract and transport it .
lack of political support production in poland could begin in ten years at the earliest , gas companies said .
but experts think it could start earlier .
then , the country could fulfill a dream it has had for hundreds of years : to be economically - and therefore also politically - independent from russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chevron is one of several us companies who have bought shale gas licenses in poland in spite of that , though , politicians across the spectrum have been slamming on the brakes , such as economics minister waldemar pawlak .
" up till now , shale gas has been more of a media phenomenon , " pawlak said .
" we still do n't know how difficult it will be to produce in poland .
it will also be more expensive than gas from conventional sources , because more drilling is necessary for the same amount of output . "
poland 's president bronislaw komorowski has been skeptical , too .
he said that all those production towers across the country would be an eyesore .
economic factors drive skepticism even if there are factual reasons for the skepticism , experts have long criticized polish politicians for being too passive .
for years , poland has relied on imports from russia without even considering the exploitation at least of conventional gas resources in the country .
this was mainly due to the monopoly of the state-owned gas firm pgnig .
" the company was never interested in producing gas itself , " nierada said .
" it earned its money very easily , after all , by buying gas from russia and simply adding its margin .
the company did n't care about how high the final price was . "
this passivity is now costing poland dearly .
in order to have enough gas for the coming winter , the state-owned company had to close a deal with gazprom for additional gas deliveries .
it even risked a battle with the eu commission , as brussels said russia was dictating unacceptable conditions .
the two sides finally reached an agreement at the end of october ensuring deliveries of russian natural gas until 2022 .
but such problems will possibly no longer exist in a few years - at least , not if poland turns into a european kuwait .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 17.11.2010 bankers warn against overregulation at euro finance week großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks say tighter regulations could make them less competitive german bankers meeting in frankfurt say tighter risk-management rules could undermine their ability to compete against asian lenders .
but the chief of the german central bank says banks should prepare for changes now . if there 's one thing the bankers and regulators gathered at the euro finance week in frankfurt agree on , it is that reform on a national level alone wo n't do much to stabilize the financial industry .
instead , they say that loopholes need to be plugged on an international level .
the german-centric economic forum started on monday , and there has been little doubt among attendees that action should be taken even before the stricter capital requirements of basel iii take effect in 2013 .
financial systems should be made more stable and resilient , they say .
german central bank president axel weber singled out german public-sector banks in his remarks .
" i believe , particularly in this sector , that the mikado-strategy that 's been pursued so far is leading nowhere , " weber said .
two such banks – bayernlb and westlb – recently failed in a merger attempt after receiving billions of taxpayer euros during the crisis .
the european commission set a new deadline of february 2011 for westlb to come up with ideas of how to sustain itself in the long term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels has given westlb a three-month deadline for restructuring weber said banks should n't be sluggish about making changes , and that they need to be proactive in preparing for coming regulations .
" changes will be coming to the market structure , " he said .
" there will be further changes .
the profiles of the actors will change , and the type and scope of the banking business will be affected .
" the refinancing structure of the banking system will change .
eventually there will also be less actors .
several will drop out – those which can not meet these new capital requirements . "
bankers have often complained about having to carry the high costs of the new regulations , but weber said that " a more stable financial system is worth the price . "
risks to international competition deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann spoke out against the notion of additional capital requirements for banks in germany , saying international competition is a concern .
what is needed is a method in which " banks which are a burden for the system – and therefore also taxpayers – can be eliminated , " he said .
" when you go to singapore , hong kong or shanghai today , then you experience what 's meant by location competition , " he said .
" and i believe we should always consider here what options we have to make the entire system more robust above all , but without giving up location advantages or tolerating location disadvantages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's ackermann defended big banking ackermann also defended large banking from skeptics who say banks were granted bailouts specifically because they had become too large to be allowed to fail .
" it is absolutely necessary that we define ourselves beyond national boundaries , " he said .
on monday a panel of economic journalists named ackermann ' european banker of the year ' for successfully leading his institution through the financial crisis .
asian banks ' ready ' according to wolfgang kirsch , ceo of dz bank , germany 's central cooperative bank , asian competitors are now primed and ready .
" after the asian crisis – this rough treatment which , in part , we 've been experiencing these days – this was something asian banks went through , " he said .
" and today they can happily call out , ' basel iii is n't an issue for us . '
anyone who says basel iii is n't an issue clearly has his own capital and liquidity .
and both of those things want to be utilized .
so we should keep an eye on that . "
the german central bank 's weber , however , foresees the need for regulation beyond just the banking system .
he said financial groups funneled billions of euros past regulators , agitating the financial crisis .
" we need to cast light into the shadows of the banking system , " he said .

but the chief of the german central bank says banks should prepare for changes now . if there 's one thing the bankers and regulators gathered at the euro finance week in frankfurt agree on , it is that reform on a national level alone wo n't do much to stabilize the financial industry .
instead , they say that loopholes need to be plugged on an international level .
the german-centric economic forum started on monday , and there has been little doubt among attendees that action should be taken even before the stricter capital requirements of basel iii take effect in 2013 .
financial systems should be made more stable and resilient , they say .
german central bank president axel weber singled out german public-sector banks in his remarks .
" i believe , particularly in this sector , that the mikado-strategy that 's been pursued so far is leading nowhere , " weber said .
two such banks – bayernlb and westlb – recently failed in a merger attempt after receiving billions of taxpayer euros during the crisis .
the european commission set a new deadline of february 2011 for westlb to come up with ideas of how to sustain itself in the long term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels has given westlb a three-month deadline for restructuring weber said banks should n't be sluggish about making changes , and that they need to be proactive in preparing for coming regulations .
" changes will be coming to the market structure , " he said .
" there will be further changes .
the profiles of the actors will change , and the type and scope of the banking business will be affected .
" the refinancing structure of the banking system will change .
eventually there will also be less actors .
several will drop out – those which can not meet these new capital requirements . "
bankers have often complained about having to carry the high costs of the new regulations , but weber said that " a more stable financial system is worth the price . "
risks to international competition deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann spoke out against the notion of additional capital requirements for banks in germany , saying international competition is a concern .
what is needed is a method in which " banks which are a burden for the system – and therefore also taxpayers – can be eliminated , " he said .
" when you go to singapore , hong kong or shanghai today , then you experience what 's meant by location competition , " he said .
" and i believe we should always consider here what options we have to make the entire system more robust above all , but without giving up location advantages or tolerating location disadvantages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's ackermann defended big banking ackermann also defended large banking from skeptics who say banks were granted bailouts specifically because they had become too large to be allowed to fail .
" it is absolutely necessary that we define ourselves beyond national boundaries , " he said .
on monday a panel of economic journalists named ackermann ' european banker of the year ' for successfully leading his institution through the financial crisis .
asian banks ' ready ' according to wolfgang kirsch , ceo of dz bank , germany 's central cooperative bank , asian competitors are now primed and ready .
" after the asian crisis – this rough treatment which , in part , we 've been experiencing these days – this was something asian banks went through , " he said .
" and today they can happily call out , ' basel iii is n't an issue for us . '
anyone who says basel iii is n't an issue clearly has his own capital and liquidity .
and both of those things want to be utilized .
so we should keep an eye on that . "
the german central bank 's weber , however , foresees the need for regulation beyond just the banking system .
he said financial groups funneled billions of euros past regulators , agitating the financial crisis .
" we need to cast light into the shadows of the banking system , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 17.11.2010 eu , imf head to ireland for bailout talks amid fears for future of euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure is growing on ireland to accept assistance an eu / imf mission will be arriving in ireland on thursday to discuss a potential bailout of the severely indebted country .
the former celtic tiger , meanwhile , insists it does n't need to be rescued . europe edged closer to its second bailout of a eurozone state on wednesday , as the bloc 's finance ministers announced a joint mission with the imf to ireland directed at stepping up talks on its devastated banking sector .
" the situation is very pressing and very , very serious and we do n't have any time to waste , " eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters after meetings in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they are talks , not bailout negotiations : lenihan " it is essential that confidence in the irish banking sector is restored for the sake of financial stability in europe and for the sake of restoring confidence in the economy . "
irish finance minister brian lenihan confirmed that the emergency talks would begin in dublin on thursday but issued no details on what shape the bailout could take or its possible size .
" we have agreed to look at the structural problems in the irish banks in the light of recent market pressures and assess what needs to be done because banking questions are technical and difficult , " lenihan told irish state radio on wednesday .
dublin reluctant to become ' europe 's lackey ' according to an article published in the wall street journal on wednesday , the irish banking sector is up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering for themselves .
investors fear the final figure could be even higher given rising mortgage arrears , deposit outflows and higher funding costs .
nevertheless , irish leaders continue to refuse that neither the country nor its banks are in need of a bailout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish do n't want to beg like the orphan , oliver twist " what we want to concentrate on now is in a focused way , over coming days , to sit down and see in what way can assistance be provided to ensure that these issues can be dealt with properly and appropriately , " prime minister brian cowen told parliament on wednesday after news of thursday 's emergency talks had emerged .
" there has been no question of the government -lsb- being -rsb- in a negotiation for a bailout , " he said , dismissing the term as pejorative and referring to the fact that the state of ireland is pre-funded until the middle of next year .
meanwhile , the irish people share their prime minister 's resistance to financial assistance from brussels or anywhere else ; in the streets of the irish capital , a european bailout would be a downright " humiliation . "
sean , a 54-year-old , called it " the final insult to the good and decent people of this country , to go like a beggar in brussels and ask that very seasonal question - please sir , can i have some more ? " referring to the charles dickens character oliver twist .
another dubliner , adam , 42 , said it would be " the end of the independent irish republic . "
" i would rather be poor and free than a poor lackey of europe .
it 's time to stand up and be irish once again , " he added .
more eu members to require assistance ?
also on wednesday , eu finance ministers pledged to agree on stricter debt rules by mid-2011 , as well as on a new rescue fund for dangerously indebted countries such as greece - which received substantial eu funds earlier this year to avoid bankruptcy - and a number of other eurozone members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von rompuy : resolution of the crisis is critical for the eu portugal and spain , which are already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , have both alluded to budgetary difficulties .
as with ireland , however , there have been no requests for emergency funding as of yet .
but the ministers gave a clear signal that " determined and coordinated " action had to be taken to resolve the debt crisis that is threatening the future financial stability of europe and the 16-member , single-currency eurozone .
" if we do n't survive with the eurozone we will not survive with the european union , " european council president herman von rompuy said .

deutsche welle spoke to the eu 's special envoy for myanmar , piero fassino . deutsche welle : myanmar 's military government released opposition leader aung san suu kyi after more than 15 years of detention .
how does the european union consider this move ? piero fassino : the most important thing , for her family and her people , is that aung san suu kyi is finally free .
what is also important is that she is enabled to come back to politics now , as myanmar is in a crucial and delicate phase .
elections have been held and a new parliament elected .
the new parliament will start working next february .
this will lead to a new civilian government , which should take over power from the military junta .
therefore , it could be the beginning of a period of political and institutional change and it is essential that suu kyi can participate as a major player in this new political phase . the recent elections were one step towards what the military rulers call " disciplined democracy . "
does the european union consider these elections to be truly democratic ? elections were held in a context that was strongly controlled and conditioned by the regime , according to dubious electoral laws and regulations , certainly not in line with european and international accepted standards . however , it needs also to be noted that during the electoral campaign civil society and opposition forces proved significantly lively .
it is also relevant that , notwithstanding all the existing obstacles , opposition parties registered for the elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icon suu kyi has promised to look into poll irregularities it will be very important to see the results .
depending on how many elected representatives from the opposition forces and ethnic groups win seats in the local and national parliaments , we will be able to give a more complete evaluation of these elections . burma is a very multiethnic society .
what position does the eu have about the ethnic minorities ' struggle for more autonomy ? the european union condemns any form of hostility and oppression against ethnic minorities .
in the framework of the current political transition , ethnic communities need to be fully associated to , and become part of , the political process . one of the essential issues to be dealt with in the context of the transition is precisely how to ensure the respect of the rights of the minorities , their autonomy and the possibility to participate in the life of the country without restraints . have the elections and the release of aung san suu kyi opened up a chance for a transformation process ? the release of aung san suu kyi is a first step .
now more steps into the right direction are needed : the release of all political detainees and the opening of a true , meaningful dialogue between the junta , the democratic opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities . in her first public speech after her release , aung san suu kyi explicitly urged the authorities to start a dialogue and expressed her availability to take up responsibilities in the management of the transition .
such a dialogue has to be free , honest and needs to aim at a definitive democratic transition allowing myanmar to reach those standards of freedom and democracy which are the mark of all free nations .
how will the eu press the government of myanmar towards a more pluralistic system ? we should not take anything for granted .
we certainly hope that the release of aung san suu kyi can open a door , and it is for this reason that we are asking , after her release , for more meaningful acts , clearly showing the will of the authorities for a democratic transition . bildunterschrift : fassino calls for more aid for cyclone-devastated areas the international community must keep myanmar as a priority on its political agenda and must accompany and assist the democratic transition .
therefore , we need a policy aimed at increasing our relations with myanmar . we must increase humanitarian assistance particularly in those areas devastated by the nargis typhoon , where reconstruction and rehabilitation is needed .
we must increase development aid in vital sectors for the burmese people , such as water , education , health and assistance to children .
we must also help civil society to structure itself and accompany myanmar in building up the democratic institutions that it has never had so far . interview : ana lehman editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most meet their husbands through marriage agencies . one vietnamese woman at the shelter , who seems to be in her early 20s , asks to be called hong . she recalls the day when a marriage broker knocked at her family ’ s door : " the madam came to all the homes in my neighborhood , trying to find women to marry south korean men .
she persuaded me .
at first my family was against my doing this , but i decided it was best for me to go to south korea . " even worse than imagined hong was married to a korean man just one day after meeting him .

during one fight , he even pulled a knife on her .
the police were called and hong was taken to the shelter . hong claims the marriage agency , which introduced her to her husband covered up his drinking and lied about his income and housing situation . women are treated as sex slaves that 's not at all unusual , says a catholic nun who helps run the shelter .
she doesn ’ t give her name out of fear for the safety of the women living there . " these women from southeast asia are very poor and have no voice , " she points out .

" it is not cause and should not be cause for us to change our daily lives totally , " the minister said , comparing the situation to the security alarm surrounding germany 's federal elections in 2009 .
de maiziere said " a tip from an international partner after the yemen incident " alerted the interior ministry to the potential threat .
past threats from yemen earlier this month , the discovery of two us-bound parcel bombs sent via airmail from yemen raised new fears about security .
the parcel bombs coincided with package bombs sent by greek militants to chancellor angela merkel in berlin .
the german government responded by grounding all cargo planes originating from yemen , a ban that has since been lifted .
in october , de maiziere drew criticism after he warned against " alarmism " in the wake of travel alerts for europe issued by the united states , britain and japan .

two new studies say the country is n't doing enough to attract foreign talent and should do more to promote a " welcoming culture . " germany is only a moderately attractive destination for skilled immigrants , according to two recently released studies .
the conclusion of one of the studies , conducted by the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , is that the federal government is doing too little to attract qualified professionals from other countries .
" skilled professionals and students are n't waiting in line to bring their abilities to germany , " dihk president hans heinrich driftmann told the frankfurter rundschau newspaper , adding , " this should worry us . "
according to one survey of 47 chambers of foreign trade , germany earned an attractiveness score of 2.8 , with one signifying " attractive " and five meaning " unattractive . "
the report states that germany needs to work on promoting a " welcoming culture , " according to the frankfurter rundschau , which published the findings of the report prior to its release .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : driftmann says germany should reduce red tape qualified young turks living in germany were reported to feel undesired , while polish professionals in germany complained they were confronted by stereotypes casting them as " asparagus cutters and farming assistants . "
' sprechen sie deutsch ? '
according to the report , germany 's main problem in attracting skilled immigrants is its language .
german , it claims , is faring poorly internationally when compared to english or french .
the dihk blamed the problem on cuts to funding for the goethe institute , an organization that promotes the german language worldwide .
the german academic exchange service , which promotes foreign students coming to germany , also faced limited resources . the report also extended its criticism to the red tape surrounding visas and work permits in germany , which it said were complicated and confusing - and inconsistent from one jurisdiction to the next .
it further stated that over half a dozen eu member states regularly complained that their qualifications and professional degrees were not recognized in germany .
lowering the hurdles the dihk found a practice requiring foreign students to procure work permits and jobs within a year in germany to be counterproductive .
it said that this practice had led many qualified students to leave germany during the recent financial crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of executives and scholars leave germany every year the report recommended lowering the hurdles for foreign professionals to work in germany - at least for engineers and it workers .
the dihk also wants to see one regulation changed that automatically grants foreigners the right to settle in germany if they earn 66,000 euros -lrb- $ 89,100 -rrb- a year .
the chamber of commerce wants resident rights granted to immigrants who earn 40,000 euros or more .
the bottom line , according to driftmann , is that germany must be more welcoming to prospective immigrants .
only ' second-best ' the same could have been the credo of another study , conducted by the bib , a federal institute in the western city of wiesbaden , which studies germany 's population .
the institute 's study , which focuses on highly-qualified professional immigrants , concluded that germany was not a first-choice destination , but rather seen as a second- or third-best option .
the study , commissioned by the bertelsmann foundation , concluded that , between 2005 and 2009 , germany had lost around 1,500 executives and scholars yearly to other european union countries . nations like sweden , spain , austria , the united kingdom and belgium were much more attractive destinations for skilled workers , it said .
it remains unclear whether the opening of the german labor market to citizens of eastern eu states next year will change the situation , according to gunter thielen , chairman of the bertelsmann foundation 's board of directors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thielen says germany can learn from canada and sweden " we can look at other societies with successful immigration policies and adopt the best parts of their systems , " he said .
the bertelsmann foundation recommended taking aspects of the canadian or british models , which focus on immigrants ' qualifications and combining them with the swedish system , which is focused directly on the requirements of the labor market .

deutsche welle spoke to the eu 's special envoy for myanmar , piero fassino . deutsche welle : myanmar 's military government released opposition leader aung san suu kyi after more than 15 years of detention .
how does the european union consider this move ? piero fassino : the most important thing , for her family and her people , is that aung san suu kyi is finally free .
what is also important is that she is enabled to come back to politics now , as myanmar is in a crucial and delicate phase .
elections have been held and a new parliament elected .
the new parliament will start working next february .
this will lead to a new civilian government , which should take over power from the military junta .
therefore , it could be the beginning of a period of political and institutional change and it is essential that suu kyi can participate as a major player in this new political phase . the recent elections were one step towards what the military rulers call " disciplined democracy . "
does the european union consider these elections to be truly democratic ? elections were held in a context that was strongly controlled and conditioned by the regime , according to dubious electoral laws and regulations , certainly not in line with european and international accepted standards . however , it needs also to be noted that during the electoral campaign civil society and opposition forces proved significantly lively .

what position does the eu have about the ethnic minorities ' struggle for more autonomy ? the european union condemns any form of hostility and oppression against ethnic minorities .
in the framework of the current political transition , ethnic communities need to be fully associated to , and become part of , the political process . one of the essential issues to be dealt with in the context of the transition is precisely how to ensure the respect of the rights of the minorities , their autonomy and the possibility to participate in the life of the country without restraints . have the elections and the release of aung san suu kyi opened up a chance for a transformation process ? the release of aung san suu kyi is a first step .
now more steps into the right direction are needed : the release of all political detainees and the opening of a true , meaningful dialogue between the junta , the democratic opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities . in her first public speech after her release , aung san suu kyi explicitly urged the authorities to start a dialogue and expressed her availability to take up responsibilities in the management of the transition .
such a dialogue has to be free , honest and needs to aim at a definitive democratic transition allowing myanmar to reach those standards of freedom and democracy which are the mark of all free nations .
how will the eu press the government of myanmar towards a more pluralistic system ? we should not take anything for granted .

both proponents and detractors are claiming to represent the interests of poor farmers . the mexican government first lifted its ban on experimental crops of genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- maize last year , freeing the way for field trials in the country where the crop was first domesticated . but , much like in europe where opposition to cultivating genetically modified crops has been strong , some small-scale farmers and environmental protection groups have criticized the government 's decision to add modified crops to the roughly 60 types of maize traditionally cultivated in mexico . for family farmers like rogelio sanchez , who lives in the village vicente guerrero , maize is more than just a crop and deserves to be protected from genetic alteration . " maize is sacred to us , " he said of the staple that has been cultivated in mexico for some 7,000 years .
" it 's the foundation of our diet and a part of our cultural identity that we inherited from our forefathers . " conflicting interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 60 sorts of maize cultivated in mexico a village of about 200 families , mostly working one-to-two-hectare subsistence farms , together with a group of farmers in vicente guerrero have joined forces to promote traditional farming methods that call for natural seeds , composting and no pesticides . the group 's agricultural methods are a far cry from the kind of agriculture being trialed in mexico 's north , although the government has n't yet given the green light to commercial production of gm maize , as it already has for genetically modified cotton . the modified maize would help farmers - especially cash-strapped small-time farmers - increase the size of their harvests without significantly increasing costs , according to ariel alvarez of mexico 's inter-secretarial commission on biosafety of genetically modified organisms -lrb- cibiogem -rrb- . " some people call it genetic contamination , but others say that this gene can help the people who need it most : small-time farmers , " he said . " the farmers who do n't have the money to buy pesticides and end up losing half of their harvests could benefit .
are we going to call that contamination ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters say gm maize would increase harvest sizes calming fears to help calm people 's fears about gm crops , alvarez and other officials recently opened the commission 's doors to inform the public and take questions . one of their arguments is that the government does not force farmers to buy and use the modified seeds sold by monsanto and other companies . the commission also claims that more research into genetically modified crops is necessary , and that it could become a substantial source of future income and transform mexico from a niche market into a global player . aleira lara of the environmental protection group greenpeace has , however , warned that the government risks opening a pandora 's box , because it is not known how the gm crops will affect indigenous varieties of maize . she added that mexico , the birthplace of corn crops , was a valuable country for biotech companies trying to win over regulators to their cause . " mexico is a symbol for monsanto , " she said .
" if they get permission for genetically modified maize here , it 's like a springboard for other countries where there has been opposition .

many countries use similar warning systems , first developed in the us . terror alert levels reflect the existing threat of an imminent terrorist attack , though such danger can hardly be measured .
the us department of homeland security developed such an advisory system following the september 11 attacks .
authorities raise the threat level to " high " - or in the worst case " severe " - if they receive pertinent information from their own intelligence service or other security authorities .
they also rely on intelligence data from other countries they work closely with .
this can involve tapped conversations , respective information in the internet or credible leads from informants in the jihadist scene .
it is very rarely based on a concrete lead .
members of german intelligence services recently questioned islamists in afghanistan for an entire week about terror scenarios in germany and europe .
according to security authorities , some 40 islamists from germany are currently residing in pakistan and afghanistan .
at the same time , around 200 specialists from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- have continued to work on verifying whether the latest terror warnings from the us are true .
this includes intensifying the surveillance of some 130 so-called " endangerers " living in germany .
various degrees of security measures normally , a collection of several indicators form a qualitative new threat situation .
this can result in a concrete terror alert officially announced to the public , in turn generally leading to increased controls at critical points in a country 's security structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere said new , tangible intelligence has come to light in germany , the federal interior minister and his counterparts in the individual states are responsible for this move .
the scope of possible measures to resort to range from ordering increased passenger and luggage controls at airports , monitoring train stations and major road junctions to temporarily closing embassies at particularly vulnerable locations .
in the united states , the government set up the five-tiered color-coded threat level system to protect against future accusations that security authorities did n't take information about the imminent 9/11 attacks seriously enough and inform the public .
germany 's interior minister thomas de maiziere probably had similar thoughts in his mind .
continual warnings last month , authorities discovered two us-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen , one of which went through cologne-bonn airport in western germany undetected .
it turned out that lufthansa had already tipped off the interior ministry about the terrorist threat from yemen .
the airline 's warning reportedly reached de maiziere already at the beginning of october - three weeks before the package bombs were found in europe .
in recent weeks , german media have also repeatedly reported on alleged imminent terrorist attacks in the us and europe .
in addition , there have been continual warnings by western intelligence services that terrorists could plan an attack still before christmas - though the al qaeda network has in the past liked to publicly spread such warnings for propaganda purposes .
other governments have also reacted with official terror warnings to the supposed changed security situation .
germany is the third eu nation after britain and france to announce such a warning to its population .

among other things , vasconcelos addressed the outlook for european engagement in afghanistan .
deutsche welle : the war in afghanistan is now in its ninth year and the original goal of establishing a democracy there is all but gone .
europeans have been deeply skeptical of the afghan mission for a long time .
could europe do more in afghanistan ?
alvaro de vasconcelos : we can do more .
but to do more we should do it in a civilian way .
we are going to have the nato summit in a few days and the temptation will be to say the civilian training in afghanistan must be done by nato itself because the europeans are not doing as much as necessary and the americans will essentially work through nato .
i think this is as mistake .
because this will make civilians become part of a military operation .
we need to delink the civilian from the military .
of course the military is needed to guarantee the protection of the civilian training .
but we need to train the police in a different way then we train the military .
the police are trained to protect people , so we need to move toward this core aspect - human security and strategy where the main objective is to protect the civilians in afghanistan and not to kill the enemy .
because as president obama from day one said we should not be in afghanistan to kill civilians , but to protect them .
do you think europeans would support sending more police trainers to afghanistan ?
i think if there is a clear shift in the strategy in afghanistan in that we say we are not there to win a war , we are there to build an afghan state , an afghan army , an afghan police force , this would be welcome , because the people in europe want their soldiers home .
most public opinion polls in europe show that the majority of people want their soldiers back as soon as possible .
so if you devise a strategy that will bring your troops home - which is what president obama has announced - and you show that this is a crisis management and state-building operation that involves the united nations to a larger degree , that will get much more support in europe .
there has been a lot of debate in the past years whether or not the west should talk to the taliban .
what is your opinion ?
my sense is that there is more or less a consensus now in europe , and i think also in the united states , that there is a need for a political process .
you can speak about talking to taliban in two ways : one is to say we are talking with the good taliban .
we would then be dividing the taliban leadership by talking to local leaders and this would be a kind of counterinsurgency strategy .
this was used in iraq .
but the essential problem is that the taliban leadership will still be there and will still have a lot of support in some areas of the country and it will still be able to make war and create enormous difficulties to the international coalition . the other is to start communication at the highest level of the taliban in afghanistan .
but if you -lrb- do that , -rrb- the biggest difficulty is to decide what we want from them .
are we prepared to have the taliban in power again in kabul ?
what would be the impact of that in international public opinion - but especially in europe and the united states ?
the role of president karzai is a very contentious issue , which came up again recently after he confirmed reports that he was regularly accepting large sums of cash from iran .
is karzai for europe and the us still the best option to lead afghanistan ?
so far he is the only option .
no one has found a better option for afghanistan up to now .
we know that the elections were not very transparent and that it is important now to establish legitimacy and credibility .
but karzai is in power now , the election results were accepted after lots of doubts , and the europeans and the americans as well as the international community are now working with him .
and he is a very skillfull politician with many connections in afghanistan and he knows the country well , so he can start the process of talking with the taliban .
so he certainly is and will be playing an important political role .

among other things , vasconcelos addressed the outlook for european engagement in afghanistan .
deutsche welle : the war in afghanistan is now in its ninth year and the original goal of establishing a democracy there is all but gone .
europeans have been deeply skeptical of the afghan mission for a long time .
could europe do more in afghanistan ?
alvaro de vasconcelos : we can do more .
but to do more we should do it in a civilian way .
we are going to have the nato summit in a few days and the temptation will be to say the civilian training in afghanistan must be done by nato itself because the europeans are not doing as much as necessary and the americans will essentially work through nato .
i think this is as mistake .
because this will make civilians become part of a military operation .
we need to delink the civilian from the military .
of course the military is needed to guarantee the protection of the civilian training .
but we need to train the police in a different way then we train the military .
the police are trained to protect people , so we need to move toward this core aspect - human security and strategy where the main objective is to protect the civilians in afghanistan and not to kill the enemy .
because as president obama from day one said we should not be in afghanistan to kill civilians , but to protect them .

many countries use similar warning systems , first developed in the us . terror alert levels reflect the existing threat of an imminent terrorist attack , though such danger can hardly be measured .
the us department of homeland security developed such an advisory system following the september 11 attacks .
authorities raise the threat level to " high " - or in the worst case " severe " - if they receive pertinent information from their own intelligence service or other security authorities .
they also rely on intelligence data from other countries they work closely with .
this can involve tapped conversations , respective information in the internet or credible leads from informants in the jihadist scene .
it is very rarely based on a concrete lead .
members of german intelligence services recently questioned islamists in afghanistan for an entire week about terror scenarios in germany and europe .
according to security authorities , some 40 islamists from germany are currently residing in pakistan and afghanistan .
at the same time , around 200 specialists from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- have continued to work on verifying whether the latest terror warnings from the us are true .
this includes intensifying the surveillance of some 130 so-called " endangerers " living in germany .
various degrees of security measures normally , a collection of several indicators form a qualitative new threat situation .
this can result in a concrete terror alert officially announced to the public , in turn generally leading to increased controls at critical points in a country 's security structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere said new , tangible intelligence has come to light in germany , the federal interior minister and his counterparts in the individual states are responsible for this move .
the scope of possible measures to resort to range from ordering increased passenger and luggage controls at airports , monitoring train stations and major road junctions to temporarily closing embassies at particularly vulnerable locations .
in the united states , the government set up the five-tiered color-coded threat level system to protect against future accusations that security authorities did n't take information about the imminent 9/11 attacks seriously enough and inform the public .
germany 's interior minister thomas de maiziere probably had similar thoughts in his mind .
continual warnings last month , authorities discovered two us-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen , one of which went through cologne-bonn airport in western germany undetected .
it turned out that lufthansa had already tipped off the interior ministry about the terrorist threat from yemen .
the airline 's warning reportedly reached de maiziere already at the beginning of october - three weeks before the package bombs were found in europe .
in recent weeks , german media have also repeatedly reported on alleged imminent terrorist attacks in the us and europe .
in addition , there have been continual warnings by western intelligence services that terrorists could plan an attack still before christmas - though the al qaeda network has in the past liked to publicly spread such warnings for propaganda purposes .
other governments have also reacted with official terror warnings to the supposed changed security situation .
germany is the third eu nation after britain and france to announce such a warning to its population .

security is to be increased at all airports and train stations . germany 's interior minister has announced that security is being stepped up at airports and train stations across the country .
thomas de maiziere told reporters in berlin on wednesday that the move came in light of concrete information received , indicating that a terrorist attack was being planned for the end of november in germany .
" from today , there will be a visible police presence .
i thought it should be explained to citizens , " de maiziere said .
" there is reason for concern , but no reason for hysteria . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere : ' reason for concern , not hysteria ' de maiziere called on all citizens to be vigilant .
any unattended packages or bags should be reported to security officials . the increased alert applied to all of germany .
three scenarios the government did not provide any details , but security officials in berlin said three suspected threats had arisen . speaking on condition of anonymity , the officials said one involved senior al qaeda leader younis al mauretani , who was planning an operation against europe and the united states . the second involved a plot to carry out coordinated armed attacks similar to those that killed 166 people in the indian city of mumbai in 2008 .
indications emerged that between 15 and 25 militants were lying in wait in europe preparing for such a strike , potentially in germany , the officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the scenarios resembles the 2008 attacks in mumbai a third scenario pointed to sleeper cells already in germany , though no specific targets were identified . although the evidence pointed to a real threat , de maiziere called on germans to avoid overreating . " it is not cause and should not be cause for us to change our daily lives totally , " the minister said , comparing the situation to the security alarm surrounding germany 's federal elections in 2009 .
de maiziere said " a tip from an international partner after the yemen incident " alerted the interior ministry to the potential threat .
past threats from yemen earlier this month , the discovery of two us-bound parcel bombs sent via airmail from yemen raised new fears about security .
the parcel bombs coincided with package bombs sent by greek militants to chancellor angela merkel in berlin .
the german government responded by grounding all cargo planes originating from yemen , a ban that has since been lifted .
in october , de maiziere drew criticism after he warned against " alarmism " in the wake of travel alerts for europe issued by the united states , britain and japan .

deutsche welle spoke to the eu 's special envoy for myanmar , piero fassino . deutsche welle : myanmar 's military government released opposition leader aung san suu kyi after more than 15 years of detention .
how does the european union consider this move ? piero fassino : the most important thing , for her family and her people , is that aung san suu kyi is finally free .
what is also important is that she is enabled to come back to politics now , as myanmar is in a crucial and delicate phase .
elections have been held and a new parliament elected .
the new parliament will start working next february .
this will lead to a new civilian government , which should take over power from the military junta .
therefore , it could be the beginning of a period of political and institutional change and it is essential that suu kyi can participate as a major player in this new political phase . the recent elections were one step towards what the military rulers call " disciplined democracy . "
does the european union consider these elections to be truly democratic ? elections were held in a context that was strongly controlled and conditioned by the regime , according to dubious electoral laws and regulations , certainly not in line with european and international accepted standards . however , it needs also to be noted that during the electoral campaign civil society and opposition forces proved significantly lively .
it is also relevant that , notwithstanding all the existing obstacles , opposition parties registered for the elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icon suu kyi has promised to look into poll irregularities it will be very important to see the results .
depending on how many elected representatives from the opposition forces and ethnic groups win seats in the local and national parliaments , we will be able to give a more complete evaluation of these elections . burma is a very multiethnic society .
what position does the eu have about the ethnic minorities ' struggle for more autonomy ? the european union condemns any form of hostility and oppression against ethnic minorities .
in the framework of the current political transition , ethnic communities need to be fully associated to , and become part of , the political process . one of the essential issues to be dealt with in the context of the transition is precisely how to ensure the respect of the rights of the minorities , their autonomy and the possibility to participate in the life of the country without restraints . have the elections and the release of aung san suu kyi opened up a chance for a transformation process ? the release of aung san suu kyi is a first step .
now more steps into the right direction are needed : the release of all political detainees and the opening of a true , meaningful dialogue between the junta , the democratic opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities . in her first public speech after her release , aung san suu kyi explicitly urged the authorities to start a dialogue and expressed her availability to take up responsibilities in the management of the transition .
such a dialogue has to be free , honest and needs to aim at a definitive democratic transition allowing myanmar to reach those standards of freedom and democracy which are the mark of all free nations .
how will the eu press the government of myanmar towards a more pluralistic system ? we should not take anything for granted .
we certainly hope that the release of aung san suu kyi can open a door , and it is for this reason that we are asking , after her release , for more meaningful acts , clearly showing the will of the authorities for a democratic transition . bildunterschrift : fassino calls for more aid for cyclone-devastated areas the international community must keep myanmar as a priority on its political agenda and must accompany and assist the democratic transition .
therefore , we need a policy aimed at increasing our relations with myanmar . we must increase humanitarian assistance particularly in those areas devastated by the nargis typhoon , where reconstruction and rehabilitation is needed .
we must increase development aid in vital sectors for the burmese people , such as water , education , health and assistance to children .
we must also help civil society to structure itself and accompany myanmar in building up the democratic institutions that it has never had so far . interview : ana lehman editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no !
as dw reporter ali almakhlafi discovered , digital sheep are getting more and more popular . blood and dead sheep everywhere ?
spellbound pilgrims slaughtering live animals by the dozen ? that 's how a friend of mine imagined the feast of sacrifice .
and maybe some of dw 's readers thought so as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multicultural mecca : pilgrims from chad , china , lebanon , brazil , and austria i ca n't say that animal rights activists and vegetarians would enjoy what 's happening here – but the feast of sacrifice in mina is n't massacre-like , as my friend expected .
in accordance with islamic tradition , the sacrificial animals are slaughtered by a method called thaliba : their throats are cut and they bleed dry .
usually , this is done by a butcher or under professional instruction in one of the big butcheries .
the animals are definitively not being slaughtered on market squares , or even in front of a mosque .
the ritual took place on tuesday , november 16 , when muslims celebrated the feast of sacrifice .
however , animals are also sacrificed on the following two days of the hajj .
so far , however , i have n't seen any blood .
and that 's due to a new trend , which is quite popular in mecca , but also among turkish and arabic muslims living in germany : instead of sacrificing a real sheep , they sacrifice digital sheep - also called an electronic sheep or an e-sheep . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this sign indicates : ' no stone throwing ' i know it sounds funny , but it 's actually quite reasonable if you think about it .
on the one hand , muslims are supposed to sacrifice an animal during the hajj and then give the meat to the poor and needy .
on the other hand , there are n't all that many needy people in saudi arabia , at least not compared with other parts of the world , such as africa .
the idea is , you pay 400 rial -lrb- 80 euros -rrb- to a charitable foundation online , thereby purchasing a digital sheep .
the foundation will then make sure that a real sheep is slaughtered , and the meat is given to needy people in the respective country .
" i think that 's a great idea , " a saudi pilgrim tells me .
" what should we do with all the meat in our fridges ?
there are people who need it much more than we do . "
throwing stones at satan i 'm here as a journalist , so i did n't slaughter a sheep , not even a digital one .
but i wanted to at least stone the devil .
again , that all happened symbolically . on the hajj , pilgrims stone the devil numerous times .
it 's an important ritual , not only on the feast of sacrifice .
when throwing a stone , pilgrims speak out loud : " in the name of god , god is great . "
by doing so , they 're asking for god 's forgiveness for their sins .
the pilgrims have collected the stones they throw in the valley of muzdalifah .
2 million pilgrims arriving in mecca with 49 pebble stones each – that adds up to some 300 tons of stone .
after the hajj , saudi authorities make sure that the stones are transported back to muzdalifah .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i succeeded at ' stoning the devil ' a wall at one of the three pillars of jamarat bridge symbolizes the devil .
in fact , the huge bridge is a blessing for the hajj .
a couple of years ago , it was reconstructed as a five-story building with the help of german engineers .
now it 's a lot bigger , and also safer than before .
since it was rebuilt there have been no mass panics causing causalties , like there used to be .
a hair for every sin when the feast of sacrifice is over , pilgrims leave the state of consecration .
that was when i meet aaron from indonesia , who was holding scissors in his hand .
along with many other men here , he was about to have his head shaven .
shaving , or at least cutting ones hair , is an important part of the hajj .
i asked aaron why he wants to have his head shaven instead of just cutting off a little of his hair .
he said : " every hair on my head represents a sin to me .
and having my head shaved completely , it 's like being a newborn child – free of sins . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aaron from indonesia by the way , i discovered a funny aspect to the ritual .
there are , of course , men who have a bald head in the first place .
they either prefer a bald head or they lost their hair for some reason .
however , many of those men have their heads shaven symbolically , even though there 's really nothing to shave .
after the ritual , pilgrims take off their hajj garment and put on their everyday clothes .
and so i put on my jeans and polo shirt once again .
hajj attire " made in china " you might not have thought about the fact that many of the hajj clothes in mecca bear the label " made in china , " but they do .
muhammad , a pilgrim from china , told me that – and he 's very proud of it .
he 's part of the muslim minority in his country , which is even suppressed to some extent .
but muhammad still feels like a real chinese .
he told me he wished china would become the " world champion of global economy , " well , i guess china is heading in the right direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammad is proud that many hajj clothes are made in china again and again , i 'm excited by the international atmosphere over here .
i 'd like to answer a question posted by dw user detlev abebe , who wants to know : " what 's you 're impression of the majority of pilgrims ?
are they open-minded and tolerant – or do they just stick to a fixed ideology ? "
i would say it 's the former .
i definitely have n't seen anybody holding a fundamentalist speech in public .
most of the people here are just happy to experience a highly significant religious event together with pilgrims from around the world .
of course , the official saudi interpretation of islam is something different .
it 's very conservative , indeed .
yet , i 'm also surprised by how the conservative regulations are handled over here .
for example , there are rather strict rules for how men and women should interact with each other .
but they are n't taken that seriously by many pilgrims - especially when they 're not in public places .
and here 's another rather peculiar example : it 's illegal to sell cigarettes in mecca , but it 's allowed to smoke .
unveiled women i have n't found a definite answer to a question posted by dw user " milena " : " why is it that women are n't allowed to wear veils during the pilgrimage ? "
apparently , the rule says that women 's faces need to be recognizable during the hajj .
a religious scholar here told me that it probably goes back to how the prophets ' wives used to dress .
they were n't wearing veils .
and i personally think it could be a good sign that veils are n't a matter of religion , but a matter of tradition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 17.11.2010 eu , imf head to ireland for bailout talks amid fears for future of euro großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure is growing on ireland to accept assistance an eu / imf mission will be arriving in ireland on thursday to discuss a potential bailout of the severely indebted country .
the former celtic tiger , meanwhile , insists it does n't need to be rescued . europe edged closer to its second bailout of a eurozone state on wednesday , as the bloc 's finance ministers announced a joint mission with the imf to ireland directed at stepping up talks on its devastated banking sector .
" the situation is very pressing and very , very serious and we do n't have any time to waste , " eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters after meetings in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they are talks , not bailout negotiations : lenihan " it is essential that confidence in the irish banking sector is restored for the sake of financial stability in europe and for the sake of restoring confidence in the economy . "
irish finance minister brian lenihan confirmed that the emergency talks would begin in dublin on thursday but issued no details on what shape the bailout could take or its possible size .
" we have agreed to look at the structural problems in the irish banks in the light of recent market pressures and assess what needs to be done because banking questions are technical and difficult , " lenihan told irish state radio on wednesday .
dublin reluctant to become ' europe 's lackey ' according to an article published in the wall street journal on wednesday , the irish banking sector is up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering for themselves .
investors fear the final figure could be even higher given rising mortgage arrears , deposit outflows and higher funding costs .
nevertheless , irish leaders continue to refuse that neither the country nor its banks are in need of a bailout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish do n't want to beg like the orphan , oliver twist " what we want to concentrate on now is in a focused way , over coming days , to sit down and see in what way can assistance be provided to ensure that these issues can be dealt with properly and appropriately , " prime minister brian cowen told parliament on wednesday after news of thursday 's emergency talks had emerged .
" there has been no question of the government -lsb- being -rsb- in a negotiation for a bailout , " he said , dismissing the term as pejorative and referring to the fact that the state of ireland is pre-funded until the middle of next year .
meanwhile , the irish people share their prime minister 's resistance to financial assistance from brussels or anywhere else ; in the streets of the irish capital , a european bailout would be a downright " humiliation . "
sean , a 54-year-old , called it " the final insult to the good and decent people of this country , to go like a beggar in brussels and ask that very seasonal question - please sir , can i have some more ? " referring to the charles dickens character oliver twist .
another dubliner , adam , 42 , said it would be " the end of the independent irish republic . "
" i would rather be poor and free than a poor lackey of europe .
it 's time to stand up and be irish once again , " he added .
more eu members to require assistance ?
also on wednesday , eu finance ministers pledged to agree on stricter debt rules by mid-2011 , as well as on a new rescue fund for dangerously indebted countries such as greece - which received substantial eu funds earlier this year to avoid bankruptcy - and a number of other eurozone members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von rompuy : resolution of the crisis is critical for the eu portugal and spain , which are already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , have both alluded to budgetary difficulties .
as with ireland , however , there have been no requests for emergency funding as of yet .
but the ministers gave a clear signal that " determined and coordinated " action had to be taken to resolve the debt crisis that is threatening the future financial stability of europe and the 16-member , single-currency eurozone .
" if we do n't survive with the eurozone we will not survive with the european union , " european council president herman von rompuy said .

" the earliest best evidence for hominin butchery thus remains at 2.6 to 2.5 -lsb- million years -rsb- , " they wrote in their report . dikika researchers respond the dikika research project authors have rejected the new report , saying that the dominguez-rodrigo-led study did not explain away the marks , and have questioned that team ’ s methodology . " manuel dominguez-rodrigo did not look microscopically at the bones , " mcpherron told deutsche welle . " instead , he looked at our photos , many of which are taken microscopically .
there is a very large difference between the two .
thus , for instance , they are obliged to re-assess our description of the v-shape of some marks from our photos whereas in our original publication we had three independent analysts each look at the actual marks . " however , dominguez-rodrigo rejects their rebuttal , and the exchange has become a scientific tit-for-tat . " mcpherron et al argues that the marks we published from our trampling experiments are only superficially similar to the dikika marks , " he said . " this statement is incorrect and experts in our field will appreciate that properly .
we have published in more detail than mcpherron et al have the macroscopic and microscopic characteristics that make both the fossils and trampling marks virtually impossible to differentiate .

dw 's bernd riegert believes ireland should accept aid - fast . the longer you wait , the more costly it gets .
in view of its rampant national debt and heavily indebted banks , ireland will have to accept help from the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
it is only a matter of days , maybe hours .
the eu finance ministers ' plans are ready , but ireland has so far steadfastly resisted applying for a state bailout .
this is a case of misplaced pride on the part of the country 's stricken prime minister , brian cowen .
the former celtic tiger is about to be skinned . cowen did not want to take responsibility for such action in front of his shaken voters .
he also fears the strict conditions that loans entail .
ireland would probably have to raise its extremely low corporate taxes and aggravate the economic crisis further still . every day of hesitation forces the cost of loans on the financial markets to skyrocket , while share prices drop . ireland 's finance minister has finally admitted that the problems seem to have become too big for the small country .
the crisis does not only affect ireland , it affects all of europe .
after all , the european central bank has tirelessly been pumping money into the irish budget , where it buys government bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoid a chain reaction ireland is as good as bankrupt and the eu 's larger member states , including britain that does not have the euro as its currency , will have to help the nation in order to protect their own interests .
ireland is indebted for the most part to britain , germany , the us and france .
an irish insolvency would hit the banks in europe : for instance germany 's state-run hre bank .
it is clearly in europe 's own interest to save ireland - the sooner , the better .
a chain reaction might still be averted , although portugal and possibly spain also stand on the edge of a precipice .
that is what european council president herman van rompuy must have had in mind when he said that the 16 states of the eurozone and the entire eu are fighting for survival .
it is alarming that the financial markets are reacting with a drop in the price of government bonds to chancellor angela merkel 's remarks that private investors should share the costs of state insolvencies after 2013 . debtors want to make money , but they do n't want to carry the risks , and that has to stop .
however , financial markets and investors currently still have the upper hand .
they act and politics is forced to react by using taxpayers ' money to buy time for bankrupt states .
in essence , that is what the bailout is : a safety net .
whether this structure will manage to stabilize the european currency and the financial system remains to be seen .
we are in the midst of a huge experiment .
in the case of greece , 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- were pledged and about 40 billion have been paid .
the next installment ca n't be made because the country has n't completely fulfilled its obligations .
the next crisis is already on the horizon .
the safety net is beginning to tear .

the former celtic tiger , meanwhile , insists it does n't need to be rescued . europe edged closer to its second bailout of a eurozone state on wednesday , as the bloc 's finance ministers announced a joint mission with the imf to ireland directed at stepping up talks on its devastated banking sector .
" the situation is very pressing and very , very serious and we do n't have any time to waste , " eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters after meetings in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they are talks , not bailout negotiations : lenihan " it is essential that confidence in the irish banking sector is restored for the sake of financial stability in europe and for the sake of restoring confidence in the economy . "
irish finance minister brian lenihan confirmed that the emergency talks would begin in dublin on thursday but issued no details on what shape the bailout could take or its possible size .
" we have agreed to look at the structural problems in the irish banks in the light of recent market pressures and assess what needs to be done because banking questions are technical and difficult , " lenihan told irish state radio on wednesday .
dublin reluctant to become ' europe 's lackey ' according to an article published in the wall street journal on wednesday , the irish banking sector is up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering for themselves .
investors fear the final figure could be even higher given rising mortgage arrears , deposit outflows and higher funding costs .
nevertheless , irish leaders continue to refuse that neither the country nor its banks are in need of a bailout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish do n't want to beg like the orphan , oliver twist " what we want to concentrate on now is in a focused way , over coming days , to sit down and see in what way can assistance be provided to ensure that these issues can be dealt with properly and appropriately , " prime minister brian cowen told parliament on wednesday after news of thursday 's emergency talks had emerged .
" there has been no question of the government -lsb- being -rsb- in a negotiation for a bailout , " he said , dismissing the term as pejorative and referring to the fact that the state of ireland is pre-funded until the middle of next year .
meanwhile , the irish people share their prime minister 's resistance to financial assistance from brussels or anywhere else ; in the streets of the irish capital , a european bailout would be a downright " humiliation . "
sean , a 54-year-old , called it " the final insult to the good and decent people of this country , to go like a beggar in brussels and ask that very seasonal question - please sir , can i have some more ? " referring to the charles dickens character oliver twist .
another dubliner , adam , 42 , said it would be " the end of the independent irish republic . "
" i would rather be poor and free than a poor lackey of europe .
it 's time to stand up and be irish once again , " he added .
more eu members to require assistance ?
also on wednesday , eu finance ministers pledged to agree on stricter debt rules by mid-2011 , as well as on a new rescue fund for dangerously indebted countries such as greece - which received substantial eu funds earlier this year to avoid bankruptcy - and a number of other eurozone members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von rompuy : resolution of the crisis is critical for the eu portugal and spain , which are already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , have both alluded to budgetary difficulties .
as with ireland , however , there have been no requests for emergency funding as of yet .
but the ministers gave a clear signal that " determined and coordinated " action had to be taken to resolve the debt crisis that is threatening the future financial stability of europe and the 16-member , single-currency eurozone .
" if we do n't survive with the eurozone we will not survive with the european union , " european council president herman von rompuy said .

deutsche welle spoke to the eu 's special envoy for myanmar , piero fassino . deutsche welle : myanmar 's military government released opposition leader aung san suu kyi after more than 15 years of detention .
how does the european union consider this move ? piero fassino : the most important thing , for her family and her people , is that aung san suu kyi is finally free .
what is also important is that she is enabled to come back to politics now , as myanmar is in a crucial and delicate phase .
elections have been held and a new parliament elected .
the new parliament will start working next february .
this will lead to a new civilian government , which should take over power from the military junta .
therefore , it could be the beginning of a period of political and institutional change and it is essential that suu kyi can participate as a major player in this new political phase . the recent elections were one step towards what the military rulers call " disciplined democracy . "
does the european union consider these elections to be truly democratic ? elections were held in a context that was strongly controlled and conditioned by the regime , according to dubious electoral laws and regulations , certainly not in line with european and international accepted standards . however , it needs also to be noted that during the electoral campaign civil society and opposition forces proved significantly lively .
it is also relevant that , notwithstanding all the existing obstacles , opposition parties registered for the elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icon suu kyi has promised to look into poll irregularities it will be very important to see the results .
depending on how many elected representatives from the opposition forces and ethnic groups win seats in the local and national parliaments , we will be able to give a more complete evaluation of these elections . burma is a very multiethnic society .
what position does the eu have about the ethnic minorities ' struggle for more autonomy ? the european union condemns any form of hostility and oppression against ethnic minorities .
in the framework of the current political transition , ethnic communities need to be fully associated to , and become part of , the political process . one of the essential issues to be dealt with in the context of the transition is precisely how to ensure the respect of the rights of the minorities , their autonomy and the possibility to participate in the life of the country without restraints . have the elections and the release of aung san suu kyi opened up a chance for a transformation process ? the release of aung san suu kyi is a first step .
now more steps into the right direction are needed : the release of all political detainees and the opening of a true , meaningful dialogue between the junta , the democratic opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities . in her first public speech after her release , aung san suu kyi explicitly urged the authorities to start a dialogue and expressed her availability to take up responsibilities in the management of the transition .
such a dialogue has to be free , honest and needs to aim at a definitive democratic transition allowing myanmar to reach those standards of freedom and democracy which are the mark of all free nations .
how will the eu press the government of myanmar towards a more pluralistic system ? we should not take anything for granted .
we certainly hope that the release of aung san suu kyi can open a door , and it is for this reason that we are asking , after her release , for more meaningful acts , clearly showing the will of the authorities for a democratic transition . bildunterschrift : fassino calls for more aid for cyclone-devastated areas the international community must keep myanmar as a priority on its political agenda and must accompany and assist the democratic transition .
therefore , we need a policy aimed at increasing our relations with myanmar . we must increase humanitarian assistance particularly in those areas devastated by the nargis typhoon , where reconstruction and rehabilitation is needed .
we must increase development aid in vital sectors for the burmese people , such as water , education , health and assistance to children .

among other things , vasconcelos addressed the outlook for european engagement in afghanistan .
deutsche welle : the war in afghanistan is now in its ninth year and the original goal of establishing a democracy there is all but gone .
europeans have been deeply skeptical of the afghan mission for a long time .
could europe do more in afghanistan ?
alvaro de vasconcelos : we can do more .
but to do more we should do it in a civilian way .
we are going to have the nato summit in a few days and the temptation will be to say the civilian training in afghanistan must be done by nato itself because the europeans are not doing as much as necessary and the americans will essentially work through nato .
i think this is as mistake .
because this will make civilians become part of a military operation .
we need to delink the civilian from the military .
of course the military is needed to guarantee the protection of the civilian training .
but we need to train the police in a different way then we train the military .
the police are trained to protect people , so we need to move toward this core aspect - human security and strategy where the main objective is to protect the civilians in afghanistan and not to kill the enemy .
because as president obama from day one said we should not be in afghanistan to kill civilians , but to protect them .
do you think europeans would support sending more police trainers to afghanistan ?
i think if there is a clear shift in the strategy in afghanistan in that we say we are not there to win a war , we are there to build an afghan state , an afghan army , an afghan police force , this would be welcome , because the people in europe want their soldiers home .
most public opinion polls in europe show that the majority of people want their soldiers back as soon as possible .
so if you devise a strategy that will bring your troops home - which is what president obama has announced - and you show that this is a crisis management and state-building operation that involves the united nations to a larger degree , that will get much more support in europe .
there has been a lot of debate in the past years whether or not the west should talk to the taliban .
what is your opinion ?
my sense is that there is more or less a consensus now in europe , and i think also in the united states , that there is a need for a political process .
you can speak about talking to taliban in two ways : one is to say we are talking with the good taliban .
we would then be dividing the taliban leadership by talking to local leaders and this would be a kind of counterinsurgency strategy .
this was used in iraq .
but the essential problem is that the taliban leadership will still be there and will still have a lot of support in some areas of the country and it will still be able to make war and create enormous difficulties to the international coalition . the other is to start communication at the highest level of the taliban in afghanistan .
but if you -lrb- do that , -rrb- the biggest difficulty is to decide what we want from them .
are we prepared to have the taliban in power again in kabul ?
what would be the impact of that in international public opinion - but especially in europe and the united states ?
the role of president karzai is a very contentious issue , which came up again recently after he confirmed reports that he was regularly accepting large sums of cash from iran .
is karzai for europe and the us still the best option to lead afghanistan ?
so far he is the only option .
no one has found a better option for afghanistan up to now .
we know that the elections were not very transparent and that it is important now to establish legitimacy and credibility .
but karzai is in power now , the election results were accepted after lots of doubts , and the europeans and the americans as well as the international community are now working with him .
and he is a very skillfull politician with many connections in afghanistan and he knows the country well , so he can start the process of talking with the taliban .
so he certainly is and will be playing an important political role .

in view of its rampant national debt and heavily indebted banks , ireland will have to accept help from the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
it is only a matter of days , maybe hours .
the eu finance ministers ' plans are ready , but ireland has so far steadfastly resisted applying for a state bailout .
this is a case of misplaced pride on the part of the country 's stricken prime minister , brian cowen .
the former celtic tiger is about to be skinned . cowen did not want to take responsibility for such action in front of his shaken voters .
he also fears the strict conditions that loans entail .
ireland would probably have to raise its extremely low corporate taxes and aggravate the economic crisis further still . every day of hesitation forces the cost of loans on the financial markets to skyrocket , while share prices drop . ireland 's finance minister has finally admitted that the problems seem to have become too big for the small country .
the crisis does not only affect ireland , it affects all of europe .
after all , the european central bank has tirelessly been pumping money into the irish budget , where it buys government bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoid a chain reaction ireland is as good as bankrupt and the eu 's larger member states , including britain that does not have the euro as its currency , will have to help the nation in order to protect their own interests .
ireland is indebted for the most part to britain , germany , the us and france .
an irish insolvency would hit the banks in europe : for instance germany 's state-run hre bank .
it is clearly in europe 's own interest to save ireland - the sooner , the better .
a chain reaction might still be averted , although portugal and possibly spain also stand on the edge of a precipice .
that is what european council president herman van rompuy must have had in mind when he said that the 16 states of the eurozone and the entire eu are fighting for survival .
it is alarming that the financial markets are reacting with a drop in the price of government bonds to chancellor angela merkel 's remarks that private investors should share the costs of state insolvencies after 2013 . debtors want to make money , but they do n't want to carry the risks , and that has to stop .
however , financial markets and investors currently still have the upper hand .
they act and politics is forced to react by using taxpayers ' money to buy time for bankrupt states .
in essence , that is what the bailout is : a safety net .
whether this structure will manage to stabilize the european currency and the financial system remains to be seen .
we are in the midst of a huge experiment .
in the case of greece , 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- were pledged and about 40 billion have been paid .
the next installment ca n't be made because the country has n't completely fulfilled its obligations .
the next crisis is already on the horizon .
the safety net is beginning to tear .

dw-world.de ireland is still sidestepping what experts say is inevitable : a bailout will ireland accept a bailout and help reverse a bond sell-off among the eurozone 's deficit-laden nations ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 17.11.2010 how to slaughter a digital sheep großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the e-sheep help pilgrims to give sacrificial meat to the needy does the feast of sacrifice mean that streets and squares in mecca are filled with slaughtered animals ?
no !
as dw reporter ali almakhlafi discovered , digital sheep are getting more and more popular . blood and dead sheep everywhere ?
spellbound pilgrims slaughtering live animals by the dozen ? that 's how a friend of mine imagined the feast of sacrifice .
and maybe some of dw 's readers thought so as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multicultural mecca : pilgrims from chad , china , lebanon , brazil , and austria i ca n't say that animal rights activists and vegetarians would enjoy what 's happening here – but the feast of sacrifice in mina is n't massacre-like , as my friend expected .
in accordance with islamic tradition , the sacrificial animals are slaughtered by a method called thaliba : their throats are cut and they bleed dry .
usually , this is done by a butcher or under professional instruction in one of the big butcheries .
the animals are definitively not being slaughtered on market squares , or even in front of a mosque .
the ritual took place on tuesday , november 16 , when muslims celebrated the feast of sacrifice .
however , animals are also sacrificed on the following two days of the hajj .
so far , however , i have n't seen any blood .
and that 's due to a new trend , which is quite popular in mecca , but also among turkish and arabic muslims living in germany : instead of sacrificing a real sheep , they sacrifice digital sheep - also called an electronic sheep or an e-sheep . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this sign indicates : ' no stone throwing ' i know it sounds funny , but it 's actually quite reasonable if you think about it .
on the one hand , muslims are supposed to sacrifice an animal during the hajj and then give the meat to the poor and needy .
on the other hand , there are n't all that many needy people in saudi arabia , at least not compared with other parts of the world , such as africa .
the idea is , you pay 400 rial -lrb- 80 euros -rrb- to a charitable foundation online , thereby purchasing a digital sheep .
the foundation will then make sure that a real sheep is slaughtered , and the meat is given to needy people in the respective country .
" i think that 's a great idea , " a saudi pilgrim tells me .
" what should we do with all the meat in our fridges ?
there are people who need it much more than we do . "
throwing stones at satan i 'm here as a journalist , so i did n't slaughter a sheep , not even a digital one .
but i wanted to at least stone the devil .
again , that all happened symbolically . on the hajj , pilgrims stone the devil numerous times .
it 's an important ritual , not only on the feast of sacrifice .
when throwing a stone , pilgrims speak out loud : " in the name of god , god is great . "
by doing so , they 're asking for god 's forgiveness for their sins .
the pilgrims have collected the stones they throw in the valley of muzdalifah .
2 million pilgrims arriving in mecca with 49 pebble stones each – that adds up to some 300 tons of stone .
after the hajj , saudi authorities make sure that the stones are transported back to muzdalifah .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i succeeded at ' stoning the devil ' a wall at one of the three pillars of jamarat bridge symbolizes the devil .
in fact , the huge bridge is a blessing for the hajj .
a couple of years ago , it was reconstructed as a five-story building with the help of german engineers .
now it 's a lot bigger , and also safer than before .
since it was rebuilt there have been no mass panics causing causalties , like there used to be .
a hair for every sin when the feast of sacrifice is over , pilgrims leave the state of consecration .
that was when i meet aaron from indonesia , who was holding scissors in his hand .
along with many other men here , he was about to have his head shaven .
shaving , or at least cutting ones hair , is an important part of the hajj .
i asked aaron why he wants to have his head shaven instead of just cutting off a little of his hair .
he said : " every hair on my head represents a sin to me .
and having my head shaved completely , it 's like being a newborn child – free of sins . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aaron from indonesia by the way , i discovered a funny aspect to the ritual .
there are , of course , men who have a bald head in the first place .
they either prefer a bald head or they lost their hair for some reason .
however , many of those men have their heads shaven symbolically , even though there 's really nothing to shave .
after the ritual , pilgrims take off their hajj garment and put on their everyday clothes .
and so i put on my jeans and polo shirt once again .
hajj attire " made in china " you might not have thought about the fact that many of the hajj clothes in mecca bear the label " made in china , " but they do .
muhammad , a pilgrim from china , told me that – and he 's very proud of it .
he 's part of the muslim minority in his country , which is even suppressed to some extent .
but muhammad still feels like a real chinese .
he told me he wished china would become the " world champion of global economy , " well , i guess china is heading in the right direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammad is proud that many hajj clothes are made in china again and again , i 'm excited by the international atmosphere over here .
i 'd like to answer a question posted by dw user detlev abebe , who wants to know : " what 's you 're impression of the majority of pilgrims ?
are they open-minded and tolerant – or do they just stick to a fixed ideology ? "
i would say it 's the former .
i definitely have n't seen anybody holding a fundamentalist speech in public .
most of the people here are just happy to experience a highly significant religious event together with pilgrims from around the world .
of course , the official saudi interpretation of islam is something different .
it 's very conservative , indeed .
yet , i 'm also surprised by how the conservative regulations are handled over here .
for example , there are rather strict rules for how men and women should interact with each other .
but they are n't taken that seriously by many pilgrims - especially when they 're not in public places .
and here 's another rather peculiar example : it 's illegal to sell cigarettes in mecca , but it 's allowed to smoke .
unveiled women i have n't found a definite answer to a question posted by dw user " milena " : " why is it that women are n't allowed to wear veils during the pilgrimage ? "
apparently , the rule says that women 's faces need to be recognizable during the hajj .
a religious scholar here told me that it probably goes back to how the prophets ' wives used to dress .
they were n't wearing veils .
and i personally think it could be a good sign that veils are n't a matter of religion , but a matter of tradition .

but the chief of the german central bank says banks should prepare for changes now . if there 's one thing the bankers and regulators gathered at the euro finance week in frankfurt agree on , it is that reform on a national level alone wo n't do much to stabilize the financial industry .
instead , they say that loopholes need to be plugged on an international level .
the german-centric economic forum started on monday , and there has been little doubt among attendees that action should be taken even before the stricter capital requirements of basel iii take effect in 2013 .
financial systems should be made more stable and resilient , they say .
german central bank president axel weber singled out german public-sector banks in his remarks .
" i believe , particularly in this sector , that the mikado-strategy that 's been pursued so far is leading nowhere , " weber said .
two such banks – bayernlb and westlb – recently failed in a merger attempt after receiving billions of taxpayer euros during the crisis .
the european commission set a new deadline of february 2011 for westlb to come up with ideas of how to sustain itself in the long term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels has given westlb a three-month deadline for restructuring weber said banks should n't be sluggish about making changes , and that they need to be proactive in preparing for coming regulations .
" changes will be coming to the market structure , " he said .
" there will be further changes .
the profiles of the actors will change , and the type and scope of the banking business will be affected .
" the refinancing structure of the banking system will change .
eventually there will also be less actors .
several will drop out – those which can not meet these new capital requirements . "
bankers have often complained about having to carry the high costs of the new regulations , but weber said that " a more stable financial system is worth the price . "
risks to international competition deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann spoke out against the notion of additional capital requirements for banks in germany , saying international competition is a concern .
what is needed is a method in which " banks which are a burden for the system – and therefore also taxpayers – can be eliminated , " he said .
" when you go to singapore , hong kong or shanghai today , then you experience what 's meant by location competition , " he said .
" and i believe we should always consider here what options we have to make the entire system more robust above all , but without giving up location advantages or tolerating location disadvantages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's ackermann defended big banking ackermann also defended large banking from skeptics who say banks were granted bailouts specifically because they had become too large to be allowed to fail .
" it is absolutely necessary that we define ourselves beyond national boundaries , " he said .
on monday a panel of economic journalists named ackermann ' european banker of the year ' for successfully leading his institution through the financial crisis .
asian banks ' ready ' according to wolfgang kirsch , ceo of dz bank , germany 's central cooperative bank , asian competitors are now primed and ready .
" after the asian crisis – this rough treatment which , in part , we 've been experiencing these days – this was something asian banks went through , " he said .
" and today they can happily call out , ' basel iii is n't an issue for us . '
anyone who says basel iii is n't an issue clearly has his own capital and liquidity .
and both of those things want to be utilized .
so we should keep an eye on that . "
the german central bank 's weber , however , foresees the need for regulation beyond just the banking system .
he said financial groups funneled billions of euros past regulators , agitating the financial crisis .
" we need to cast light into the shadows of the banking system , " he said .

the former celtic tiger , meanwhile , insists it does n't need to be rescued . europe edged closer to its second bailout of a eurozone state on wednesday , as the bloc 's finance ministers announced a joint mission with the imf to ireland directed at stepping up talks on its devastated banking sector .
" the situation is very pressing and very , very serious and we do n't have any time to waste , " eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters after meetings in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they are talks , not bailout negotiations : lenihan " it is essential that confidence in the irish banking sector is restored for the sake of financial stability in europe and for the sake of restoring confidence in the economy . "
irish finance minister brian lenihan confirmed that the emergency talks would begin in dublin on thursday but issued no details on what shape the bailout could take or its possible size .
" we have agreed to look at the structural problems in the irish banks in the light of recent market pressures and assess what needs to be done because banking questions are technical and difficult , " lenihan told irish state radio on wednesday .
dublin reluctant to become ' europe 's lackey ' according to an article published in the wall street journal on wednesday , the irish banking sector is up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering for themselves .
investors fear the final figure could be even higher given rising mortgage arrears , deposit outflows and higher funding costs .
nevertheless , irish leaders continue to refuse that neither the country nor its banks are in need of a bailout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish do n't want to beg like the orphan , oliver twist " what we want to concentrate on now is in a focused way , over coming days , to sit down and see in what way can assistance be provided to ensure that these issues can be dealt with properly and appropriately , " prime minister brian cowen told parliament on wednesday after news of thursday 's emergency talks had emerged .
" there has been no question of the government -lsb- being -rsb- in a negotiation for a bailout , " he said , dismissing the term as pejorative and referring to the fact that the state of ireland is pre-funded until the middle of next year .
meanwhile , the irish people share their prime minister 's resistance to financial assistance from brussels or anywhere else ; in the streets of the irish capital , a european bailout would be a downright " humiliation . "
sean , a 54-year-old , called it " the final insult to the good and decent people of this country , to go like a beggar in brussels and ask that very seasonal question - please sir , can i have some more ? " referring to the charles dickens character oliver twist .
another dubliner , adam , 42 , said it would be " the end of the independent irish republic . "
" i would rather be poor and free than a poor lackey of europe .
it 's time to stand up and be irish once again , " he added .
more eu members to require assistance ?
also on wednesday , eu finance ministers pledged to agree on stricter debt rules by mid-2011 , as well as on a new rescue fund for dangerously indebted countries such as greece - which received substantial eu funds earlier this year to avoid bankruptcy - and a number of other eurozone members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von rompuy : resolution of the crisis is critical for the eu portugal and spain , which are already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , have both alluded to budgetary difficulties .
as with ireland , however , there have been no requests for emergency funding as of yet .
but the ministers gave a clear signal that " determined and coordinated " action had to be taken to resolve the debt crisis that is threatening the future financial stability of europe and the 16-member , single-currency eurozone .
" if we do n't survive with the eurozone we will not survive with the european union , " european council president herman von rompuy said .

deutsche welle spoke to the eu 's special envoy for myanmar , piero fassino . deutsche welle : myanmar 's military government released opposition leader aung san suu kyi after more than 15 years of detention .
how does the european union consider this move ? piero fassino : the most important thing , for her family and her people , is that aung san suu kyi is finally free .
what is also important is that she is enabled to come back to politics now , as myanmar is in a crucial and delicate phase .
elections have been held and a new parliament elected .
the new parliament will start working next february .
this will lead to a new civilian government , which should take over power from the military junta .
therefore , it could be the beginning of a period of political and institutional change and it is essential that suu kyi can participate as a major player in this new political phase . the recent elections were one step towards what the military rulers call " disciplined democracy . "
does the european union consider these elections to be truly democratic ? elections were held in a context that was strongly controlled and conditioned by the regime , according to dubious electoral laws and regulations , certainly not in line with european and international accepted standards . however , it needs also to be noted that during the electoral campaign civil society and opposition forces proved significantly lively .
it is also relevant that , notwithstanding all the existing obstacles , opposition parties registered for the elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icon suu kyi has promised to look into poll irregularities it will be very important to see the results .

sparks could fly in the wake of a recent investigation implicating the regulators in mismanagement . representatives of the 48-member international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- have begun a 10-day meeting in the french capital to seek a compromise between boosting stocks of the dwindling atlantic bluefin tuna species and salvaging a multi-billion dollar industry spread across the mediterranean .
gemma parkes , a spokesperson for wwf mediterranean , said iccat is under increased pressure to impose further restrictions after a ban on bluefin tuna fishing failed to pass earlier this year .
" it 's showdown time for iccat - time to prove what they can do , " parkes told deutsche welle from the meeting in paris .
the wwf is an official observer of the iccat meeting and is allowed to sit through some of the meetings and sometimes intervene .
it 's unclear as yet just how radical iccat 's decisions will be on bluefin catch-quotas for next year .
iccat 's scientific committee said last month that extending the 2010 catch limit for each of the next three years would give bluefin in the eastern atlantic and mediterranean a 63-percent chance of attaining so-called " maximum sustainable yield " by 2022 .
the fishing industry supports this continuation of the current recovery program , but says additional cuts could devastate the fishing industry .
competing interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists have taken direct action to stop purse seining in the mediterranean .
" the fishing sector is already in a delicate situation .
a reduction in quotas could destroy companies and have ramifications far beyond just the vessel .
there are many industries relying on a vessel , like the harbor , traders and transport , " javier garat , president of europeche , a european organization which defends the interests of fishing enterprises , told deutsche welle .
environmental groups are pressing for much lower limits .
" a 60 % chance of recovery is n't good enough .
it 's not acceptable to allow for a 40 % chance of collapse .
who would get on a plane that only has a 40 % chance of arriving at its destination ? "
parkes said .
the wwf is pushing for quotas to be cut from 13,500 to between zero and 6,000 tons .
that they say would at least give stocks an 85 % chance of recovery by 2022 .
" we are also urging for an end to purse-seining and the establishment of ' no fishing zones ' in spawning areas , " gemma parkes added .
purse-seine fishing in the mediterranean traps bluefin – and other by-catch - in floating drawstring nets that loop around an enormous areas .
it can capture thousands of fish at once , which are then hauled to coastal " farms " where they are fattened for market .
wwf , along with ngos oceana , greenpeace , and the pew environment group , have called for a ban on this kind of fishing .
garat from europeche defends the practice and said " there 's no problem with purse-seine fishing as long as it complies with quotas . "
a ban on purse-seine fishing " is a realistic scenario , " said fabio hazin , chairman of the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- at a discussion forum .
rule breaking the meeting comes at a sensitive time for iccat , which came under fire in an investigative report earlier this month for failing to monitor the bluefin fishing industry effectively .
the report by the international consortium of investigative journalists -lrb- icij -rrb- painted a bleak picture of over-exploitation in the tuna trade .
" there has been a depressingly widespread lack of control and respect for rules , " parkes said .
she says that iccat " needs to be able to enforce the rules " .
the fishing industry fiercely denies breaking the rules .
" fishermen have made a huge sacrifice to comply with the recovery plan .
evidence shows that compliance with the recovery plan is very strict , " javier garat said .
iccat is expected to discuss the findings of the report pertaining to infringements of its rules during the meeting in paris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's appetite for sushi has fuelled the bluefish tuna industry threatened species driven by wholesale prices in japan that can top 100,000 dollars per specimen , industrial-scale fishing in the mediterranean and eastern atlantic has depleted stocks by almost three quarters over the past four decades , while the size of the average captured bluefin tuna has almost halved .
the japanese consume 80 percent of the atlantic bluefin catch , with americans appetites accounting for nine percent .
iccat member-states disagreed sharply going into the meeting as to whether next year 's quotas should remain at 13,500 tons , or be cut in half , or even suspended .
france 's fisheries minister , bruno le maire , said his country favored maintaining the 13,500 quota , a position backed by spain and italy .
britain and germany , along with eu fisheries commissioner maria damanaki , have come out in favor of a sharp reduction .
the european union was supposed to forge a common position going into the meeting , but has so far failed to do so .
" it 's going to be a tough two weeks .
tuna trading has a strong lobby that wants to keep the status quo .
we 're hopeful of a positive outcome and there 's a lot of international support on our side , " parkes said .
europeche president garat said the industry was facing increasingly stiff opposition .
" we have noticed that the pressure from ngos and is very big . "

among other things , vasconcelos addressed the outlook for european engagement in afghanistan .
deutsche welle : the war in afghanistan is now in its ninth year and the original goal of establishing a democracy there is all but gone .
europeans have been deeply skeptical of the afghan mission for a long time .
could europe do more in afghanistan ?
alvaro de vasconcelos : we can do more .
but to do more we should do it in a civilian way .
we are going to have the nato summit in a few days and the temptation will be to say the civilian training in afghanistan must be done by nato itself because the europeans are not doing as much as necessary and the americans will essentially work through nato .
i think this is as mistake .
because this will make civilians become part of a military operation .
we need to delink the civilian from the military .
of course the military is needed to guarantee the protection of the civilian training .
but we need to train the police in a different way then we train the military .
the police are trained to protect people , so we need to move toward this core aspect - human security and strategy where the main objective is to protect the civilians in afghanistan and not to kill the enemy .
because as president obama from day one said we should not be in afghanistan to kill civilians , but to protect them .
do you think europeans would support sending more police trainers to afghanistan ?
i think if there is a clear shift in the strategy in afghanistan in that we say we are not there to win a war , we are there to build an afghan state , an afghan army , an afghan police force , this would be welcome , because the people in europe want their soldiers home .
most public opinion polls in europe show that the majority of people want their soldiers back as soon as possible .
so if you devise a strategy that will bring your troops home - which is what president obama has announced - and you show that this is a crisis management and state-building operation that involves the united nations to a larger degree , that will get much more support in europe .
there has been a lot of debate in the past years whether or not the west should talk to the taliban .
what is your opinion ?
my sense is that there is more or less a consensus now in europe , and i think also in the united states , that there is a need for a political process .
you can speak about talking to taliban in two ways : one is to say we are talking with the good taliban .
we would then be dividing the taliban leadership by talking to local leaders and this would be a kind of counterinsurgency strategy .
this was used in iraq .
but the essential problem is that the taliban leadership will still be there and will still have a lot of support in some areas of the country and it will still be able to make war and create enormous difficulties to the international coalition . the other is to start communication at the highest level of the taliban in afghanistan .
but if you -lrb- do that , -rrb- the biggest difficulty is to decide what we want from them .
are we prepared to have the taliban in power again in kabul ?
what would be the impact of that in international public opinion - but especially in europe and the united states ?
the role of president karzai is a very contentious issue , which came up again recently after he confirmed reports that he was regularly accepting large sums of cash from iran .
is karzai for europe and the us still the best option to lead afghanistan ?
so far he is the only option .
no one has found a better option for afghanistan up to now .
we know that the elections were not very transparent and that it is important now to establish legitimacy and credibility .
but karzai is in power now , the election results were accepted after lots of doubts , and the europeans and the americans as well as the international community are now working with him .
and he is a very skillfull politician with many connections in afghanistan and he knows the country well , so he can start the process of talking with the taliban .
so he certainly is and will be playing an important political role .

deutsche welle spoke to the eu 's special envoy for myanmar , piero fassino . deutsche welle : myanmar 's military government released opposition leader aung san suu kyi after more than 15 years of detention .
how does the european union consider this move ? piero fassino : the most important thing , for her family and her people , is that aung san suu kyi is finally free .
what is also important is that she is enabled to come back to politics now , as myanmar is in a crucial and delicate phase .
elections have been held and a new parliament elected .
the new parliament will start working next february .
this will lead to a new civilian government , which should take over power from the military junta .
therefore , it could be the beginning of a period of political and institutional change and it is essential that suu kyi can participate as a major player in this new political phase . the recent elections were one step towards what the military rulers call " disciplined democracy . "
does the european union consider these elections to be truly democratic ? elections were held in a context that was strongly controlled and conditioned by the regime , according to dubious electoral laws and regulations , certainly not in line with european and international accepted standards . however , it needs also to be noted that during the electoral campaign civil society and opposition forces proved significantly lively .
it is also relevant that , notwithstanding all the existing obstacles , opposition parties registered for the elections .

but the chief of the german central bank says banks should prepare for changes now . if there 's one thing the bankers and regulators gathered at the euro finance week in frankfurt agree on , it is that reform on a national level alone wo n't do much to stabilize the financial industry .
instead , they say that loopholes need to be plugged on an international level .
the german-centric economic forum started on monday , and there has been little doubt among attendees that action should be taken even before the stricter capital requirements of basel iii take effect in 2013 .
financial systems should be made more stable and resilient , they say .
german central bank president axel weber singled out german public-sector banks in his remarks .
" i believe , particularly in this sector , that the mikado-strategy that 's been pursued so far is leading nowhere , " weber said .
two such banks – bayernlb and westlb – recently failed in a merger attempt after receiving billions of taxpayer euros during the crisis .
the european commission set a new deadline of february 2011 for westlb to come up with ideas of how to sustain itself in the long term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels has given westlb a three-month deadline for restructuring weber said banks should n't be sluggish about making changes , and that they need to be proactive in preparing for coming regulations .
" changes will be coming to the market structure , " he said .
" there will be further changes .
the profiles of the actors will change , and the type and scope of the banking business will be affected .
" the refinancing structure of the banking system will change .
eventually there will also be less actors .
several will drop out – those which can not meet these new capital requirements . "
bankers have often complained about having to carry the high costs of the new regulations , but weber said that " a more stable financial system is worth the price . "
risks to international competition deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann spoke out against the notion of additional capital requirements for banks in germany , saying international competition is a concern .
what is needed is a method in which " banks which are a burden for the system – and therefore also taxpayers – can be eliminated , " he said .
" when you go to singapore , hong kong or shanghai today , then you experience what 's meant by location competition , " he said .
" and i believe we should always consider here what options we have to make the entire system more robust above all , but without giving up location advantages or tolerating location disadvantages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's ackermann defended big banking ackermann also defended large banking from skeptics who say banks were granted bailouts specifically because they had become too large to be allowed to fail .
" it is absolutely necessary that we define ourselves beyond national boundaries , " he said .

but the chief of the german central bank says banks should prepare for changes now . if there 's one thing the bankers and regulators gathered at the euro finance week in frankfurt agree on , it is that reform on a national level alone wo n't do much to stabilize the financial industry .
instead , they say that loopholes need to be plugged on an international level .
the german-centric economic forum started on monday , and there has been little doubt among attendees that action should be taken even before the stricter capital requirements of basel iii take effect in 2013 .
financial systems should be made more stable and resilient , they say .
german central bank president axel weber singled out german public-sector banks in his remarks .
" i believe , particularly in this sector , that the mikado-strategy that 's been pursued so far is leading nowhere , " weber said .
two such banks – bayernlb and westlb – recently failed in a merger attempt after receiving billions of taxpayer euros during the crisis .
the european commission set a new deadline of february 2011 for westlb to come up with ideas of how to sustain itself in the long term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels has given westlb a three-month deadline for restructuring weber said banks should n't be sluggish about making changes , and that they need to be proactive in preparing for coming regulations .
" changes will be coming to the market structure , " he said .
" there will be further changes .
the profiles of the actors will change , and the type and scope of the banking business will be affected .
" the refinancing structure of the banking system will change .
eventually there will also be less actors .
several will drop out – those which can not meet these new capital requirements . "
bankers have often complained about having to carry the high costs of the new regulations , but weber said that " a more stable financial system is worth the price . "
risks to international competition deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann spoke out against the notion of additional capital requirements for banks in germany , saying international competition is a concern .
what is needed is a method in which " banks which are a burden for the system – and therefore also taxpayers – can be eliminated , " he said .
" when you go to singapore , hong kong or shanghai today , then you experience what 's meant by location competition , " he said .
" and i believe we should always consider here what options we have to make the entire system more robust above all , but without giving up location advantages or tolerating location disadvantages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's ackermann defended big banking ackermann also defended large banking from skeptics who say banks were granted bailouts specifically because they had become too large to be allowed to fail .
" it is absolutely necessary that we define ourselves beyond national boundaries , " he said .
on monday a panel of economic journalists named ackermann ' european banker of the year ' for successfully leading his institution through the financial crisis .
asian banks ' ready ' according to wolfgang kirsch , ceo of dz bank , germany 's central cooperative bank , asian competitors are now primed and ready .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 17.11.2010 opinion : ireland needs to accept help the sooner , the better großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurozone finance ministers are taking a hard look at ireland , the latest member to come under intense bond market pressure .
dw 's bernd riegert believes ireland should accept aid - fast . the longer you wait , the more costly it gets .
in view of its rampant national debt and heavily indebted banks , ireland will have to accept help from the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
it is only a matter of days , maybe hours .
the eu finance ministers ' plans are ready , but ireland has so far steadfastly resisted applying for a state bailout .
this is a case of misplaced pride on the part of the country 's stricken prime minister , brian cowen .
the former celtic tiger is about to be skinned . cowen did not want to take responsibility for such action in front of his shaken voters .
he also fears the strict conditions that loans entail .
ireland would probably have to raise its extremely low corporate taxes and aggravate the economic crisis further still . every day of hesitation forces the cost of loans on the financial markets to skyrocket , while share prices drop . ireland 's finance minister has finally admitted that the problems seem to have become too big for the small country .
the crisis does not only affect ireland , it affects all of europe .
after all , the european central bank has tirelessly been pumping money into the irish budget , where it buys government bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoid a chain reaction ireland is as good as bankrupt and the eu 's larger member states , including britain that does not have the euro as its currency , will have to help the nation in order to protect their own interests .
ireland is indebted for the most part to britain , germany , the us and france .
an irish insolvency would hit the banks in europe : for instance germany 's state-run hre bank .
it is clearly in europe 's own interest to save ireland - the sooner , the better .
a chain reaction might still be averted , although portugal and possibly spain also stand on the edge of a precipice .
that is what european council president herman van rompuy must have had in mind when he said that the 16 states of the eurozone and the entire eu are fighting for survival .
it is alarming that the financial markets are reacting with a drop in the price of government bonds to chancellor angela merkel 's remarks that private investors should share the costs of state insolvencies after 2013 . debtors want to make money , but they do n't want to carry the risks , and that has to stop .
however , financial markets and investors currently still have the upper hand .
they act and politics is forced to react by using taxpayers ' money to buy time for bankrupt states .
in essence , that is what the bailout is : a safety net .
whether this structure will manage to stabilize the european currency and the financial system remains to be seen .
we are in the midst of a huge experiment .
in the case of greece , 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- were pledged and about 40 billion have been paid .
the next installment ca n't be made because the country has n't completely fulfilled its obligations .
the next crisis is already on the horizon .
the safety net is beginning to tear .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 17.11.2010 european e-commerce struggles to cross borders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans increasingly embrace e-commerce european consumers are showing more interest in buying goods online from other nations , and more retailers want to sell their wares across borders , too .
but plenty of hurdles still hinder e-commerce in europe . e-commerce is taking off domestically in many european countries , including germany .
but few companies in the region have ventured beyond their home markets to sell their products via the internet to consumers in other countries .
a patchwork of rules regulating consumer transactions across europe continues to inhibit many retailers from selling abroad .
and , unfortunately , a quick fix is not in sight .
" more than two thirds of retailers in -lrb- germany -rrb- say they do n't use the internet to sell abroad largely because they are unfamiliar with the legal situation in the various countries , " nikolaus lindner , a legal expert at the german subsidiary of ebay , told deutsche welle .
widening gap germany is hardly alone .
the gap between domestic and international e-commerce across the eu is widening as a result of cross-border barriers to online trade , according to the european commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebay is among the companies calling for harmonized rules and regulations from 2006 to 2008 , the share of all eu consumers who bought at least one item domestically over the internet increased from 27 percent to 33 percent , while cross-border e-commerce rose only marginally from 6 percent to 7 percent .
yet demand for cross-border service exists : one third of all eu citizens indicate they would consider buying a product from another member state via the internet because it 's cheaper or better or not available in their home country .
consumers and retailers hope the european commission 's proposed consumer rights directive will help clear the way for cross-border e-commerce .
the directive tackles , among other things , the prickly issue of legal fragmentation in areas such as product returns , guarantees and intellectual property rights as well as rules for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste .
big roadblock missing in this lineup , however , is value-added tax , which can vary widely from state to state .
many retailers see it as a significant obstacle to selling abroad .
the problem is , such taxes are a member-state issue , still outside the scope of eu legislation .
ebay 's lindner argues retailers would be much more willing to engage in cross-border selling if the risks of failing to comply with various national regulations could be eliminated through rules at the eu-level .
the cost of fragmentation , he says , is a heavy burden on business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission hopes to harmonize laws to boost e-commerce for many , full harmonization is the ultimate goal .
but it 's proving to be a true tug-of-war .
harmonization is among the most debated issues in both european parliament sessions and meetings of representatives of national ministries in the european council .
many parliament members see a form of " targeted harmonization " as the way forward .
" the problem is consumer protection rules have not been developed across europe in any organized fashion but in a completely uncoordinated way , " said andreas schwab , a member of the european parliament .
" you ca n't put into a policy paper that you will always take the highest level consumer protection from all states because that creates a problem . "
finland is a case in point , according to schwab .
currently , the minimum warranty period across europe is two and a half years but in the nordic country it 's 10 .
" this is costly and there is really no proof that a warranty that long is really helpful , " schwab told deutsche welle .
" but the finnish say ' this is our law and we wo n't sacrifice it for europe . " '
completely uncoordinated even consumer protection commissioner meglena kuneva , a big supporter of harmonization , acknowledges that the highest level of consumer protection does n't necessarily guarantee an optimal solution for consumers – especially if they end up footing the bill .
schwab expects eu members will initially find agreement in a few selected areas , such as return rights .
policymakers hope to reach some kind of consensus next month to move ahead with legislation early next year , but it 's unclear what they will achieve .
" we will move where we can and wait for proposals to bring the other areas in line later , " he said .
for those retailers unwilling to wait until rules and regulations are harmonized across europe , andreas duscha with the e-commerce center-handel in cologne recommended seeking legal support to be on the safe side .
" we urge retailers to work closely with lawyers and not just download some forms from the internet and draw up their own terms and conditions , " he told deutsche welle .

security is to be increased at all airports and train stations . germany 's interior minister has announced that security is being stepped up at airports and train stations across the country .
thomas de maiziere told reporters in berlin on wednesday that the move came in light of concrete information received , indicating that a terrorist attack was being planned for the end of november in germany .
" from today , there will be a visible police presence .
i thought it should be explained to citizens , " de maiziere said .
" there is reason for concern , but no reason for hysteria . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere : ' reason for concern , not hysteria ' de maiziere called on all citizens to be vigilant .
any unattended packages or bags should be reported to security officials . the increased alert applied to all of germany .
three scenarios the government did not provide any details , but security officials in berlin said three suspected threats had arisen . speaking on condition of anonymity , the officials said one involved senior al qaeda leader younis al mauretani , who was planning an operation against europe and the united states . the second involved a plot to carry out coordinated armed attacks similar to those that killed 166 people in the indian city of mumbai in 2008 .
indications emerged that between 15 and 25 militants were lying in wait in europe preparing for such a strike , potentially in germany , the officials said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the scenarios resembles the 2008 attacks in mumbai a third scenario pointed to sleeper cells already in germany , though no specific targets were identified . although the evidence pointed to a real threat , de maiziere called on germans to avoid overreating . " it is not cause and should not be cause for us to change our daily lives totally , " the minister said , comparing the situation to the security alarm surrounding germany 's federal elections in 2009 .
de maiziere said " a tip from an international partner after the yemen incident " alerted the interior ministry to the potential threat .
past threats from yemen earlier this month , the discovery of two us-bound parcel bombs sent via airmail from yemen raised new fears about security .
the parcel bombs coincided with package bombs sent by greek militants to chancellor angela merkel in berlin .
the german government responded by grounding all cargo planes originating from yemen , a ban that has since been lifted .
in october , de maiziere drew criticism after he warned against " alarmism " in the wake of travel alerts for europe issued by the united states , britain and japan .

among other things , vasconcelos addressed the outlook for european engagement in afghanistan .
deutsche welle : the war in afghanistan is now in its ninth year and the original goal of establishing a democracy there is all but gone .
europeans have been deeply skeptical of the afghan mission for a long time .
could europe do more in afghanistan ?
alvaro de vasconcelos : we can do more .
but to do more we should do it in a civilian way .
we are going to have the nato summit in a few days and the temptation will be to say the civilian training in afghanistan must be done by nato itself because the europeans are not doing as much as necessary and the americans will essentially work through nato .
i think this is as mistake .
because this will make civilians become part of a military operation .
we need to delink the civilian from the military .
of course the military is needed to guarantee the protection of the civilian training .
but we need to train the police in a different way then we train the military .
the police are trained to protect people , so we need to move toward this core aspect - human security and strategy where the main objective is to protect the civilians in afghanistan and not to kill the enemy .
because as president obama from day one said we should not be in afghanistan to kill civilians , but to protect them .
do you think europeans would support sending more police trainers to afghanistan ?
i think if there is a clear shift in the strategy in afghanistan in that we say we are not there to win a war , we are there to build an afghan state , an afghan army , an afghan police force , this would be welcome , because the people in europe want their soldiers home .
most public opinion polls in europe show that the majority of people want their soldiers back as soon as possible .
so if you devise a strategy that will bring your troops home - which is what president obama has announced - and you show that this is a crisis management and state-building operation that involves the united nations to a larger degree , that will get much more support in europe .
there has been a lot of debate in the past years whether or not the west should talk to the taliban .
what is your opinion ?
my sense is that there is more or less a consensus now in europe , and i think also in the united states , that there is a need for a political process .
you can speak about talking to taliban in two ways : one is to say we are talking with the good taliban .
we would then be dividing the taliban leadership by talking to local leaders and this would be a kind of counterinsurgency strategy .
this was used in iraq .
but the essential problem is that the taliban leadership will still be there and will still have a lot of support in some areas of the country and it will still be able to make war and create enormous difficulties to the international coalition . the other is to start communication at the highest level of the taliban in afghanistan .
but if you -lrb- do that , -rrb- the biggest difficulty is to decide what we want from them .
are we prepared to have the taliban in power again in kabul ?
what would be the impact of that in international public opinion - but especially in europe and the united states ?
the role of president karzai is a very contentious issue , which came up again recently after he confirmed reports that he was regularly accepting large sums of cash from iran .
is karzai for europe and the us still the best option to lead afghanistan ?
so far he is the only option .
no one has found a better option for afghanistan up to now .
we know that the elections were not very transparent and that it is important now to establish legitimacy and credibility .
but karzai is in power now , the election results were accepted after lots of doubts , and the europeans and the americans as well as the international community are now working with him .
and he is a very skillfull politician with many connections in afghanistan and he knows the country well , so he can start the process of talking with the taliban .
so he certainly is and will be playing an important political role .

many countries use similar warning systems , first developed in the us . terror alert levels reflect the existing threat of an imminent terrorist attack , though such danger can hardly be measured .
the us department of homeland security developed such an advisory system following the september 11 attacks .
authorities raise the threat level to " high " - or in the worst case " severe " - if they receive pertinent information from their own intelligence service or other security authorities .
they also rely on intelligence data from other countries they work closely with .
this can involve tapped conversations , respective information in the internet or credible leads from informants in the jihadist scene .
it is very rarely based on a concrete lead .
members of german intelligence services recently questioned islamists in afghanistan for an entire week about terror scenarios in germany and europe .
according to security authorities , some 40 islamists from germany are currently residing in pakistan and afghanistan .
at the same time , around 200 specialists from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- have continued to work on verifying whether the latest terror warnings from the us are true .
this includes intensifying the surveillance of some 130 so-called " endangerers " living in germany .
various degrees of security measures normally , a collection of several indicators form a qualitative new threat situation .
this can result in a concrete terror alert officially announced to the public , in turn generally leading to increased controls at critical points in a country 's security structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere said new , tangible intelligence has come to light in germany , the federal interior minister and his counterparts in the individual states are responsible for this move .
the scope of possible measures to resort to range from ordering increased passenger and luggage controls at airports , monitoring train stations and major road junctions to temporarily closing embassies at particularly vulnerable locations .
in the united states , the government set up the five-tiered color-coded threat level system to protect against future accusations that security authorities did n't take information about the imminent 9/11 attacks seriously enough and inform the public .
germany 's interior minister thomas de maiziere probably had similar thoughts in his mind .
continual warnings last month , authorities discovered two us-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen , one of which went through cologne-bonn airport in western germany undetected .
it turned out that lufthansa had already tipped off the interior ministry about the terrorist threat from yemen .
the airline 's warning reportedly reached de maiziere already at the beginning of october - three weeks before the package bombs were found in europe .
in recent weeks , german media have also repeatedly reported on alleged imminent terrorist attacks in the us and europe .
in addition , there have been continual warnings by western intelligence services that terrorists could plan an attack still before christmas - though the al qaeda network has in the past liked to publicly spread such warnings for propaganda purposes .
other governments have also reacted with official terror warnings to the supposed changed security situation .
germany is the third eu nation after britain and france to announce such a warning to its population .

this power play has caused poland many headaches .
but new know-how in gas production could mark a turn in events . practically every winter , russia and its neighbors ukraine and belarus disagree on gas supply technicalities .
this dispute has endangered deliveries to poland .
the baltic sea pipeline , which will connect western european markets with major russian gas fields , has made matters worse .
warsaw 's politicians feel they will be at moscow 's mercy because russia can then shut off the supply without endangering its deliveries to germany .
but this headache could soon be over .
the largest deposits of shale gas in europe are assumed to be located on polish territory .
new technology from the united states could make it possible to exploit these gas reserves .
test drillings are planned all across the country .
according to geologists , poland could become the largest gas supplier in europe after norway and russia .
it would make the eastern european country rich - much richer than previously assumed , said energy expert pawel nierada from the sobieski institute in warsaw .
" conservative estimates already show that poland could suddenly become a serious exporter on the european gas market , " nierada said .
" the reserves exceed our country 's consumption many times over .
it 's hard to imagine what it would be like if the more optimistic estimates of the us government were to turn out to be true .
then , here in poland , we would have more gas than norway . "
skeptics question new technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland could soon control its own gas distribution natural gas which is produced in europe and asia has so far been relatively easy to access .
it lies in enormous bubbles under impermeable layers of earth , for example out of clay .
shale gas , on the other hand , is located in the middle of rock beds .
it 's nothing new that this valuable resource exists there .
but no one was ever interested in it before , because production was considered to be difficult and therefore uneconomical .
but that has changed .
in the united states , shale gas already covers 20 percent of gas consumption .
new technology used over the past few years has made this possible .
special drills first make their way into the ground vertically and then , when they reach the rock bed with the gas , bend into a horizontal position .
there , they pump a chemical liquid into the ground , which causes the rock bed to burst open .
the gas can then flow .
but many people are skeptical about this procedure , nierada said .
" there are also critical voices which say that the technology is still in its infancy - the experts from the russian gas company gazprom , for example , " he said .
" but in the united states , the production works .
and international firms believe it will be successful in poland , too .
otherwise , they would n't have already invested so much money in licenses and test drilling . "
the polish government has already issued some 60 licenses for test drillings , mainly to american companies .
it 's no wonder that this is cause for concern further to the east - in moscow .
after all , gas exports make up a significant part of russia 's gross domestic product .
they could stagnate or even decrease as a result of the polish finds .
gazprom has already admitted that it is n't able to sell as much to the united states as it used to because of the shale gas reserves there .
in a report , the company even said shale gas could " fundamentally change " the worldwide gas market .
us film highlights drawbacks us officials have billed shale gas a clean alternative , which could dominate the gas market by 2030 .
but despite its growing use there , shale gas extraction has caused controversy .
the hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , used to force out the gas has been a point of debate . earlier this year , the environmental protection agency asked gas companies to reveal what chemicals are used in deep extraction , addressing concerns by residents that the fracking had contaminated their drinking water . in the documentary " gasland , " which won the special jury prize at this year 's sundance film festival , filmmaker josh fox showed families in a drilling area whose tap water was even flammable . in addition , environmentalists have pointed out that the cleaner burning effects of shale gas were lessened when factoring in the energy expended to extract and transport it .
lack of political support production in poland could begin in ten years at the earliest , gas companies said .
but experts think it could start earlier .
then , the country could fulfill a dream it has had for hundreds of years : to be economically - and therefore also politically - independent from russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chevron is one of several us companies who have bought shale gas licenses in poland in spite of that , though , politicians across the spectrum have been slamming on the brakes , such as economics minister waldemar pawlak .
" up till now , shale gas has been more of a media phenomenon , " pawlak said .
" we still do n't know how difficult it will be to produce in poland .
it will also be more expensive than gas from conventional sources , because more drilling is necessary for the same amount of output . "
poland 's president bronislaw komorowski has been skeptical , too .
he said that all those production towers across the country would be an eyesore .
economic factors drive skepticism even if there are factual reasons for the skepticism , experts have long criticized polish politicians for being too passive .
for years , poland has relied on imports from russia without even considering the exploitation at least of conventional gas resources in the country .
this was mainly due to the monopoly of the state-owned gas firm pgnig .
" the company was never interested in producing gas itself , " nierada said .
" it earned its money very easily , after all , by buying gas from russia and simply adding its margin .
the company did n't care about how high the final price was . "
this passivity is now costing poland dearly .
in order to have enough gas for the coming winter , the state-owned company had to close a deal with gazprom for additional gas deliveries .
it even risked a battle with the eu commission , as brussels said russia was dictating unacceptable conditions .
the two sides finally reached an agreement at the end of october ensuring deliveries of russian natural gas until 2022 .
but such problems will possibly no longer exist in a few years - at least , not if poland turns into a european kuwait .

there , they pump a chemical liquid into the ground , which causes the rock bed to burst open .
the gas can then flow .
but many people are skeptical about this procedure , nierada said .
" there are also critical voices which say that the technology is still in its infancy - the experts from the russian gas company gazprom , for example , " he said .
" but in the united states , the production works .
and international firms believe it will be successful in poland , too .
otherwise , they would n't have already invested so much money in licenses and test drilling . "
the polish government has already issued some 60 licenses for test drillings , mainly to american companies .
it 's no wonder that this is cause for concern further to the east - in moscow .
after all , gas exports make up a significant part of russia 's gross domestic product .
they could stagnate or even decrease as a result of the polish finds .
gazprom has already admitted that it is n't able to sell as much to the united states as it used to because of the shale gas reserves there .
in a report , the company even said shale gas could " fundamentally change " the worldwide gas market .
us film highlights drawbacks us officials have billed shale gas a clean alternative , which could dominate the gas market by 2030 .
but despite its growing use there , shale gas extraction has caused controversy .
the hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , used to force out the gas has been a point of debate . earlier this year , the environmental protection agency asked gas companies to reveal what chemicals are used in deep extraction , addressing concerns by residents that the fracking had contaminated their drinking water . in the documentary " gasland , " which won the special jury prize at this year 's sundance film festival , filmmaker josh fox showed families in a drilling area whose tap water was even flammable . in addition , environmentalists have pointed out that the cleaner burning effects of shale gas were lessened when factoring in the energy expended to extract and transport it .
lack of political support production in poland could begin in ten years at the earliest , gas companies said .
but experts think it could start earlier .
then , the country could fulfill a dream it has had for hundreds of years : to be economically - and therefore also politically - independent from russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chevron is one of several us companies who have bought shale gas licenses in poland in spite of that , though , politicians across the spectrum have been slamming on the brakes , such as economics minister waldemar pawlak .
" up till now , shale gas has been more of a media phenomenon , " pawlak said .
" we still do n't know how difficult it will be to produce in poland .
it will also be more expensive than gas from conventional sources , because more drilling is necessary for the same amount of output . "
poland 's president bronislaw komorowski has been skeptical , too .
he said that all those production towers across the country would be an eyesore .
economic factors drive skepticism even if there are factual reasons for the skepticism , experts have long criticized polish politicians for being too passive .
for years , poland has relied on imports from russia without even considering the exploitation at least of conventional gas resources in the country .
this was mainly due to the monopoly of the state-owned gas firm pgnig .
" the company was never interested in producing gas itself , " nierada said .
" it earned its money very easily , after all , by buying gas from russia and simply adding its margin .
the company did n't care about how high the final price was . "
this passivity is now costing poland dearly .
in order to have enough gas for the coming winter , the state-owned company had to close a deal with gazprom for additional gas deliveries .
it even risked a battle with the eu commission , as brussels said russia was dictating unacceptable conditions .
the two sides finally reached an agreement at the end of october ensuring deliveries of russian natural gas until 2022 .
but such problems will possibly no longer exist in a few years - at least , not if poland turns into a european kuwait .

this power play has caused poland many headaches .
but new know-how in gas production could mark a turn in events . practically every winter , russia and its neighbors ukraine and belarus disagree on gas supply technicalities .
this dispute has endangered deliveries to poland .
the baltic sea pipeline , which will connect western european markets with major russian gas fields , has made matters worse .
warsaw 's politicians feel they will be at moscow 's mercy because russia can then shut off the supply without endangering its deliveries to germany .
but this headache could soon be over .
the largest deposits of shale gas in europe are assumed to be located on polish territory .
new technology from the united states could make it possible to exploit these gas reserves .
test drillings are planned all across the country .
according to geologists , poland could become the largest gas supplier in europe after norway and russia .
it would make the eastern european country rich - much richer than previously assumed , said energy expert pawel nierada from the sobieski institute in warsaw .
" conservative estimates already show that poland could suddenly become a serious exporter on the european gas market , " nierada said .
" the reserves exceed our country 's consumption many times over .
it 's hard to imagine what it would be like if the more optimistic estimates of the us government were to turn out to be true .
then , here in poland , we would have more gas than norway . "
skeptics question new technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland could soon control its own gas distribution natural gas which is produced in europe and asia has so far been relatively easy to access .
it lies in enormous bubbles under impermeable layers of earth , for example out of clay .
shale gas , on the other hand , is located in the middle of rock beds .
it 's nothing new that this valuable resource exists there .
but no one was ever interested in it before , because production was considered to be difficult and therefore uneconomical .
but that has changed .
in the united states , shale gas already covers 20 percent of gas consumption .
new technology used over the past few years has made this possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 17.11.2010 european e-commerce struggles to cross borders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans increasingly embrace e-commerce european consumers are showing more interest in buying goods online from other nations , and more retailers want to sell their wares across borders , too .
but plenty of hurdles still hinder e-commerce in europe . e-commerce is taking off domestically in many european countries , including germany .
but few companies in the region have ventured beyond their home markets to sell their products via the internet to consumers in other countries .
a patchwork of rules regulating consumer transactions across europe continues to inhibit many retailers from selling abroad .
and , unfortunately , a quick fix is not in sight .
" more than two thirds of retailers in -lrb- germany -rrb- say they do n't use the internet to sell abroad largely because they are unfamiliar with the legal situation in the various countries , " nikolaus lindner , a legal expert at the german subsidiary of ebay , told deutsche welle .
widening gap germany is hardly alone .
the gap between domestic and international e-commerce across the eu is widening as a result of cross-border barriers to online trade , according to the european commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebay is among the companies calling for harmonized rules and regulations from 2006 to 2008 , the share of all eu consumers who bought at least one item domestically over the internet increased from 27 percent to 33 percent , while cross-border e-commerce rose only marginally from 6 percent to 7 percent .
yet demand for cross-border service exists : one third of all eu citizens indicate they would consider buying a product from another member state via the internet because it 's cheaper or better or not available in their home country .
consumers and retailers hope the european commission 's proposed consumer rights directive will help clear the way for cross-border e-commerce .
the directive tackles , among other things , the prickly issue of legal fragmentation in areas such as product returns , guarantees and intellectual property rights as well as rules for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste .
big roadblock missing in this lineup , however , is value-added tax , which can vary widely from state to state .
many retailers see it as a significant obstacle to selling abroad .
the problem is , such taxes are a member-state issue , still outside the scope of eu legislation .
ebay 's lindner argues retailers would be much more willing to engage in cross-border selling if the risks of failing to comply with various national regulations could be eliminated through rules at the eu-level .
the cost of fragmentation , he says , is a heavy burden on business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission hopes to harmonize laws to boost e-commerce for many , full harmonization is the ultimate goal .
but it 's proving to be a true tug-of-war .
harmonization is among the most debated issues in both european parliament sessions and meetings of representatives of national ministries in the european council .
many parliament members see a form of " targeted harmonization " as the way forward .
" the problem is consumer protection rules have not been developed across europe in any organized fashion but in a completely uncoordinated way , " said andreas schwab , a member of the european parliament .
" you ca n't put into a policy paper that you will always take the highest level consumer protection from all states because that creates a problem . "
finland is a case in point , according to schwab .
currently , the minimum warranty period across europe is two and a half years but in the nordic country it 's 10 .
" this is costly and there is really no proof that a warranty that long is really helpful , " schwab told deutsche welle .
" but the finnish say ' this is our law and we wo n't sacrifice it for europe . " '
completely uncoordinated even consumer protection commissioner meglena kuneva , a big supporter of harmonization , acknowledges that the highest level of consumer protection does n't necessarily guarantee an optimal solution for consumers – especially if they end up footing the bill .
schwab expects eu members will initially find agreement in a few selected areas , such as return rights .
policymakers hope to reach some kind of consensus next month to move ahead with legislation early next year , but it 's unclear what they will achieve .
" we will move where we can and wait for proposals to bring the other areas in line later , " he said .
for those retailers unwilling to wait until rules and regulations are harmonized across europe , andreas duscha with the e-commerce center-handel in cologne recommended seeking legal support to be on the safe side .
" we urge retailers to work closely with lawyers and not just download some forms from the internet and draw up their own terms and conditions , " he told deutsche welle .

among other things , vasconcelos addressed the outlook for european engagement in afghanistan .
deutsche welle : the war in afghanistan is now in its ninth year and the original goal of establishing a democracy there is all but gone .
europeans have been deeply skeptical of the afghan mission for a long time .
could europe do more in afghanistan ?
alvaro de vasconcelos : we can do more .
but to do more we should do it in a civilian way .
we are going to have the nato summit in a few days and the temptation will be to say the civilian training in afghanistan must be done by nato itself because the europeans are not doing as much as necessary and the americans will essentially work through nato .
i think this is as mistake .
because this will make civilians become part of a military operation .
we need to delink the civilian from the military .
of course the military is needed to guarantee the protection of the civilian training .
but we need to train the police in a different way then we train the military .
the police are trained to protect people , so we need to move toward this core aspect - human security and strategy where the main objective is to protect the civilians in afghanistan and not to kill the enemy .
because as president obama from day one said we should not be in afghanistan to kill civilians , but to protect them .
do you think europeans would support sending more police trainers to afghanistan ?
i think if there is a clear shift in the strategy in afghanistan in that we say we are not there to win a war , we are there to build an afghan state , an afghan army , an afghan police force , this would be welcome , because the people in europe want their soldiers home .
most public opinion polls in europe show that the majority of people want their soldiers back as soon as possible .
so if you devise a strategy that will bring your troops home - which is what president obama has announced - and you show that this is a crisis management and state-building operation that involves the united nations to a larger degree , that will get much more support in europe .
there has been a lot of debate in the past years whether or not the west should talk to the taliban .
what is your opinion ?
my sense is that there is more or less a consensus now in europe , and i think also in the united states , that there is a need for a political process .
you can speak about talking to taliban in two ways : one is to say we are talking with the good taliban .
we would then be dividing the taliban leadership by talking to local leaders and this would be a kind of counterinsurgency strategy .
this was used in iraq .
but the essential problem is that the taliban leadership will still be there and will still have a lot of support in some areas of the country and it will still be able to make war and create enormous difficulties to the international coalition . the other is to start communication at the highest level of the taliban in afghanistan .
but if you -lrb- do that , -rrb- the biggest difficulty is to decide what we want from them .
are we prepared to have the taliban in power again in kabul ?
what would be the impact of that in international public opinion - but especially in europe and the united states ?
the role of president karzai is a very contentious issue , which came up again recently after he confirmed reports that he was regularly accepting large sums of cash from iran .
is karzai for europe and the us still the best option to lead afghanistan ?
so far he is the only option .
no one has found a better option for afghanistan up to now .
we know that the elections were not very transparent and that it is important now to establish legitimacy and credibility .
but karzai is in power now , the election results were accepted after lots of doubts , and the europeans and the americans as well as the international community are now working with him .
and he is a very skillfull politician with many connections in afghanistan and he knows the country well , so he can start the process of talking with the taliban .
so he certainly is and will be playing an important political role .

but to do more we should do it in a civilian way .
we are going to have the nato summit in a few days and the temptation will be to say the civilian training in afghanistan must be done by nato itself because the europeans are not doing as much as necessary and the americans will essentially work through nato .
i think this is as mistake .
because this will make civilians become part of a military operation .
we need to delink the civilian from the military .
of course the military is needed to guarantee the protection of the civilian training .
but we need to train the police in a different way then we train the military .
the police are trained to protect people , so we need to move toward this core aspect - human security and strategy where the main objective is to protect the civilians in afghanistan and not to kill the enemy .
because as president obama from day one said we should not be in afghanistan to kill civilians , but to protect them .
do you think europeans would support sending more police trainers to afghanistan ?
i think if there is a clear shift in the strategy in afghanistan in that we say we are not there to win a war , we are there to build an afghan state , an afghan army , an afghan police force , this would be welcome , because the people in europe want their soldiers home .
most public opinion polls in europe show that the majority of people want their soldiers back as soon as possible .
so if you devise a strategy that will bring your troops home - which is what president obama has announced - and you show that this is a crisis management and state-building operation that involves the united nations to a larger degree , that will get much more support in europe .
there has been a lot of debate in the past years whether or not the west should talk to the taliban .
what is your opinion ?
my sense is that there is more or less a consensus now in europe , and i think also in the united states , that there is a need for a political process .
you can speak about talking to taliban in two ways : one is to say we are talking with the good taliban .
we would then be dividing the taliban leadership by talking to local leaders and this would be a kind of counterinsurgency strategy .
this was used in iraq .
but the essential problem is that the taliban leadership will still be there and will still have a lot of support in some areas of the country and it will still be able to make war and create enormous difficulties to the international coalition . the other is to start communication at the highest level of the taliban in afghanistan .
but if you -lrb- do that , -rrb- the biggest difficulty is to decide what we want from them .
are we prepared to have the taliban in power again in kabul ?
what would be the impact of that in international public opinion - but especially in europe and the united states ?
the role of president karzai is a very contentious issue , which came up again recently after he confirmed reports that he was regularly accepting large sums of cash from iran .
is karzai for europe and the us still the best option to lead afghanistan ?
so far he is the only option .
no one has found a better option for afghanistan up to now .
we know that the elections were not very transparent and that it is important now to establish legitimacy and credibility .
but karzai is in power now , the election results were accepted after lots of doubts , and the europeans and the americans as well as the international community are now working with him .
and he is a very skillfull politician with many connections in afghanistan and he knows the country well , so he can start the process of talking with the taliban .
so he certainly is and will be playing an important political role .

many countries use similar warning systems , first developed in the us . terror alert levels reflect the existing threat of an imminent terrorist attack , though such danger can hardly be measured .
the us department of homeland security developed such an advisory system following the september 11 attacks .
authorities raise the threat level to " high " - or in the worst case " severe " - if they receive pertinent information from their own intelligence service or other security authorities .
they also rely on intelligence data from other countries they work closely with .
this can involve tapped conversations , respective information in the internet or credible leads from informants in the jihadist scene .
it is very rarely based on a concrete lead .
members of german intelligence services recently questioned islamists in afghanistan for an entire week about terror scenarios in germany and europe .
according to security authorities , some 40 islamists from germany are currently residing in pakistan and afghanistan .
at the same time , around 200 specialists from the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- and the federal office for the protection of the constitution -lrb- bfv -rrb- have continued to work on verifying whether the latest terror warnings from the us are true .
this includes intensifying the surveillance of some 130 so-called " endangerers " living in germany .
various degrees of security measures normally , a collection of several indicators form a qualitative new threat situation .
this can result in a concrete terror alert officially announced to the public , in turn generally leading to increased controls at critical points in a country 's security structure .

the scope of possible measures to resort to range from ordering increased passenger and luggage controls at airports , monitoring train stations and major road junctions to temporarily closing embassies at particularly vulnerable locations .
in the united states , the government set up the five-tiered color-coded threat level system to protect against future accusations that security authorities did n't take information about the imminent 9/11 attacks seriously enough and inform the public .
germany 's interior minister thomas de maiziere probably had similar thoughts in his mind .
continual warnings last month , authorities discovered two us-bound parcel bombs originating from yemen , one of which went through cologne-bonn airport in western germany undetected .
it turned out that lufthansa had already tipped off the interior ministry about the terrorist threat from yemen .
the airline 's warning reportedly reached de maiziere already at the beginning of october - three weeks before the package bombs were found in europe .
in recent weeks , german media have also repeatedly reported on alleged imminent terrorist attacks in the us and europe .
in addition , there have been continual warnings by western intelligence services that terrorists could plan an attack still before christmas - though the al qaeda network has in the past liked to publicly spread such warnings for propaganda purposes .
other governments have also reacted with official terror warnings to the supposed changed security situation .

both proponents and detractors are claiming to represent the interests of poor farmers . the mexican government first lifted its ban on experimental crops of genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- maize last year , freeing the way for field trials in the country where the crop was first domesticated . but , much like in europe where opposition to cultivating genetically modified crops has been strong , some small-scale farmers and environmental protection groups have criticized the government 's decision to add modified crops to the roughly 60 types of maize traditionally cultivated in mexico . for family farmers like rogelio sanchez , who lives in the village vicente guerrero , maize is more than just a crop and deserves to be protected from genetic alteration . " maize is sacred to us , " he said of the staple that has been cultivated in mexico for some 7,000 years .
" it 's the foundation of our diet and a part of our cultural identity that we inherited from our forefathers . " conflicting interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 60 sorts of maize cultivated in mexico a village of about 200 families , mostly working one-to-two-hectare subsistence farms , together with a group of farmers in vicente guerrero have joined forces to promote traditional farming methods that call for natural seeds , composting and no pesticides . the group 's agricultural methods are a far cry from the kind of agriculture being trialed in mexico 's north , although the government has n't yet given the green light to commercial production of gm maize , as it already has for genetically modified cotton . the modified maize would help farmers - especially cash-strapped small-time farmers - increase the size of their harvests without significantly increasing costs , according to ariel alvarez of mexico 's inter-secretarial commission on biosafety of genetically modified organisms -lrb- cibiogem -rrb- . " some people call it genetic contamination , but others say that this gene can help the people who need it most : small-time farmers , " he said . " the farmers who do n't have the money to buy pesticides and end up losing half of their harvests could benefit .
are we going to call that contamination ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters say gm maize would increase harvest sizes calming fears to help calm people 's fears about gm crops , alvarez and other officials recently opened the commission 's doors to inform the public and take questions . one of their arguments is that the government does not force farmers to buy and use the modified seeds sold by monsanto and other companies . the commission also claims that more research into genetically modified crops is necessary , and that it could become a substantial source of future income and transform mexico from a niche market into a global player . aleira lara of the environmental protection group greenpeace has , however , warned that the government risks opening a pandora 's box , because it is not known how the gm crops will affect indigenous varieties of maize . she added that mexico , the birthplace of corn crops , was a valuable country for biotech companies trying to win over regulators to their cause . " mexico is a symbol for monsanto , " she said .
" if they get permission for genetically modified maize here , it 's like a springboard for other countries where there has been opposition .

the former celtic tiger , meanwhile , insists it does n't need to be rescued . europe edged closer to its second bailout of a eurozone state on wednesday , as the bloc 's finance ministers announced a joint mission with the imf to ireland directed at stepping up talks on its devastated banking sector .
" the situation is very pressing and very , very serious and we do n't have any time to waste , " eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters after meetings in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they are talks , not bailout negotiations : lenihan " it is essential that confidence in the irish banking sector is restored for the sake of financial stability in europe and for the sake of restoring confidence in the economy . "
irish finance minister brian lenihan confirmed that the emergency talks would begin in dublin on thursday but issued no details on what shape the bailout could take or its possible size .
" we have agreed to look at the structural problems in the irish banks in the light of recent market pressures and assess what needs to be done because banking questions are technical and difficult , " lenihan told irish state radio on wednesday .
dublin reluctant to become ' europe 's lackey ' according to an article published in the wall street journal on wednesday , the irish banking sector is up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering for themselves .
investors fear the final figure could be even higher given rising mortgage arrears , deposit outflows and higher funding costs .
nevertheless , irish leaders continue to refuse that neither the country nor its banks are in need of a bailout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish do n't want to beg like the orphan , oliver twist " what we want to concentrate on now is in a focused way , over coming days , to sit down and see in what way can assistance be provided to ensure that these issues can be dealt with properly and appropriately , " prime minister brian cowen told parliament on wednesday after news of thursday 's emergency talks had emerged .
" there has been no question of the government -lsb- being -rsb- in a negotiation for a bailout , " he said , dismissing the term as pejorative and referring to the fact that the state of ireland is pre-funded until the middle of next year .
meanwhile , the irish people share their prime minister 's resistance to financial assistance from brussels or anywhere else ; in the streets of the irish capital , a european bailout would be a downright " humiliation . "
sean , a 54-year-old , called it " the final insult to the good and decent people of this country , to go like a beggar in brussels and ask that very seasonal question - please sir , can i have some more ? " referring to the charles dickens character oliver twist .
another dubliner , adam , 42 , said it would be " the end of the independent irish republic . "
" i would rather be poor and free than a poor lackey of europe .
it 's time to stand up and be irish once again , " he added .
more eu members to require assistance ?
also on wednesday , eu finance ministers pledged to agree on stricter debt rules by mid-2011 , as well as on a new rescue fund for dangerously indebted countries such as greece - which received substantial eu funds earlier this year to avoid bankruptcy - and a number of other eurozone members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von rompuy : resolution of the crisis is critical for the eu portugal and spain , which are already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , have both alluded to budgetary difficulties .
as with ireland , however , there have been no requests for emergency funding as of yet .
but the ministers gave a clear signal that " determined and coordinated " action had to be taken to resolve the debt crisis that is threatening the future financial stability of europe and the 16-member , single-currency eurozone .
" if we do n't survive with the eurozone we will not survive with the european union , " european council president herman von rompuy said .

the former celtic tiger , meanwhile , insists it does n't need to be rescued . europe edged closer to its second bailout of a eurozone state on wednesday , as the bloc 's finance ministers announced a joint mission with the imf to ireland directed at stepping up talks on its devastated banking sector .
" the situation is very pressing and very , very serious and we do n't have any time to waste , " eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters after meetings in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they are talks , not bailout negotiations : lenihan " it is essential that confidence in the irish banking sector is restored for the sake of financial stability in europe and for the sake of restoring confidence in the economy . "
irish finance minister brian lenihan confirmed that the emergency talks would begin in dublin on thursday but issued no details on what shape the bailout could take or its possible size .
" we have agreed to look at the structural problems in the irish banks in the light of recent market pressures and assess what needs to be done because banking questions are technical and difficult , " lenihan told irish state radio on wednesday .
dublin reluctant to become ' europe 's lackey ' according to an article published in the wall street journal on wednesday , the irish banking sector is up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering for themselves .
investors fear the final figure could be even higher given rising mortgage arrears , deposit outflows and higher funding costs .
nevertheless , irish leaders continue to refuse that neither the country nor its banks are in need of a bailout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish do n't want to beg like the orphan , oliver twist " what we want to concentrate on now is in a focused way , over coming days , to sit down and see in what way can assistance be provided to ensure that these issues can be dealt with properly and appropriately , " prime minister brian cowen told parliament on wednesday after news of thursday 's emergency talks had emerged .
" there has been no question of the government -lsb- being -rsb- in a negotiation for a bailout , " he said , dismissing the term as pejorative and referring to the fact that the state of ireland is pre-funded until the middle of next year .
meanwhile , the irish people share their prime minister 's resistance to financial assistance from brussels or anywhere else ; in the streets of the irish capital , a european bailout would be a downright " humiliation . "
sean , a 54-year-old , called it " the final insult to the good and decent people of this country , to go like a beggar in brussels and ask that very seasonal question - please sir , can i have some more ? " referring to the charles dickens character oliver twist .
another dubliner , adam , 42 , said it would be " the end of the independent irish republic . "
" i would rather be poor and free than a poor lackey of europe .
it 's time to stand up and be irish once again , " he added .
more eu members to require assistance ?
also on wednesday , eu finance ministers pledged to agree on stricter debt rules by mid-2011 , as well as on a new rescue fund for dangerously indebted countries such as greece - which received substantial eu funds earlier this year to avoid bankruptcy - and a number of other eurozone members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von rompuy : resolution of the crisis is critical for the eu portugal and spain , which are already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , have both alluded to budgetary difficulties .
as with ireland , however , there have been no requests for emergency funding as of yet .
but the ministers gave a clear signal that " determined and coordinated " action had to be taken to resolve the debt crisis that is threatening the future financial stability of europe and the 16-member , single-currency eurozone .
" if we do n't survive with the eurozone we will not survive with the european union , " european council president herman von rompuy said .

but plenty of hurdles still hinder e-commerce in europe . e-commerce is taking off domestically in many european countries , including germany .
but few companies in the region have ventured beyond their home markets to sell their products via the internet to consumers in other countries .
a patchwork of rules regulating consumer transactions across europe continues to inhibit many retailers from selling abroad .
and , unfortunately , a quick fix is not in sight .
" more than two thirds of retailers in -lrb- germany -rrb- say they do n't use the internet to sell abroad largely because they are unfamiliar with the legal situation in the various countries , " nikolaus lindner , a legal expert at the german subsidiary of ebay , told deutsche welle .
widening gap germany is hardly alone .
the gap between domestic and international e-commerce across the eu is widening as a result of cross-border barriers to online trade , according to the european commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebay is among the companies calling for harmonized rules and regulations from 2006 to 2008 , the share of all eu consumers who bought at least one item domestically over the internet increased from 27 percent to 33 percent , while cross-border e-commerce rose only marginally from 6 percent to 7 percent .
yet demand for cross-border service exists : one third of all eu citizens indicate they would consider buying a product from another member state via the internet because it 's cheaper or better or not available in their home country .
consumers and retailers hope the european commission 's proposed consumer rights directive will help clear the way for cross-border e-commerce .
the directive tackles , among other things , the prickly issue of legal fragmentation in areas such as product returns , guarantees and intellectual property rights as well as rules for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste .
big roadblock missing in this lineup , however , is value-added tax , which can vary widely from state to state .
many retailers see it as a significant obstacle to selling abroad .
the problem is , such taxes are a member-state issue , still outside the scope of eu legislation .
ebay 's lindner argues retailers would be much more willing to engage in cross-border selling if the risks of failing to comply with various national regulations could be eliminated through rules at the eu-level .
the cost of fragmentation , he says , is a heavy burden on business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission hopes to harmonize laws to boost e-commerce for many , full harmonization is the ultimate goal .
but it 's proving to be a true tug-of-war .
harmonization is among the most debated issues in both european parliament sessions and meetings of representatives of national ministries in the european council .
many parliament members see a form of " targeted harmonization " as the way forward .
" the problem is consumer protection rules have not been developed across europe in any organized fashion but in a completely uncoordinated way , " said andreas schwab , a member of the european parliament .
" you ca n't put into a policy paper that you will always take the highest level consumer protection from all states because that creates a problem . "
finland is a case in point , according to schwab .
currently , the minimum warranty period across europe is two and a half years but in the nordic country it 's 10 .
" this is costly and there is really no proof that a warranty that long is really helpful , " schwab told deutsche welle .
" but the finnish say ' this is our law and we wo n't sacrifice it for europe . " '
completely uncoordinated even consumer protection commissioner meglena kuneva , a big supporter of harmonization , acknowledges that the highest level of consumer protection does n't necessarily guarantee an optimal solution for consumers – especially if they end up footing the bill .
schwab expects eu members will initially find agreement in a few selected areas , such as return rights .
policymakers hope to reach some kind of consensus next month to move ahead with legislation early next year , but it 's unclear what they will achieve .
" we will move where we can and wait for proposals to bring the other areas in line later , " he said .
for those retailers unwilling to wait until rules and regulations are harmonized across europe , andreas duscha with the e-commerce center-handel in cologne recommended seeking legal support to be on the safe side .
" we urge retailers to work closely with lawyers and not just download some forms from the internet and draw up their own terms and conditions , " he told deutsche welle .

dw 's bernd riegert believes ireland should accept aid - fast . the longer you wait , the more costly it gets .
in view of its rampant national debt and heavily indebted banks , ireland will have to accept help from the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
it is only a matter of days , maybe hours .
the eu finance ministers ' plans are ready , but ireland has so far steadfastly resisted applying for a state bailout .
this is a case of misplaced pride on the part of the country 's stricken prime minister , brian cowen .
the former celtic tiger is about to be skinned . cowen did not want to take responsibility for such action in front of his shaken voters .
he also fears the strict conditions that loans entail .
ireland would probably have to raise its extremely low corporate taxes and aggravate the economic crisis further still . every day of hesitation forces the cost of loans on the financial markets to skyrocket , while share prices drop . ireland 's finance minister has finally admitted that the problems seem to have become too big for the small country .
the crisis does not only affect ireland , it affects all of europe .
after all , the european central bank has tirelessly been pumping money into the irish budget , where it buys government bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoid a chain reaction ireland is as good as bankrupt and the eu 's larger member states , including britain that does not have the euro as its currency , will have to help the nation in order to protect their own interests .
ireland is indebted for the most part to britain , germany , the us and france .
an irish insolvency would hit the banks in europe : for instance germany 's state-run hre bank .
it is clearly in europe 's own interest to save ireland - the sooner , the better .
a chain reaction might still be averted , although portugal and possibly spain also stand on the edge of a precipice .
that is what european council president herman van rompuy must have had in mind when he said that the 16 states of the eurozone and the entire eu are fighting for survival .
it is alarming that the financial markets are reacting with a drop in the price of government bonds to chancellor angela merkel 's remarks that private investors should share the costs of state insolvencies after 2013 . debtors want to make money , but they do n't want to carry the risks , and that has to stop .
however , financial markets and investors currently still have the upper hand .
they act and politics is forced to react by using taxpayers ' money to buy time for bankrupt states .
in essence , that is what the bailout is : a safety net .
whether this structure will manage to stabilize the european currency and the financial system remains to be seen .
we are in the midst of a huge experiment .
in the case of greece , 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- were pledged and about 40 billion have been paid .
the next installment ca n't be made because the country has n't completely fulfilled its obligations .
the next crisis is already on the horizon .
the safety net is beginning to tear .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoid a chain reaction ireland is as good as bankrupt and the eu 's larger member states , including britain that does not have the euro as its currency , will have to help the nation in order to protect their own interests .
ireland is indebted for the most part to britain , germany , the us and france .
an irish insolvency would hit the banks in europe : for instance germany 's state-run hre bank .
it is clearly in europe 's own interest to save ireland - the sooner , the better .
a chain reaction might still be averted , although portugal and possibly spain also stand on the edge of a precipice .
that is what european council president herman van rompuy must have had in mind when he said that the 16 states of the eurozone and the entire eu are fighting for survival .
it is alarming that the financial markets are reacting with a drop in the price of government bonds to chancellor angela merkel 's remarks that private investors should share the costs of state insolvencies after 2013 . debtors want to make money , but they do n't want to carry the risks , and that has to stop .
however , financial markets and investors currently still have the upper hand .
they act and politics is forced to react by using taxpayers ' money to buy time for bankrupt states .
in essence , that is what the bailout is : a safety net .
whether this structure will manage to stabilize the european currency and the financial system remains to be seen .
we are in the midst of a huge experiment .
in the case of greece , 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- were pledged and about 40 billion have been paid .
the next installment ca n't be made because the country has n't completely fulfilled its obligations .
the next crisis is already on the horizon .
the safety net is beginning to tear .

this power play has caused poland many headaches .
but new know-how in gas production could mark a turn in events . practically every winter , russia and its neighbors ukraine and belarus disagree on gas supply technicalities .
this dispute has endangered deliveries to poland .
the baltic sea pipeline , which will connect western european markets with major russian gas fields , has made matters worse .
warsaw 's politicians feel they will be at moscow 's mercy because russia can then shut off the supply without endangering its deliveries to germany .
but this headache could soon be over .
the largest deposits of shale gas in europe are assumed to be located on polish territory .
new technology from the united states could make it possible to exploit these gas reserves .
test drillings are planned all across the country .
according to geologists , poland could become the largest gas supplier in europe after norway and russia .
it would make the eastern european country rich - much richer than previously assumed , said energy expert pawel nierada from the sobieski institute in warsaw .
" conservative estimates already show that poland could suddenly become a serious exporter on the european gas market , " nierada said .
" the reserves exceed our country 's consumption many times over .
it 's hard to imagine what it would be like if the more optimistic estimates of the us government were to turn out to be true .
then , here in poland , we would have more gas than norway . "
skeptics question new technology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland could soon control its own gas distribution natural gas which is produced in europe and asia has so far been relatively easy to access .
it lies in enormous bubbles under impermeable layers of earth , for example out of clay .
shale gas , on the other hand , is located in the middle of rock beds .
it 's nothing new that this valuable resource exists there .
but no one was ever interested in it before , because production was considered to be difficult and therefore uneconomical .
but that has changed .
in the united states , shale gas already covers 20 percent of gas consumption .
new technology used over the past few years has made this possible .
special drills first make their way into the ground vertically and then , when they reach the rock bed with the gas , bend into a horizontal position .
there , they pump a chemical liquid into the ground , which causes the rock bed to burst open .
the gas can then flow .
but many people are skeptical about this procedure , nierada said .
" there are also critical voices which say that the technology is still in its infancy - the experts from the russian gas company gazprom , for example , " he said .
" but in the united states , the production works .
and international firms believe it will be successful in poland , too .
otherwise , they would n't have already invested so much money in licenses and test drilling . "
the polish government has already issued some 60 licenses for test drillings , mainly to american companies .
it 's no wonder that this is cause for concern further to the east - in moscow .
after all , gas exports make up a significant part of russia 's gross domestic product .
they could stagnate or even decrease as a result of the polish finds .
gazprom has already admitted that it is n't able to sell as much to the united states as it used to because of the shale gas reserves there .
in a report , the company even said shale gas could " fundamentally change " the worldwide gas market .
us film highlights drawbacks us officials have billed shale gas a clean alternative , which could dominate the gas market by 2030 .
but despite its growing use there , shale gas extraction has caused controversy .
the hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , used to force out the gas has been a point of debate . earlier this year , the environmental protection agency asked gas companies to reveal what chemicals are used in deep extraction , addressing concerns by residents that the fracking had contaminated their drinking water . in the documentary " gasland , " which won the special jury prize at this year 's sundance film festival , filmmaker josh fox showed families in a drilling area whose tap water was even flammable . in addition , environmentalists have pointed out that the cleaner burning effects of shale gas were lessened when factoring in the energy expended to extract and transport it .
lack of political support production in poland could begin in ten years at the earliest , gas companies said .
but experts think it could start earlier .
then , the country could fulfill a dream it has had for hundreds of years : to be economically - and therefore also politically - independent from russia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chevron is one of several us companies who have bought shale gas licenses in poland in spite of that , though , politicians across the spectrum have been slamming on the brakes , such as economics minister waldemar pawlak .
" up till now , shale gas has been more of a media phenomenon , " pawlak said .
" we still do n't know how difficult it will be to produce in poland .
it will also be more expensive than gas from conventional sources , because more drilling is necessary for the same amount of output . "
poland 's president bronislaw komorowski has been skeptical , too .
he said that all those production towers across the country would be an eyesore .
economic factors drive skepticism even if there are factual reasons for the skepticism , experts have long criticized polish politicians for being too passive .
for years , poland has relied on imports from russia without even considering the exploitation at least of conventional gas resources in the country .
this was mainly due to the monopoly of the state-owned gas firm pgnig .
" the company was never interested in producing gas itself , " nierada said .
" it earned its money very easily , after all , by buying gas from russia and simply adding its margin .
the company did n't care about how high the final price was . "
this passivity is now costing poland dearly .
in order to have enough gas for the coming winter , the state-owned company had to close a deal with gazprom for additional gas deliveries .
it even risked a battle with the eu commission , as brussels said russia was dictating unacceptable conditions .
the two sides finally reached an agreement at the end of october ensuring deliveries of russian natural gas until 2022 .
but such problems will possibly no longer exist in a few years - at least , not if poland turns into a european kuwait .

both proponents and detractors are claiming to represent the interests of poor farmers . the mexican government first lifted its ban on experimental crops of genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- maize last year , freeing the way for field trials in the country where the crop was first domesticated . but , much like in europe where opposition to cultivating genetically modified crops has been strong , some small-scale farmers and environmental protection groups have criticized the government 's decision to add modified crops to the roughly 60 types of maize traditionally cultivated in mexico . for family farmers like rogelio sanchez , who lives in the village vicente guerrero , maize is more than just a crop and deserves to be protected from genetic alteration . " maize is sacred to us , " he said of the staple that has been cultivated in mexico for some 7,000 years .
" it 's the foundation of our diet and a part of our cultural identity that we inherited from our forefathers . " conflicting interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 60 sorts of maize cultivated in mexico a village of about 200 families , mostly working one-to-two-hectare subsistence farms , together with a group of farmers in vicente guerrero have joined forces to promote traditional farming methods that call for natural seeds , composting and no pesticides . the group 's agricultural methods are a far cry from the kind of agriculture being trialed in mexico 's north , although the government has n't yet given the green light to commercial production of gm maize , as it already has for genetically modified cotton . the modified maize would help farmers - especially cash-strapped small-time farmers - increase the size of their harvests without significantly increasing costs , according to ariel alvarez of mexico 's inter-secretarial commission on biosafety of genetically modified organisms -lrb- cibiogem -rrb- . " some people call it genetic contamination , but others say that this gene can help the people who need it most : small-time farmers , " he said . " the farmers who do n't have the money to buy pesticides and end up losing half of their harvests could benefit .
are we going to call that contamination ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters say gm maize would increase harvest sizes calming fears to help calm people 's fears about gm crops , alvarez and other officials recently opened the commission 's doors to inform the public and take questions . one of their arguments is that the government does not force farmers to buy and use the modified seeds sold by monsanto and other companies . the commission also claims that more research into genetically modified crops is necessary , and that it could become a substantial source of future income and transform mexico from a niche market into a global player . aleira lara of the environmental protection group greenpeace has , however , warned that the government risks opening a pandora 's box , because it is not known how the gm crops will affect indigenous varieties of maize . she added that mexico , the birthplace of corn crops , was a valuable country for biotech companies trying to win over regulators to their cause . " mexico is a symbol for monsanto , " she said .
" if they get permission for genetically modified maize here , it 's like a springboard for other countries where there has been opposition .

deutsche welle spoke to the eu 's special envoy for myanmar , piero fassino . deutsche welle : myanmar 's military government released opposition leader aung san suu kyi after more than 15 years of detention .
how does the european union consider this move ? piero fassino : the most important thing , for her family and her people , is that aung san suu kyi is finally free .
what is also important is that she is enabled to come back to politics now , as myanmar is in a crucial and delicate phase .
elections have been held and a new parliament elected .
the new parliament will start working next february .
this will lead to a new civilian government , which should take over power from the military junta .
therefore , it could be the beginning of a period of political and institutional change and it is essential that suu kyi can participate as a major player in this new political phase . the recent elections were one step towards what the military rulers call " disciplined democracy . "
does the european union consider these elections to be truly democratic ? elections were held in a context that was strongly controlled and conditioned by the regime , according to dubious electoral laws and regulations , certainly not in line with european and international accepted standards . however , it needs also to be noted that during the electoral campaign civil society and opposition forces proved significantly lively .

in the framework of the current political transition , ethnic communities need to be fully associated to , and become part of , the political process . one of the essential issues to be dealt with in the context of the transition is precisely how to ensure the respect of the rights of the minorities , their autonomy and the possibility to participate in the life of the country without restraints . have the elections and the release of aung san suu kyi opened up a chance for a transformation process ? the release of aung san suu kyi is a first step .
now more steps into the right direction are needed : the release of all political detainees and the opening of a true , meaningful dialogue between the junta , the democratic opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities . in her first public speech after her release , aung san suu kyi explicitly urged the authorities to start a dialogue and expressed her availability to take up responsibilities in the management of the transition .
such a dialogue has to be free , honest and needs to aim at a definitive democratic transition allowing myanmar to reach those standards of freedom and democracy which are the mark of all free nations .
how will the eu press the government of myanmar towards a more pluralistic system ? we should not take anything for granted .

therefore , we need a policy aimed at increasing our relations with myanmar . we must increase humanitarian assistance particularly in those areas devastated by the nargis typhoon , where reconstruction and rehabilitation is needed .
we must increase development aid in vital sectors for the burmese people , such as water , education , health and assistance to children .
we must also help civil society to structure itself and accompany myanmar in building up the democratic institutions that it has never had so far . interview : ana lehman editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 17.11.2010 genetically modified corn takes root in mexico großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm maize has been planted in mexican test fields biotech companies have been experimenting with varieties of gm corn in mexico ever since the lifting of a moratorium on the crops .
both proponents and detractors are claiming to represent the interests of poor farmers . the mexican government first lifted its ban on experimental crops of genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- maize last year , freeing the way for field trials in the country where the crop was first domesticated . but , much like in europe where opposition to cultivating genetically modified crops has been strong , some small-scale farmers and environmental protection groups have criticized the government 's decision to add modified crops to the roughly 60 types of maize traditionally cultivated in mexico . for family farmers like rogelio sanchez , who lives in the village vicente guerrero , maize is more than just a crop and deserves to be protected from genetic alteration . " maize is sacred to us , " he said of the staple that has been cultivated in mexico for some 7,000 years .
" it 's the foundation of our diet and a part of our cultural identity that we inherited from our forefathers . " conflicting interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 60 sorts of maize cultivated in mexico a village of about 200 families , mostly working one-to-two-hectare subsistence farms , together with a group of farmers in vicente guerrero have joined forces to promote traditional farming methods that call for natural seeds , composting and no pesticides . the group 's agricultural methods are a far cry from the kind of agriculture being trialed in mexico 's north , although the government has n't yet given the green light to commercial production of gm maize , as it already has for genetically modified cotton . the modified maize would help farmers - especially cash-strapped small-time farmers - increase the size of their harvests without significantly increasing costs , according to ariel alvarez of mexico 's inter-secretarial commission on biosafety of genetically modified organisms -lrb- cibiogem -rrb- . " some people call it genetic contamination , but others say that this gene can help the people who need it most : small-time farmers , " he said . " the farmers who do n't have the money to buy pesticides and end up losing half of their harvests could benefit .
are we going to call that contamination ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters say gm maize would increase harvest sizes calming fears to help calm people 's fears about gm crops , alvarez and other officials recently opened the commission 's doors to inform the public and take questions . one of their arguments is that the government does not force farmers to buy and use the modified seeds sold by monsanto and other companies . the commission also claims that more research into genetically modified crops is necessary , and that it could become a substantial source of future income and transform mexico from a niche market into a global player . aleira lara of the environmental protection group greenpeace has , however , warned that the government risks opening a pandora 's box , because it is not known how the gm crops will affect indigenous varieties of maize . she added that mexico , the birthplace of corn crops , was a valuable country for biotech companies trying to win over regulators to their cause . " mexico is a symbol for monsanto , " she said .
" if they get permission for genetically modified maize here , it 's like a springboard for other countries where there has been opposition .

" the earliest best evidence for hominin butchery thus remains at 2.6 to 2.5 -lsb- million years -rsb- , " they wrote in their report . dikika researchers respond the dikika research project authors have rejected the new report , saying that the dominguez-rodrigo-led study did not explain away the marks , and have questioned that team ’ s methodology . " manuel dominguez-rodrigo did not look microscopically at the bones , " mcpherron told deutsche welle . " instead , he looked at our photos , many of which are taken microscopically .
there is a very large difference between the two .
thus , for instance , they are obliged to re-assess our description of the v-shape of some marks from our photos whereas in our original publication we had three independent analysts each look at the actual marks . " however , dominguez-rodrigo rejects their rebuttal , and the exchange has become a scientific tit-for-tat . " mcpherron et al argues that the marks we published from our trampling experiments are only superficially similar to the dikika marks , " he said . " this statement is incorrect and experts in our field will appreciate that properly .
we have published in more detail than mcpherron et al have the macroscopic and microscopic characteristics that make both the fossils and trampling marks virtually impossible to differentiate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 17.11.2010 genetically modified corn takes root in mexico großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm maize has been planted in mexican test fields biotech companies have been experimenting with varieties of gm corn in mexico ever since the lifting of a moratorium on the crops .
both proponents and detractors are claiming to represent the interests of poor farmers . the mexican government first lifted its ban on experimental crops of genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- maize last year , freeing the way for field trials in the country where the crop was first domesticated . but , much like in europe where opposition to cultivating genetically modified crops has been strong , some small-scale farmers and environmental protection groups have criticized the government 's decision to add modified crops to the roughly 60 types of maize traditionally cultivated in mexico . for family farmers like rogelio sanchez , who lives in the village vicente guerrero , maize is more than just a crop and deserves to be protected from genetic alteration . " maize is sacred to us , " he said of the staple that has been cultivated in mexico for some 7,000 years .
" it 's the foundation of our diet and a part of our cultural identity that we inherited from our forefathers . " conflicting interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are some 60 sorts of maize cultivated in mexico a village of about 200 families , mostly working one-to-two-hectare subsistence farms , together with a group of farmers in vicente guerrero have joined forces to promote traditional farming methods that call for natural seeds , composting and no pesticides . the group 's agricultural methods are a far cry from the kind of agriculture being trialed in mexico 's north , although the government has n't yet given the green light to commercial production of gm maize , as it already has for genetically modified cotton . the modified maize would help farmers - especially cash-strapped small-time farmers - increase the size of their harvests without significantly increasing costs , according to ariel alvarez of mexico 's inter-secretarial commission on biosafety of genetically modified organisms -lrb- cibiogem -rrb- . " some people call it genetic contamination , but others say that this gene can help the people who need it most : small-time farmers , " he said . " the farmers who do n't have the money to buy pesticides and end up losing half of their harvests could benefit .
are we going to call that contamination ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters say gm maize would increase harvest sizes calming fears to help calm people 's fears about gm crops , alvarez and other officials recently opened the commission 's doors to inform the public and take questions . one of their arguments is that the government does not force farmers to buy and use the modified seeds sold by monsanto and other companies . the commission also claims that more research into genetically modified crops is necessary , and that it could become a substantial source of future income and transform mexico from a niche market into a global player . aleira lara of the environmental protection group greenpeace has , however , warned that the government risks opening a pandora 's box , because it is not known how the gm crops will affect indigenous varieties of maize . she added that mexico , the birthplace of corn crops , was a valuable country for biotech companies trying to win over regulators to their cause . " mexico is a symbol for monsanto , " she said .
" if they get permission for genetically modified maize here , it 's like a springboard for other countries where there has been opposition .

sparks could fly in the wake of a recent investigation implicating the regulators in mismanagement . representatives of the 48-member international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- have begun a 10-day meeting in the french capital to seek a compromise between boosting stocks of the dwindling atlantic bluefin tuna species and salvaging a multi-billion dollar industry spread across the mediterranean .
gemma parkes , a spokesperson for wwf mediterranean , said iccat is under increased pressure to impose further restrictions after a ban on bluefin tuna fishing failed to pass earlier this year .
" it 's showdown time for iccat - time to prove what they can do , " parkes told deutsche welle from the meeting in paris .
the wwf is an official observer of the iccat meeting and is allowed to sit through some of the meetings and sometimes intervene .
it 's unclear as yet just how radical iccat 's decisions will be on bluefin catch-quotas for next year .
iccat 's scientific committee said last month that extending the 2010 catch limit for each of the next three years would give bluefin in the eastern atlantic and mediterranean a 63-percent chance of attaining so-called " maximum sustainable yield " by 2022 .
the fishing industry supports this continuation of the current recovery program , but says additional cuts could devastate the fishing industry .
competing interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists have taken direct action to stop purse seining in the mediterranean .
" the fishing sector is already in a delicate situation .
a reduction in quotas could destroy companies and have ramifications far beyond just the vessel .
there are many industries relying on a vessel , like the harbor , traders and transport , " javier garat , president of europeche , a european organization which defends the interests of fishing enterprises , told deutsche welle .
environmental groups are pressing for much lower limits .
" a 60 % chance of recovery is n't good enough .
it 's not acceptable to allow for a 40 % chance of collapse .
who would get on a plane that only has a 40 % chance of arriving at its destination ? "
parkes said .
the wwf is pushing for quotas to be cut from 13,500 to between zero and 6,000 tons .
that they say would at least give stocks an 85 % chance of recovery by 2022 .
" we are also urging for an end to purse-seining and the establishment of ' no fishing zones ' in spawning areas , " gemma parkes added .
purse-seine fishing in the mediterranean traps bluefin – and other by-catch - in floating drawstring nets that loop around an enormous areas .
it can capture thousands of fish at once , which are then hauled to coastal " farms " where they are fattened for market .
wwf , along with ngos oceana , greenpeace , and the pew environment group , have called for a ban on this kind of fishing .
garat from europeche defends the practice and said " there 's no problem with purse-seine fishing as long as it complies with quotas . "
a ban on purse-seine fishing " is a realistic scenario , " said fabio hazin , chairman of the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- at a discussion forum .
rule breaking the meeting comes at a sensitive time for iccat , which came under fire in an investigative report earlier this month for failing to monitor the bluefin fishing industry effectively .
the report by the international consortium of investigative journalists -lrb- icij -rrb- painted a bleak picture of over-exploitation in the tuna trade .
" there has been a depressingly widespread lack of control and respect for rules , " parkes said .
she says that iccat " needs to be able to enforce the rules " .
the fishing industry fiercely denies breaking the rules .
" fishermen have made a huge sacrifice to comply with the recovery plan .
evidence shows that compliance with the recovery plan is very strict , " javier garat said .
iccat is expected to discuss the findings of the report pertaining to infringements of its rules during the meeting in paris .

the japanese consume 80 percent of the atlantic bluefin catch , with americans appetites accounting for nine percent .
iccat member-states disagreed sharply going into the meeting as to whether next year 's quotas should remain at 13,500 tons , or be cut in half , or even suspended .
france 's fisheries minister , bruno le maire , said his country favored maintaining the 13,500 quota , a position backed by spain and italy .
britain and germany , along with eu fisheries commissioner maria damanaki , have come out in favor of a sharp reduction .
the european union was supposed to forge a common position going into the meeting , but has so far failed to do so .
" it 's going to be a tough two weeks .
tuna trading has a strong lobby that wants to keep the status quo .
we 're hopeful of a positive outcome and there 's a lot of international support on our side , " parkes said .
europeche president garat said the industry was facing increasingly stiff opposition .

iccat 's scientific committee said last month that extending the 2010 catch limit for each of the next three years would give bluefin in the eastern atlantic and mediterranean a 63-percent chance of attaining so-called " maximum sustainable yield " by 2022 .
the fishing industry supports this continuation of the current recovery program , but says additional cuts could devastate the fishing industry .
competing interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace activists have taken direct action to stop purse seining in the mediterranean .
" the fishing sector is already in a delicate situation .
a reduction in quotas could destroy companies and have ramifications far beyond just the vessel .
there are many industries relying on a vessel , like the harbor , traders and transport , " javier garat , president of europeche , a european organization which defends the interests of fishing enterprises , told deutsche welle .
environmental groups are pressing for much lower limits .
" a 60 % chance of recovery is n't good enough .
it 's not acceptable to allow for a 40 % chance of collapse .
who would get on a plane that only has a 40 % chance of arriving at its destination ? "
parkes said .
the wwf is pushing for quotas to be cut from 13,500 to between zero and 6,000 tons .
that they say would at least give stocks an 85 % chance of recovery by 2022 .
" we are also urging for an end to purse-seining and the establishment of ' no fishing zones ' in spawning areas , " gemma parkes added .
purse-seine fishing in the mediterranean traps bluefin – and other by-catch - in floating drawstring nets that loop around an enormous areas .
it can capture thousands of fish at once , which are then hauled to coastal " farms " where they are fattened for market .
wwf , along with ngos oceana , greenpeace , and the pew environment group , have called for a ban on this kind of fishing .
garat from europeche defends the practice and said " there 's no problem with purse-seine fishing as long as it complies with quotas . "
a ban on purse-seine fishing " is a realistic scenario , " said fabio hazin , chairman of the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tunas -lrb- iccat -rrb- at a discussion forum .
rule breaking the meeting comes at a sensitive time for iccat , which came under fire in an investigative report earlier this month for failing to monitor the bluefin fishing industry effectively .
the report by the international consortium of investigative journalists -lrb- icij -rrb- painted a bleak picture of over-exploitation in the tuna trade .
" there has been a depressingly widespread lack of control and respect for rules , " parkes said .
she says that iccat " needs to be able to enforce the rules " .
the fishing industry fiercely denies breaking the rules .
" fishermen have made a huge sacrifice to comply with the recovery plan .
evidence shows that compliance with the recovery plan is very strict , " javier garat said .
iccat is expected to discuss the findings of the report pertaining to infringements of its rules during the meeting in paris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's appetite for sushi has fuelled the bluefish tuna industry threatened species driven by wholesale prices in japan that can top 100,000 dollars per specimen , industrial-scale fishing in the mediterranean and eastern atlantic has depleted stocks by almost three quarters over the past four decades , while the size of the average captured bluefin tuna has almost halved .
the japanese consume 80 percent of the atlantic bluefin catch , with americans appetites accounting for nine percent .
iccat member-states disagreed sharply going into the meeting as to whether next year 's quotas should remain at 13,500 tons , or be cut in half , or even suspended .
france 's fisheries minister , bruno le maire , said his country favored maintaining the 13,500 quota , a position backed by spain and italy .
britain and germany , along with eu fisheries commissioner maria damanaki , have come out in favor of a sharp reduction .
the european union was supposed to forge a common position going into the meeting , but has so far failed to do so .
" it 's going to be a tough two weeks .
tuna trading has a strong lobby that wants to keep the status quo .
we 're hopeful of a positive outcome and there 's a lot of international support on our side , " parkes said .
europeche president garat said the industry was facing increasingly stiff opposition .
" we have noticed that the pressure from ngos and is very big . "

the former celtic tiger , meanwhile , insists it does n't need to be rescued . europe edged closer to its second bailout of a eurozone state on wednesday , as the bloc 's finance ministers announced a joint mission with the imf to ireland directed at stepping up talks on its devastated banking sector .
" the situation is very pressing and very , very serious and we do n't have any time to waste , " eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters after meetings in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they are talks , not bailout negotiations : lenihan " it is essential that confidence in the irish banking sector is restored for the sake of financial stability in europe and for the sake of restoring confidence in the economy . "
irish finance minister brian lenihan confirmed that the emergency talks would begin in dublin on thursday but issued no details on what shape the bailout could take or its possible size .
" we have agreed to look at the structural problems in the irish banks in the light of recent market pressures and assess what needs to be done because banking questions are technical and difficult , " lenihan told irish state radio on wednesday .
dublin reluctant to become ' europe 's lackey ' according to an article published in the wall street journal on wednesday , the irish banking sector is up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering for themselves .
investors fear the final figure could be even higher given rising mortgage arrears , deposit outflows and higher funding costs .
nevertheless , irish leaders continue to refuse that neither the country nor its banks are in need of a bailout .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the irish do n't want to beg like the orphan , oliver twist " what we want to concentrate on now is in a focused way , over coming days , to sit down and see in what way can assistance be provided to ensure that these issues can be dealt with properly and appropriately , " prime minister brian cowen told parliament on wednesday after news of thursday 's emergency talks had emerged .
" there has been no question of the government -lsb- being -rsb- in a negotiation for a bailout , " he said , dismissing the term as pejorative and referring to the fact that the state of ireland is pre-funded until the middle of next year .
meanwhile , the irish people share their prime minister 's resistance to financial assistance from brussels or anywhere else ; in the streets of the irish capital , a european bailout would be a downright " humiliation . "
sean , a 54-year-old , called it " the final insult to the good and decent people of this country , to go like a beggar in brussels and ask that very seasonal question - please sir , can i have some more ? " referring to the charles dickens character oliver twist .
another dubliner , adam , 42 , said it would be " the end of the independent irish republic . "
" i would rather be poor and free than a poor lackey of europe .
it 's time to stand up and be irish once again , " he added .
more eu members to require assistance ?
also on wednesday , eu finance ministers pledged to agree on stricter debt rules by mid-2011 , as well as on a new rescue fund for dangerously indebted countries such as greece - which received substantial eu funds earlier this year to avoid bankruptcy - and a number of other eurozone members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von rompuy : resolution of the crisis is critical for the eu portugal and spain , which are already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , have both alluded to budgetary difficulties .
as with ireland , however , there have been no requests for emergency funding as of yet .
but the ministers gave a clear signal that " determined and coordinated " action had to be taken to resolve the debt crisis that is threatening the future financial stability of europe and the 16-member , single-currency eurozone .
" if we do n't survive with the eurozone we will not survive with the european union , " european council president herman von rompuy said .

but the chief of the german central bank says banks should prepare for changes now . if there 's one thing the bankers and regulators gathered at the euro finance week in frankfurt agree on , it is that reform on a national level alone wo n't do much to stabilize the financial industry .
instead , they say that loopholes need to be plugged on an international level .
the german-centric economic forum started on monday , and there has been little doubt among attendees that action should be taken even before the stricter capital requirements of basel iii take effect in 2013 .
financial systems should be made more stable and resilient , they say .
german central bank president axel weber singled out german public-sector banks in his remarks .
" i believe , particularly in this sector , that the mikado-strategy that 's been pursued so far is leading nowhere , " weber said .
two such banks – bayernlb and westlb – recently failed in a merger attempt after receiving billions of taxpayer euros during the crisis .
the european commission set a new deadline of february 2011 for westlb to come up with ideas of how to sustain itself in the long term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels has given westlb a three-month deadline for restructuring weber said banks should n't be sluggish about making changes , and that they need to be proactive in preparing for coming regulations .
" changes will be coming to the market structure , " he said .
" there will be further changes .
the profiles of the actors will change , and the type and scope of the banking business will be affected .
" the refinancing structure of the banking system will change .
eventually there will also be less actors .
several will drop out – those which can not meet these new capital requirements . "
bankers have often complained about having to carry the high costs of the new regulations , but weber said that " a more stable financial system is worth the price . "
risks to international competition deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann spoke out against the notion of additional capital requirements for banks in germany , saying international competition is a concern .
what is needed is a method in which " banks which are a burden for the system – and therefore also taxpayers – can be eliminated , " he said .
" when you go to singapore , hong kong or shanghai today , then you experience what 's meant by location competition , " he said .
" and i believe we should always consider here what options we have to make the entire system more robust above all , but without giving up location advantages or tolerating location disadvantages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's ackermann defended big banking ackermann also defended large banking from skeptics who say banks were granted bailouts specifically because they had become too large to be allowed to fail .
" it is absolutely necessary that we define ourselves beyond national boundaries , " he said .
on monday a panel of economic journalists named ackermann ' european banker of the year ' for successfully leading his institution through the financial crisis .
asian banks ' ready ' according to wolfgang kirsch , ceo of dz bank , germany 's central cooperative bank , asian competitors are now primed and ready .
" after the asian crisis – this rough treatment which , in part , we 've been experiencing these days – this was something asian banks went through , " he said .
" and today they can happily call out , ' basel iii is n't an issue for us . '
anyone who says basel iii is n't an issue clearly has his own capital and liquidity .
and both of those things want to be utilized .
so we should keep an eye on that . "
the german central bank 's weber , however , foresees the need for regulation beyond just the banking system .
he said financial groups funneled billions of euros past regulators , agitating the financial crisis .
" we need to cast light into the shadows of the banking system , " he said .

dw 's bernd riegert believes ireland should accept aid - fast . the longer you wait , the more costly it gets .
in view of its rampant national debt and heavily indebted banks , ireland will have to accept help from the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
it is only a matter of days , maybe hours .
the eu finance ministers ' plans are ready , but ireland has so far steadfastly resisted applying for a state bailout .
this is a case of misplaced pride on the part of the country 's stricken prime minister , brian cowen .
the former celtic tiger is about to be skinned . cowen did not want to take responsibility for such action in front of his shaken voters .
he also fears the strict conditions that loans entail .
ireland would probably have to raise its extremely low corporate taxes and aggravate the economic crisis further still . every day of hesitation forces the cost of loans on the financial markets to skyrocket , while share prices drop . ireland 's finance minister has finally admitted that the problems seem to have become too big for the small country .
the crisis does not only affect ireland , it affects all of europe .
after all , the european central bank has tirelessly been pumping money into the irish budget , where it buys government bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoid a chain reaction ireland is as good as bankrupt and the eu 's larger member states , including britain that does not have the euro as its currency , will have to help the nation in order to protect their own interests .
ireland is indebted for the most part to britain , germany , the us and france .
an irish insolvency would hit the banks in europe : for instance germany 's state-run hre bank .
it is clearly in europe 's own interest to save ireland - the sooner , the better .
a chain reaction might still be averted , although portugal and possibly spain also stand on the edge of a precipice .
that is what european council president herman van rompuy must have had in mind when he said that the 16 states of the eurozone and the entire eu are fighting for survival .
it is alarming that the financial markets are reacting with a drop in the price of government bonds to chancellor angela merkel 's remarks that private investors should share the costs of state insolvencies after 2013 . debtors want to make money , but they do n't want to carry the risks , and that has to stop .
however , financial markets and investors currently still have the upper hand .
they act and politics is forced to react by using taxpayers ' money to buy time for bankrupt states .
in essence , that is what the bailout is : a safety net .
whether this structure will manage to stabilize the european currency and the financial system remains to be seen .
we are in the midst of a huge experiment .
in the case of greece , 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- were pledged and about 40 billion have been paid .
the next installment ca n't be made because the country has n't completely fulfilled its obligations .
the next crisis is already on the horizon .
the safety net is beginning to tear .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 17.11.2010 how to slaughter a digital sheep großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the e-sheep help pilgrims to give sacrificial meat to the needy does the feast of sacrifice mean that streets and squares in mecca are filled with slaughtered animals ?
no !
as dw reporter ali almakhlafi discovered , digital sheep are getting more and more popular . blood and dead sheep everywhere ?
spellbound pilgrims slaughtering live animals by the dozen ? that 's how a friend of mine imagined the feast of sacrifice .
and maybe some of dw 's readers thought so as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multicultural mecca : pilgrims from chad , china , lebanon , brazil , and austria i ca n't say that animal rights activists and vegetarians would enjoy what 's happening here – but the feast of sacrifice in mina is n't massacre-like , as my friend expected .
in accordance with islamic tradition , the sacrificial animals are slaughtered by a method called thaliba : their throats are cut and they bleed dry .
usually , this is done by a butcher or under professional instruction in one of the big butcheries .
the animals are definitively not being slaughtered on market squares , or even in front of a mosque .
the ritual took place on tuesday , november 16 , when muslims celebrated the feast of sacrifice .
however , animals are also sacrificed on the following two days of the hajj .
so far , however , i have n't seen any blood .
and that 's due to a new trend , which is quite popular in mecca , but also among turkish and arabic muslims living in germany : instead of sacrificing a real sheep , they sacrifice digital sheep - also called an electronic sheep or an e-sheep . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this sign indicates : ' no stone throwing ' i know it sounds funny , but it 's actually quite reasonable if you think about it .
on the one hand , muslims are supposed to sacrifice an animal during the hajj and then give the meat to the poor and needy .
on the other hand , there are n't all that many needy people in saudi arabia , at least not compared with other parts of the world , such as africa .
the idea is , you pay 400 rial -lrb- 80 euros -rrb- to a charitable foundation online , thereby purchasing a digital sheep .
the foundation will then make sure that a real sheep is slaughtered , and the meat is given to needy people in the respective country .
" i think that 's a great idea , " a saudi pilgrim tells me .
" what should we do with all the meat in our fridges ?
there are people who need it much more than we do . "
throwing stones at satan i 'm here as a journalist , so i did n't slaughter a sheep , not even a digital one .
but i wanted to at least stone the devil .
again , that all happened symbolically . on the hajj , pilgrims stone the devil numerous times .
it 's an important ritual , not only on the feast of sacrifice .
when throwing a stone , pilgrims speak out loud : " in the name of god , god is great . "
by doing so , they 're asking for god 's forgiveness for their sins .
the pilgrims have collected the stones they throw in the valley of muzdalifah .
2 million pilgrims arriving in mecca with 49 pebble stones each – that adds up to some 300 tons of stone .
after the hajj , saudi authorities make sure that the stones are transported back to muzdalifah .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i succeeded at ' stoning the devil ' a wall at one of the three pillars of jamarat bridge symbolizes the devil .
in fact , the huge bridge is a blessing for the hajj .
a couple of years ago , it was reconstructed as a five-story building with the help of german engineers .
now it 's a lot bigger , and also safer than before .
since it was rebuilt there have been no mass panics causing causalties , like there used to be .
a hair for every sin when the feast of sacrifice is over , pilgrims leave the state of consecration .
that was when i meet aaron from indonesia , who was holding scissors in his hand .
along with many other men here , he was about to have his head shaven .
shaving , or at least cutting ones hair , is an important part of the hajj .
i asked aaron why he wants to have his head shaven instead of just cutting off a little of his hair .
he said : " every hair on my head represents a sin to me .
and having my head shaved completely , it 's like being a newborn child – free of sins . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aaron from indonesia by the way , i discovered a funny aspect to the ritual .
there are , of course , men who have a bald head in the first place .
they either prefer a bald head or they lost their hair for some reason .
however , many of those men have their heads shaven symbolically , even though there 's really nothing to shave .
after the ritual , pilgrims take off their hajj garment and put on their everyday clothes .
and so i put on my jeans and polo shirt once again .
hajj attire " made in china " you might not have thought about the fact that many of the hajj clothes in mecca bear the label " made in china , " but they do .
muhammad , a pilgrim from china , told me that – and he 's very proud of it .
he 's part of the muslim minority in his country , which is even suppressed to some extent .
but muhammad still feels like a real chinese .
he told me he wished china would become the " world champion of global economy , " well , i guess china is heading in the right direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammad is proud that many hajj clothes are made in china again and again , i 'm excited by the international atmosphere over here .
i 'd like to answer a question posted by dw user detlev abebe , who wants to know : " what 's you 're impression of the majority of pilgrims ?
are they open-minded and tolerant – or do they just stick to a fixed ideology ? "
i would say it 's the former .
i definitely have n't seen anybody holding a fundamentalist speech in public .
most of the people here are just happy to experience a highly significant religious event together with pilgrims from around the world .
of course , the official saudi interpretation of islam is something different .
it 's very conservative , indeed .
yet , i 'm also surprised by how the conservative regulations are handled over here .
for example , there are rather strict rules for how men and women should interact with each other .
but they are n't taken that seriously by many pilgrims - especially when they 're not in public places .
and here 's another rather peculiar example : it 's illegal to sell cigarettes in mecca , but it 's allowed to smoke .
unveiled women i have n't found a definite answer to a question posted by dw user " milena " : " why is it that women are n't allowed to wear veils during the pilgrimage ? "
apparently , the rule says that women 's faces need to be recognizable during the hajj .
a religious scholar here told me that it probably goes back to how the prophets ' wives used to dress .
they were n't wearing veils .
and i personally think it could be a good sign that veils are n't a matter of religion , but a matter of tradition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 17.11.2010 bankers warn against overregulation at euro finance week großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks say tighter regulations could make them less competitive german bankers meeting in frankfurt say tighter risk-management rules could undermine their ability to compete against asian lenders .
but the chief of the german central bank says banks should prepare for changes now . if there 's one thing the bankers and regulators gathered at the euro finance week in frankfurt agree on , it is that reform on a national level alone wo n't do much to stabilize the financial industry .
instead , they say that loopholes need to be plugged on an international level .
the german-centric economic forum started on monday , and there has been little doubt among attendees that action should be taken even before the stricter capital requirements of basel iii take effect in 2013 .
financial systems should be made more stable and resilient , they say .
german central bank president axel weber singled out german public-sector banks in his remarks .
" i believe , particularly in this sector , that the mikado-strategy that 's been pursued so far is leading nowhere , " weber said .
two such banks – bayernlb and westlb – recently failed in a merger attempt after receiving billions of taxpayer euros during the crisis .
the european commission set a new deadline of february 2011 for westlb to come up with ideas of how to sustain itself in the long term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brussels has given westlb a three-month deadline for restructuring weber said banks should n't be sluggish about making changes , and that they need to be proactive in preparing for coming regulations .
" changes will be coming to the market structure , " he said .
" there will be further changes .
the profiles of the actors will change , and the type and scope of the banking business will be affected .
" the refinancing structure of the banking system will change .
eventually there will also be less actors .
several will drop out – those which can not meet these new capital requirements . "
bankers have often complained about having to carry the high costs of the new regulations , but weber said that " a more stable financial system is worth the price . "
risks to international competition deutsche bank ceo josef ackermann spoke out against the notion of additional capital requirements for banks in germany , saying international competition is a concern .
what is needed is a method in which " banks which are a burden for the system – and therefore also taxpayers – can be eliminated , " he said .
" when you go to singapore , hong kong or shanghai today , then you experience what 's meant by location competition , " he said .
" and i believe we should always consider here what options we have to make the entire system more robust above all , but without giving up location advantages or tolerating location disadvantages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's ackermann defended big banking ackermann also defended large banking from skeptics who say banks were granted bailouts specifically because they had become too large to be allowed to fail .
" it is absolutely necessary that we define ourselves beyond national boundaries , " he said .
on monday a panel of economic journalists named ackermann ' european banker of the year ' for successfully leading his institution through the financial crisis .
asian banks ' ready ' according to wolfgang kirsch , ceo of dz bank , germany 's central cooperative bank , asian competitors are now primed and ready .
" after the asian crisis – this rough treatment which , in part , we 've been experiencing these days – this was something asian banks went through , " he said .
" and today they can happily call out , ' basel iii is n't an issue for us . '
anyone who says basel iii is n't an issue clearly has his own capital and liquidity .
and both of those things want to be utilized .
so we should keep an eye on that . "
the german central bank 's weber , however , foresees the need for regulation beyond just the banking system .
he said financial groups funneled billions of euros past regulators , agitating the financial crisis .
" we need to cast light into the shadows of the banking system , " he said .

deutsche welle spoke to the eu 's special envoy for myanmar , piero fassino . deutsche welle : myanmar 's military government released opposition leader aung san suu kyi after more than 15 years of detention .
how does the european union consider this move ? piero fassino : the most important thing , for her family and her people , is that aung san suu kyi is finally free .
what is also important is that she is enabled to come back to politics now , as myanmar is in a crucial and delicate phase .
elections have been held and a new parliament elected .
the new parliament will start working next february .
this will lead to a new civilian government , which should take over power from the military junta .
therefore , it could be the beginning of a period of political and institutional change and it is essential that suu kyi can participate as a major player in this new political phase . the recent elections were one step towards what the military rulers call " disciplined democracy . "
does the european union consider these elections to be truly democratic ? elections were held in a context that was strongly controlled and conditioned by the regime , according to dubious electoral laws and regulations , certainly not in line with european and international accepted standards . however , it needs also to be noted that during the electoral campaign civil society and opposition forces proved significantly lively .
it is also relevant that , notwithstanding all the existing obstacles , opposition parties registered for the elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icon suu kyi has promised to look into poll irregularities it will be very important to see the results .
depending on how many elected representatives from the opposition forces and ethnic groups win seats in the local and national parliaments , we will be able to give a more complete evaluation of these elections . burma is a very multiethnic society .
what position does the eu have about the ethnic minorities ' struggle for more autonomy ? the european union condemns any form of hostility and oppression against ethnic minorities .
in the framework of the current political transition , ethnic communities need to be fully associated to , and become part of , the political process . one of the essential issues to be dealt with in the context of the transition is precisely how to ensure the respect of the rights of the minorities , their autonomy and the possibility to participate in the life of the country without restraints . have the elections and the release of aung san suu kyi opened up a chance for a transformation process ? the release of aung san suu kyi is a first step .
now more steps into the right direction are needed : the release of all political detainees and the opening of a true , meaningful dialogue between the junta , the democratic opposition and the representatives of the ethnic minorities . in her first public speech after her release , aung san suu kyi explicitly urged the authorities to start a dialogue and expressed her availability to take up responsibilities in the management of the transition .
such a dialogue has to be free , honest and needs to aim at a definitive democratic transition allowing myanmar to reach those standards of freedom and democracy which are the mark of all free nations .
how will the eu press the government of myanmar towards a more pluralistic system ? we should not take anything for granted .
we certainly hope that the release of aung san suu kyi can open a door , and it is for this reason that we are asking , after her release , for more meaningful acts , clearly showing the will of the authorities for a democratic transition . bildunterschrift : fassino calls for more aid for cyclone-devastated areas the international community must keep myanmar as a priority on its political agenda and must accompany and assist the democratic transition .
therefore , we need a policy aimed at increasing our relations with myanmar . we must increase humanitarian assistance particularly in those areas devastated by the nargis typhoon , where reconstruction and rehabilitation is needed .
we must increase development aid in vital sectors for the burmese people , such as water , education , health and assistance to children .
we must also help civil society to structure itself and accompany myanmar in building up the democratic institutions that it has never had so far . interview : ana lehman editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

among other things , vasconcelos addressed the outlook for european engagement in afghanistan .
deutsche welle : the war in afghanistan is now in its ninth year and the original goal of establishing a democracy there is all but gone .
europeans have been deeply skeptical of the afghan mission for a long time .
could europe do more in afghanistan ?
alvaro de vasconcelos : we can do more .
but to do more we should do it in a civilian way .
we are going to have the nato summit in a few days and the temptation will be to say the civilian training in afghanistan must be done by nato itself because the europeans are not doing as much as necessary and the americans will essentially work through nato .
i think this is as mistake .
because this will make civilians become part of a military operation .
we need to delink the civilian from the military .
of course the military is needed to guarantee the protection of the civilian training .
but we need to train the police in a different way then we train the military .
the police are trained to protect people , so we need to move toward this core aspect - human security and strategy where the main objective is to protect the civilians in afghanistan and not to kill the enemy .
because as president obama from day one said we should not be in afghanistan to kill civilians , but to protect them .
do you think europeans would support sending more police trainers to afghanistan ?
i think if there is a clear shift in the strategy in afghanistan in that we say we are not there to win a war , we are there to build an afghan state , an afghan army , an afghan police force , this would be welcome , because the people in europe want their soldiers home .
most public opinion polls in europe show that the majority of people want their soldiers back as soon as possible .
so if you devise a strategy that will bring your troops home - which is what president obama has announced - and you show that this is a crisis management and state-building operation that involves the united nations to a larger degree , that will get much more support in europe .
there has been a lot of debate in the past years whether or not the west should talk to the taliban .
what is your opinion ?
my sense is that there is more or less a consensus now in europe , and i think also in the united states , that there is a need for a political process .
you can speak about talking to taliban in two ways : one is to say we are talking with the good taliban .
we would then be dividing the taliban leadership by talking to local leaders and this would be a kind of counterinsurgency strategy .
this was used in iraq .
but the essential problem is that the taliban leadership will still be there and will still have a lot of support in some areas of the country and it will still be able to make war and create enormous difficulties to the international coalition . the other is to start communication at the highest level of the taliban in afghanistan .
but if you -lrb- do that , -rrb- the biggest difficulty is to decide what we want from them .
are we prepared to have the taliban in power again in kabul ?
what would be the impact of that in international public opinion - but especially in europe and the united states ?
the role of president karzai is a very contentious issue , which came up again recently after he confirmed reports that he was regularly accepting large sums of cash from iran .
is karzai for europe and the us still the best option to lead afghanistan ?
so far he is the only option .
no one has found a better option for afghanistan up to now .
we know that the elections were not very transparent and that it is important now to establish legitimacy and credibility .
but karzai is in power now , the election results were accepted after lots of doubts , and the europeans and the americans as well as the international community are now working with him .
and he is a very skillfull politician with many connections in afghanistan and he knows the country well , so he can start the process of talking with the taliban .
so he certainly is and will be playing an important political role .

no !
as dw reporter ali almakhlafi discovered , digital sheep are getting more and more popular . blood and dead sheep everywhere ?
spellbound pilgrims slaughtering live animals by the dozen ? that 's how a friend of mine imagined the feast of sacrifice .
and maybe some of dw 's readers thought so as well .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : multicultural mecca : pilgrims from chad , china , lebanon , brazil , and austria i ca n't say that animal rights activists and vegetarians would enjoy what 's happening here – but the feast of sacrifice in mina is n't massacre-like , as my friend expected .
in accordance with islamic tradition , the sacrificial animals are slaughtered by a method called thaliba : their throats are cut and they bleed dry .
usually , this is done by a butcher or under professional instruction in one of the big butcheries .
the animals are definitively not being slaughtered on market squares , or even in front of a mosque .
the ritual took place on tuesday , november 16 , when muslims celebrated the feast of sacrifice .
however , animals are also sacrificed on the following two days of the hajj .
so far , however , i have n't seen any blood .
and that 's due to a new trend , which is quite popular in mecca , but also among turkish and arabic muslims living in germany : instead of sacrificing a real sheep , they sacrifice digital sheep - also called an electronic sheep or an e-sheep . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this sign indicates : ' no stone throwing ' i know it sounds funny , but it 's actually quite reasonable if you think about it .
on the one hand , muslims are supposed to sacrifice an animal during the hajj and then give the meat to the poor and needy .
on the other hand , there are n't all that many needy people in saudi arabia , at least not compared with other parts of the world , such as africa .
the idea is , you pay 400 rial -lrb- 80 euros -rrb- to a charitable foundation online , thereby purchasing a digital sheep .
the foundation will then make sure that a real sheep is slaughtered , and the meat is given to needy people in the respective country .
" i think that 's a great idea , " a saudi pilgrim tells me .
" what should we do with all the meat in our fridges ?
there are people who need it much more than we do . "
throwing stones at satan i 'm here as a journalist , so i did n't slaughter a sheep , not even a digital one .
but i wanted to at least stone the devil .
again , that all happened symbolically . on the hajj , pilgrims stone the devil numerous times .
it 's an important ritual , not only on the feast of sacrifice .
when throwing a stone , pilgrims speak out loud : " in the name of god , god is great . "
by doing so , they 're asking for god 's forgiveness for their sins .
the pilgrims have collected the stones they throw in the valley of muzdalifah .
2 million pilgrims arriving in mecca with 49 pebble stones each – that adds up to some 300 tons of stone .
after the hajj , saudi authorities make sure that the stones are transported back to muzdalifah .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i succeeded at ' stoning the devil ' a wall at one of the three pillars of jamarat bridge symbolizes the devil .
in fact , the huge bridge is a blessing for the hajj .
a couple of years ago , it was reconstructed as a five-story building with the help of german engineers .
now it 's a lot bigger , and also safer than before .
since it was rebuilt there have been no mass panics causing causalties , like there used to be .
a hair for every sin when the feast of sacrifice is over , pilgrims leave the state of consecration .
that was when i meet aaron from indonesia , who was holding scissors in his hand .
along with many other men here , he was about to have his head shaven .
shaving , or at least cutting ones hair , is an important part of the hajj .
i asked aaron why he wants to have his head shaven instead of just cutting off a little of his hair .
he said : " every hair on my head represents a sin to me .
and having my head shaved completely , it 's like being a newborn child – free of sins . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aaron from indonesia by the way , i discovered a funny aspect to the ritual .
there are , of course , men who have a bald head in the first place .
they either prefer a bald head or they lost their hair for some reason .
however , many of those men have their heads shaven symbolically , even though there 's really nothing to shave .
after the ritual , pilgrims take off their hajj garment and put on their everyday clothes .
and so i put on my jeans and polo shirt once again .
hajj attire " made in china " you might not have thought about the fact that many of the hajj clothes in mecca bear the label " made in china , " but they do .
muhammad , a pilgrim from china , told me that – and he 's very proud of it .
he 's part of the muslim minority in his country , which is even suppressed to some extent .
but muhammad still feels like a real chinese .
he told me he wished china would become the " world champion of global economy , " well , i guess china is heading in the right direction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammad is proud that many hajj clothes are made in china again and again , i 'm excited by the international atmosphere over here .
i 'd like to answer a question posted by dw user detlev abebe , who wants to know : " what 's you 're impression of the majority of pilgrims ?
are they open-minded and tolerant – or do they just stick to a fixed ideology ? "
i would say it 's the former .
i definitely have n't seen anybody holding a fundamentalist speech in public .
most of the people here are just happy to experience a highly significant religious event together with pilgrims from around the world .
of course , the official saudi interpretation of islam is something different .
it 's very conservative , indeed .
yet , i 'm also surprised by how the conservative regulations are handled over here .
for example , there are rather strict rules for how men and women should interact with each other .
but they are n't taken that seriously by many pilgrims - especially when they 're not in public places .
and here 's another rather peculiar example : it 's illegal to sell cigarettes in mecca , but it 's allowed to smoke .
unveiled women i have n't found a definite answer to a question posted by dw user " milena " : " why is it that women are n't allowed to wear veils during the pilgrimage ? "
apparently , the rule says that women 's faces need to be recognizable during the hajj .
a religious scholar here told me that it probably goes back to how the prophets ' wives used to dress .
they were n't wearing veils .
and i personally think it could be a good sign that veils are n't a matter of religion , but a matter of tradition .

the former celtic tiger , meanwhile , insists it does n't need to be rescued . europe edged closer to its second bailout of a eurozone state on wednesday , as the bloc 's finance ministers announced a joint mission with the imf to ireland directed at stepping up talks on its devastated banking sector .
" the situation is very pressing and very , very serious and we do n't have any time to waste , " eu economic affairs commissioner olli rehn told reporters after meetings in brussels .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they are talks , not bailout negotiations : lenihan " it is essential that confidence in the irish banking sector is restored for the sake of financial stability in europe and for the sake of restoring confidence in the economy . "
irish finance minister brian lenihan confirmed that the emergency talks would begin in dublin on thursday but issued no details on what shape the bailout could take or its possible size .
" we have agreed to look at the structural problems in the irish banks in the light of recent market pressures and assess what needs to be done because banking questions are technical and difficult , " lenihan told irish state radio on wednesday .
dublin reluctant to become ' europe 's lackey ' according to an article published in the wall street journal on wednesday , the irish banking sector is up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- in debt , with financial experts in agreement that the banks are incapable of covering for themselves .
investors fear the final figure could be even higher given rising mortgage arrears , deposit outflows and higher funding costs .
nevertheless , irish leaders continue to refuse that neither the country nor its banks are in need of a bailout .

" there has been no question of the government -lsb- being -rsb- in a negotiation for a bailout , " he said , dismissing the term as pejorative and referring to the fact that the state of ireland is pre-funded until the middle of next year .
meanwhile , the irish people share their prime minister 's resistance to financial assistance from brussels or anywhere else ; in the streets of the irish capital , a european bailout would be a downright " humiliation . "
sean , a 54-year-old , called it " the final insult to the good and decent people of this country , to go like a beggar in brussels and ask that very seasonal question - please sir , can i have some more ? " referring to the charles dickens character oliver twist .
another dubliner , adam , 42 , said it would be " the end of the independent irish republic . "
" i would rather be poor and free than a poor lackey of europe .
it 's time to stand up and be irish once again , " he added .
more eu members to require assistance ?
also on wednesday , eu finance ministers pledged to agree on stricter debt rules by mid-2011 , as well as on a new rescue fund for dangerously indebted countries such as greece - which received substantial eu funds earlier this year to avoid bankruptcy - and a number of other eurozone members .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von rompuy : resolution of the crisis is critical for the eu portugal and spain , which are already unable to borrow money on open markets other than at prohibitive rates , have both alluded to budgetary difficulties .
as with ireland , however , there have been no requests for emergency funding as of yet .
but the ministers gave a clear signal that " determined and coordinated " action had to be taken to resolve the debt crisis that is threatening the future financial stability of europe and the 16-member , single-currency eurozone .
" if we do n't survive with the eurozone we will not survive with the european union , " european council president herman von rompuy said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 17.11.2010 opinion : ireland needs to accept help the sooner , the better großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurozone finance ministers are taking a hard look at ireland , the latest member to come under intense bond market pressure .
dw 's bernd riegert believes ireland should accept aid - fast . the longer you wait , the more costly it gets .
in view of its rampant national debt and heavily indebted banks , ireland will have to accept help from the eu and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
it is only a matter of days , maybe hours .
the eu finance ministers ' plans are ready , but ireland has so far steadfastly resisted applying for a state bailout .
this is a case of misplaced pride on the part of the country 's stricken prime minister , brian cowen .
the former celtic tiger is about to be skinned . cowen did not want to take responsibility for such action in front of his shaken voters .
he also fears the strict conditions that loans entail .
ireland would probably have to raise its extremely low corporate taxes and aggravate the economic crisis further still . every day of hesitation forces the cost of loans on the financial markets to skyrocket , while share prices drop . ireland 's finance minister has finally admitted that the problems seem to have become too big for the small country .
the crisis does not only affect ireland , it affects all of europe .
after all , the european central bank has tirelessly been pumping money into the irish budget , where it buys government bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : avoid a chain reaction ireland is as good as bankrupt and the eu 's larger member states , including britain that does not have the euro as its currency , will have to help the nation in order to protect their own interests .
ireland is indebted for the most part to britain , germany , the us and france .
an irish insolvency would hit the banks in europe : for instance germany 's state-run hre bank .
it is clearly in europe 's own interest to save ireland - the sooner , the better .
a chain reaction might still be averted , although portugal and possibly spain also stand on the edge of a precipice .
that is what european council president herman van rompuy must have had in mind when he said that the 16 states of the eurozone and the entire eu are fighting for survival .
it is alarming that the financial markets are reacting with a drop in the price of government bonds to chancellor angela merkel 's remarks that private investors should share the costs of state insolvencies after 2013 . debtors want to make money , but they do n't want to carry the risks , and that has to stop .
however , financial markets and investors currently still have the upper hand .
they act and politics is forced to react by using taxpayers ' money to buy time for bankrupt states .
in essence , that is what the bailout is : a safety net .
whether this structure will manage to stabilize the european currency and the financial system remains to be seen .
we are in the midst of a huge experiment .
in the case of greece , 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 150 billion -rrb- were pledged and about 40 billion have been paid .
the next installment ca n't be made because the country has n't completely fulfilled its obligations .
the next crisis is already on the horizon .
the safety net is beginning to tear .

a patchwork of rules regulating consumer transactions across europe continues to inhibit many retailers from selling abroad .
and , unfortunately , a quick fix is not in sight .
" more than two thirds of retailers in -lrb- germany -rrb- say they do n't use the internet to sell abroad largely because they are unfamiliar with the legal situation in the various countries , " nikolaus lindner , a legal expert at the german subsidiary of ebay , told deutsche welle .
widening gap germany is hardly alone .
the gap between domestic and international e-commerce across the eu is widening as a result of cross-border barriers to online trade , according to the european commission .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ebay is among the companies calling for harmonized rules and regulations from 2006 to 2008 , the share of all eu consumers who bought at least one item domestically over the internet increased from 27 percent to 33 percent , while cross-border e-commerce rose only marginally from 6 percent to 7 percent .
yet demand for cross-border service exists : one third of all eu citizens indicate they would consider buying a product from another member state via the internet because it 's cheaper or better or not available in their home country .
consumers and retailers hope the european commission 's proposed consumer rights directive will help clear the way for cross-border e-commerce .
the directive tackles , among other things , the prickly issue of legal fragmentation in areas such as product returns , guarantees and intellectual property rights as well as rules for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste .
big roadblock missing in this lineup , however , is value-added tax , which can vary widely from state to state .
many retailers see it as a significant obstacle to selling abroad .
the problem is , such taxes are a member-state issue , still outside the scope of eu legislation .
ebay 's lindner argues retailers would be much more willing to engage in cross-border selling if the risks of failing to comply with various national regulations could be eliminated through rules at the eu-level .
the cost of fragmentation , he says , is a heavy burden on business .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european commission hopes to harmonize laws to boost e-commerce for many , full harmonization is the ultimate goal .
but it 's proving to be a true tug-of-war .
harmonization is among the most debated issues in both european parliament sessions and meetings of representatives of national ministries in the european council .
many parliament members see a form of " targeted harmonization " as the way forward .
" the problem is consumer protection rules have not been developed across europe in any organized fashion but in a completely uncoordinated way , " said andreas schwab , a member of the european parliament .
" you ca n't put into a policy paper that you will always take the highest level consumer protection from all states because that creates a problem . "
finland is a case in point , according to schwab .
currently , the minimum warranty period across europe is two and a half years but in the nordic country it 's 10 .
" this is costly and there is really no proof that a warranty that long is really helpful , " schwab told deutsche welle .
" but the finnish say ' this is our law and we wo n't sacrifice it for europe . " '
completely uncoordinated even consumer protection commissioner meglena kuneva , a big supporter of harmonization , acknowledges that the highest level of consumer protection does n't necessarily guarantee an optimal solution for consumers – especially if they end up footing the bill .
schwab expects eu members will initially find agreement in a few selected areas , such as return rights .
policymakers hope to reach some kind of consensus next month to move ahead with legislation early next year , but it 's unclear what they will achieve .
" we will move where we can and wait for proposals to bring the other areas in line later , " he said .
for those retailers unwilling to wait until rules and regulations are harmonized across europe , andreas duscha with the e-commerce center-handel in cologne recommended seeking legal support to be on the safe side .
" we urge retailers to work closely with lawyers and not just download some forms from the internet and draw up their own terms and conditions , " he told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 17.11.2010 the pilgrimage to mecca : the hajj großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaaba at the holy mosque in mecca the hajj is the religious highlight of muslim life .
its order of events is predetermined in detail .
with about 2 million pilgrims visiting the holy sites of mecca within a few days , organizers have their hands full . it 's hot , it 's packed , and it may even be dangerous .
within a few days , about 2 million pilgrims visit the holy sites of mecca - a logistic feat that makes even the olympics or the soccer world cup look like a cakewalk . almost simultaneously , millions of pilgrims touch down at the airport in the nearby town of jeddah .
some 4,000 shuttle buses are in action .
desalination plants are working full blast in order to turn 130 million liters of water from the red sea into drinking water .
the hungry visitors devour 2 million loaves of bread every day .
and all that at temperatures near 40 degrees celsius -lrb- 104 degrees fahrenheit , -rrb- even though it is in the middle of november .
the biggest problem , however , is security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia 's capital riad , harbor city jeddah , and the holy city of mecca about 100,000 security forces try to cope with the masses of believers .
they watch over a territory that spans 25 kilometers -lrb- 15 miles -rrb- from west to east .
the most dangerous spot is jamarat bridge .
until a few years ago , hundreds of thousands of people , moving in different directions , crowded through the very confined space there .
often , there were mass panics with hundreds of people dying .
in 2006 , almost 400 people died in the turmoil .
but today the pilgrims ' routes no longer cross there , since the former bridge has been turned into a five-story building with a one-way system on multiple levels , including escape routes .
a large part of the planning was done by german engineers .
despite the strains , the hajj is mandatory for all pious muslims who are healthy enough and can afford to go .
why ?
because it is one of the five basic duties of islam , just like fasting during ramadan , and daily prayers .
those who have already performed the hajj may call themselves a hajji .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hajj is one of the basic duties of islam the hajj goes back to the prophet muhammad who made his pilgrimage to mecca in 632 .
it always starts on the same day of the year : the eighth day of the last month of the islamic lunar calendar , the so-called hijri calendar .
the order of events is predetermined in every detail .
the most important stages are : day 1 stage 1 : getting ready arriving in mecca , pilgrims prepare for the hajj both inwardly and outwardly by entering what is called the " state of consecration . "
men put on the pilgrim 's garment comprised of two white unlined cloths .
from now on , they are not allowed to shave , comb their hair , or cut their hair and nails .
women are not allowed to cover their faces with veils .
stage 2 : the holy mosque bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of pilgrims at mecca 's holy mosque after entering the state of consecration , pilgrims head towards the holy mosque , the al-haram mosque .
right in the middle of it , there 's the kaaba .
it 's a brick-built cube with 12 x 10 meters of floor space ; it is 14 meters high .
during the pilgrimage season , the kaaba is decorated with a black curtain made from silk .
a koranic verse is embroidered on it with golden threads .
the kaaba is the geographic center of islam : muslims turn towards it when they pray .
according to religious tradition , adam built the kaaba .
it was destroyed by the flood , but abraham and his son ishmael rebuilt it .
in a corner of the kaaba there is a black stone .
supposedly , abraham received it as a gift from archangel gabriel .
the silver-edged stone is as big as a human hand .
experts still argue about whether the stone is a meteorite from outer space or if it 's actually made of earthly material such as glass .
pilgrims walk around the black stone seven times counter- clockwise .
whoever gets close enough to the kaaba , despite the masses , may kiss it .
stage 3 : departure to mina after having circled the kaaba seven times , muslims head towards the nearby town of mina .
there they 'll find prepared tents for the pilgrims to spend the night .
day 2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain of forgiveness stage 4 : mount arafat starting from mina , the journey continues to mount arafat , 25 kilometers east of mecca .
it 's believed to be a mountain of forgiveness .
this stage is among the most emotional parts of the hajj .
pilgrims spend a whole day praying and contemplating .
they ask god for forgiveness for their sins .
stage 5 : departure to muzdalifah in the evening , pilgrims walk to the holy valley of muzdalifah .
here they collect stones that they will need for the symbolic stoning of the devil during the next stage .
pilgrims also spend their second night there .
day 3 stage 6 : return to mina and stoning of the devil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial picture of jamarat bridge pilgrims return to mina even before sunrise .
they make their way to jamarat bridge – with the term " bridge " to be taken loosely .
in fact , it 's a highly complex five-story building with various ramps and towers .
three pillars stand out of it and symbolize the devil .
the pilgrims throw their collected stones from muzdalifah at the largest of the three pillars .
this is how they symbolically stone the devil .
stage 7 : the feast of sacrifice every pilgrim with enough money to do so buys a sheep or a goat and butchers it on the same day .
this means that hundreds of thousands of animals are killed within few hours .
pilgrims donate most of the sacrificed animals to the needy .
the feast of sacrifice is among the most important islamic feasts and it is celebrated by believers all around the world .
stage 8 : lifting the state of consecration the pilgrims may leave the state of consecration now , by symbolically having their hair cut .
women only have a strand of their hair made shorter .
all pilgrims may also put on their everyday clothes again .
stage 9 : return to mecca once more , the pilgrims return to the holy mosque in mecca and circle the kaaba seven times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the covered walkway between the hills safa and marwa stage 10 : the " running " between the hills safa and marwa , pilgrims now walk back and forth seven times .
they are thereby reviving a biblical scene of the old testament , when abraham 's wife hagar was desperately looking for water to prevent her son from dying of thirst .
finally an angel came to her help and showed her the way to the rescuing fountain zamzam .
stage 11 : return to mina all pilgrims return to their tents in mina .
day 4 -6 stage 12 : stoning of the devil in mina in the following days , pilgrims stay in mina and perform other symbolic stonings of the devil .
stage 13 : farewell to mecca to finish the hajj , pilgrims circle the kaaba seven times for a last time .

the biggest problem , however , is security bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi arabia 's capital riad , harbor city jeddah , and the holy city of mecca about 100,000 security forces try to cope with the masses of believers .
they watch over a territory that spans 25 kilometers -lrb- 15 miles -rrb- from west to east .
the most dangerous spot is jamarat bridge .
until a few years ago , hundreds of thousands of people , moving in different directions , crowded through the very confined space there .
often , there were mass panics with hundreds of people dying .
in 2006 , almost 400 people died in the turmoil .
but today the pilgrims ' routes no longer cross there , since the former bridge has been turned into a five-story building with a one-way system on multiple levels , including escape routes .
a large part of the planning was done by german engineers .
despite the strains , the hajj is mandatory for all pious muslims who are healthy enough and can afford to go .
why ?
because it is one of the five basic duties of islam , just like fasting during ramadan , and daily prayers .
those who have already performed the hajj may call themselves a hajji .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hajj is one of the basic duties of islam the hajj goes back to the prophet muhammad who made his pilgrimage to mecca in 632 .
it always starts on the same day of the year : the eighth day of the last month of the islamic lunar calendar , the so-called hijri calendar .
the order of events is predetermined in every detail .
the most important stages are : day 1 stage 1 : getting ready arriving in mecca , pilgrims prepare for the hajj both inwardly and outwardly by entering what is called the " state of consecration . "
men put on the pilgrim 's garment comprised of two white unlined cloths .
from now on , they are not allowed to shave , comb their hair , or cut their hair and nails .
women are not allowed to cover their faces with veils .
stage 2 : the holy mosque bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : masses of pilgrims at mecca 's holy mosque after entering the state of consecration , pilgrims head towards the holy mosque , the al-haram mosque .
right in the middle of it , there 's the kaaba .
it 's a brick-built cube with 12 x 10 meters of floor space ; it is 14 meters high .
during the pilgrimage season , the kaaba is decorated with a black curtain made from silk .
a koranic verse is embroidered on it with golden threads .
the kaaba is the geographic center of islam : muslims turn towards it when they pray .
according to religious tradition , adam built the kaaba .
it was destroyed by the flood , but abraham and his son ishmael rebuilt it .
in a corner of the kaaba there is a black stone .
supposedly , abraham received it as a gift from archangel gabriel .
the silver-edged stone is as big as a human hand .
experts still argue about whether the stone is a meteorite from outer space or if it 's actually made of earthly material such as glass .
pilgrims walk around the black stone seven times counter- clockwise .
whoever gets close enough to the kaaba , despite the masses , may kiss it .
stage 3 : departure to mina after having circled the kaaba seven times , muslims head towards the nearby town of mina .
there they 'll find prepared tents for the pilgrims to spend the night .
day 2 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain of forgiveness stage 4 : mount arafat starting from mina , the journey continues to mount arafat , 25 kilometers east of mecca .
it 's believed to be a mountain of forgiveness .
this stage is among the most emotional parts of the hajj .
pilgrims spend a whole day praying and contemplating .
they ask god for forgiveness for their sins .
stage 5 : departure to muzdalifah in the evening , pilgrims walk to the holy valley of muzdalifah .
here they collect stones that they will need for the symbolic stoning of the devil during the next stage .
pilgrims also spend their second night there .
day 3 stage 6 : return to mina and stoning of the devil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial picture of jamarat bridge pilgrims return to mina even before sunrise .
they make their way to jamarat bridge – with the term " bridge " to be taken loosely .
in fact , it 's a highly complex five-story building with various ramps and towers .
three pillars stand out of it and symbolize the devil .
the pilgrims throw their collected stones from muzdalifah at the largest of the three pillars .
this is how they symbolically stone the devil .
stage 7 : the feast of sacrifice every pilgrim with enough money to do so buys a sheep or a goat and butchers it on the same day .
this means that hundreds of thousands of animals are killed within few hours .
pilgrims donate most of the sacrificed animals to the needy .
the feast of sacrifice is among the most important islamic feasts and it is celebrated by believers all around the world .
stage 8 : lifting the state of consecration the pilgrims may leave the state of consecration now , by symbolically having their hair cut .
women only have a strand of their hair made shorter .
all pilgrims may also put on their everyday clothes again .
stage 9 : return to mecca once more , the pilgrims return to the holy mosque in mecca and circle the kaaba seven times .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the covered walkway between the hills safa and marwa stage 10 : the " running " between the hills safa and marwa , pilgrims now walk back and forth seven times .
they are thereby reviving a biblical scene of the old testament , when abraham 's wife hagar was desperately looking for water to prevent her son from dying of thirst .
finally an angel came to her help and showed her the way to the rescuing fountain zamzam .
stage 11 : return to mina all pilgrims return to their tents in mina .
day 4 -6 stage 12 : stoning of the devil in mina in the following days , pilgrims stay in mina and perform other symbolic stonings of the devil .
stage 13 : farewell to mecca to finish the hajj , pilgrims circle the kaaba seven times for a last time .
