program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : interviews and portraits of top musicians bayreuth conductor andris nelsons : ' wagner opened my eyes for other composers ' baritone quasthoff : an unusual , successful career music is imaginary , says acclaimed composer elliott carter conductor ingo metzmacher aims to uncover " german soul " music -pipe- 28.08.2010 wagner 's ' ring ' is about the meaning of love , says tenor lance ryan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : now at bayreuth , lance ryan -lrb- far right -rrb- has appeared often as siegfried young tenor lance ryan gave his first performance at the bayreuth festival this year as siegfried .
he shared his thoughts with deutsche welle on the character of siegfried and performing at the celebrated festival . canadian lance ryan , who resides in karlsruhe , germany , first performed in germany in 2005 as " otello " at the staedtische buehnen muenster .
he 's sung at opera houses around the world , including at the vienna state opera and the frankfurt opera house .
a german opera magazine called him " sensational " in his role as siegfried in richard wagner 's opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung . " the 2010 bayreuth festival draws to a close on saturday , august 28 . deutsche welle : what path led to bayreuth for you ? lance ryan : i think it began with debuting the role of siegfried and initially having some success ; the word started to spread .
from what i understand , -lsb- bayreuth festival co-director -rsb- eva wagner-pasquier first heard me in stuttgart in " the flying dutchman , " and then she came to hear me once again in mulhouse when we were doing " siegfried . "
she really liked what she heard , and , at that point , a dialogue started to open between her and my agent . i think in september she first said they thought they needed a new siegfried for this coming summer .
it was short notice in operatic terms - 11 months - but i had the summer free , and i thought , " why not ? "
at that point , i also felt i owed something to frau wagner for spreading the good word about me and helping to propel me . on stage , you appear very natural in the role of siegfried .
do you feel natural despite the rather artificial situation of performing and singing at this energy level ? i think you have to find the enthusiasm , the energy and the youthfulness in siegfried .
there are many different aspects to the character , and that 's one of the reasons he 's fascinating to play .
you think back to being around 17 or 18 - the age siegfried is supposed to be - in that rebellious phase where you 're growing , and you want to get out and discover , but you really have no idea what you 're getting into .
that 's exactly what siegfried is .
once you kind of identify with that , everything else comes with it . it 's strange with wagner - it never strikes you right away what a great musician he is because the work is just so complex .
it 's so rich and dense that you have to sift through much material in order to find how he makes it work in such a genius way .
once you 've recognized all that , then you find the road , and it carries you .
in that way , it eventually does come naturally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryan said the bayreuth stage opens up possibilities unavailable elsewhere there 's certainly a heroic aspect to the music , and wagner said siegfried was his ultimate hero even though the character is adolescent and foolish .
why would siegfried be considered a hero ? it 's a great comparison when you take siegfried and siegmund , siegfried 's father .
siegmund had his father there to guide and teach him how to hunt and fight and deal with certain situations , but siegfried did n't have that .
he only had mime , this dwarf who never really loved him .
so i think one of the great tragedies in the work is that siegfried is a kind of dysfunctional character .
you have this boy with great potential but who is just born in tragic circumstances . i tend to think that wagner could identify that with his own history .
he recognized in himself what a great musician , dramatist and talent he was .
but early in his career , that was never recognized .
i think this inability to fulfill oneself in one 's youth is something he identified with , so maybe that 's why he feels siegfried was his greatest hero . i think that 's also one of the great lessons of the ring - to show what love really means and to show what can go wrong if it 's not nurtured between people . i imagine there is now a lot of demand for you to sing in new productions .
what priorities do you have musically ?
yes , there 's a lot of demand , and i have quite a few productions in view within the next five or six years .
but at the same time , i always want to keep a more lyrical side to the roles .
in the market , once you have a stamp or an identity , that 's what the theaters want because they want to say , " we have this singer in this role . "
it 's a marketing thing , and that 's just the way it is in modern society .
there 's a commercial aspect to it all now , in contrast to 100 years ago when there was more patronage . but i try to keep a balance for my vocal health and for artistic reasons .
i look for variety - something new and something lighter for my voice .
siegfried is good for my voice because the part is n't so deep .
its register still lies quite high , unlike tristan or parsifal .
with siegfried , you can keep the very tenor aspects , and when you do , i think the more heroic qualities come out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva wagner-pasquier -lrb- right -rrb- noticed ryan 's talent and helped recruit him for bayreuth how would you describe your first experience performing on the wagner stage ? it 's great - an amazing theater with an amazing acoustic .
i think the biggest difference for me was the way the orchestra pit is divided .
as a singer on stage , you hear the violins very clearly , but you do n't hear the horns and woodwinds as well as you normally would .
so , you have a different sound from the orchestra as an artist on stage , and you have to take note of that . other than that , the acoustic here gives you great confidence that you can do more vocally and artistically with color because you know the audience can almost always hear you .
like conductor christian thielemann has said , " you do n't have to sing so loud , we will adjust . "
that 's excellent to hear a conductor say that .
then you know you can play vocally - with lightness and color - and you do n't have to think " can the audience hear me ? " with this conductor and this stage , you feel that you can do things that you might not be able to do anywhere else .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kolat called on the government to act to remove sarrazin " i am calling upon the government to begin a procedure to remove thilo sarrazin from the board of the central bank , " kolat told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday , august 28 .
in his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , sarrazin claims that members of germany 's muslim community pose a danger to german society . sarrazin , a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and berlin 's former finance chief , was reported in june as saying that members of the turkish and arab community were making germany " more stupid . "
with his book , kolat said , sarrazin had overstepped a boundary .
" it is the climax of a new intellectual racism and it damages germany 's reputation abroad , " kolat said .
high birth-rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says that his book is addressing cultural division in a serialization of the forthcoming book in the german popular daily newspaper bild , sarrazin said that germany 's muslim community had profited from social welfare payments far more than they contributed , and that higher birth-rates among immigrants could lead to the muslim population overtaking the " indigenous " one in terms of numbers .
merkel 's chief spokesman steffen seibert said on wednesday that many people would find the remarks " offensive " and " defamatory , " adding that the chancellor was concerned .
members of the spd have distanced themselves from sarrazin 's comments , while germany 's green and left parties have called for his removal from the central bank 's board .
a bundesbank spokesman said that sarrazin 's latest remarks were personal opinions , unconnected with his role on the board .
blanket generalizations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first female muslim minister said the comments lacked respect lower saxony 's minister of social affairs , ayguel oezkan , germany 's first-ever female muslim minister , accused sarrazin of doing damage to the muslim community with blanket generalizations .
" there are a vast number of hard-working immigrants , " she told the weekly german newspaper bild am sonntag ahead of its publication on sunday .
" they deserve respect , not malice . "
" all of those who are involved in society , those who encourage their children , who learn german , who work and pay taxes and those who , as entrepreneurs , provide jobs – all of them deserve respect . "
in june , 65-year-old sarrazin was reported as saying that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because immigrants were poorly educated .
' distorted image , half-truths ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin claims german society is being undermined by the muslim community maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , accused sarrazin of giving " a distorted image of integration in germany " that did not bear up to academic scrutiny .
" in his comments , he states only half truths , " she told bild am sonntag .
" it is indisputable that , in education , there are currently a lot of immigrants with a lot of catching up to do .
it does not take sarrazin 's comments to establish that . "
in a lengthy interview with weekly newspaper die zeit , sarrazin defended himself against the charge he was encouraging racism .
" i am not a racist , " he told the newspaper .
" the book addresses cultural divisions , not ethnic ones . "
last year , sarrazin caused a storm by claiming that most of berlin 's arab and turkish immigrants had no useful function " apart from fruit and vegetable trading . "
as a result , the central bank stripped sarrazin of some of his duties .

the government faces resistance if it presses ahead . a study commissioned by the german government has recommended an extension of up to 20 years to the life of nuclear power plants , according to reports . experts from germany 's institute of energy economics at the university of cologne -lrb- ewi -rrb- were asked to give their advice to the government on a range of scenarios about extending the operational lifetimes of plants by four , 12 , 20 and 28 years . the study recommended that nuclear power plants should be kept open for between 12 and 20 years more than currently planned , the german news magazine focus reported saturday . a number of studies , many of which have come to different conclusions , have been recently issued by think-tanks and environmental organizations . after a tour of power plants around the country , german chancellor angela merkel said on friday that renewable energies should supply half of all energy needs by 2050 and that nuclear and coal power would continue until supplies could be met entirely by clean energy . evaluating outcomes for climate , economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor has completed four days of touring energy facilities the assessment was based on factors such as electricity prices , energy security and carbon emissions .
according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , experts believe that an extension would allow " the best outcomes for climate protection and the economy . " the coalition government of merkel , which aims to overhaul its energy policy by the end of september , received the study on friday .
the phasing out of german power plants had been planned by merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schroeder . according to a law passed in 2002 by the then-ruling spd-greens coalition , all of germany 's nuclear power plants were due to go offline by 2022 . merkel 's government has said it intends to extend that deadline .

serbian leader boris tadic reiterated , however , it would never recognize the breakaway state . the resolution , which is due to be debated next month at the un general assembly , calls for talks on outstanding issues between kosovo and serbia ; it also condemns the tiny state 's unilateral declaration of independence . serbian officials will travel to brussels in the coming days to " talk about possible changes to the draft resolution that would be acceptable to both serbia and big powers , " tadic was quoted as saying by the tanjug news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic albanians danced in the streets of kosovo upon independence a possible compromise " that will remain in line with serbia 's national interests but will also please big powers " will be discussed in brussels and washington soon , tadic added . serbia tabled the draft un resolution after the international court of justice issued a non-binding judgment in july that kosovo 's breakaway did not break international law . the issue poses major complications for serbia in its bid to eventually join the european union , which has warned the tadic government that its unremitting stance over kosovo could damage its accession to the 27-nation bloc . but tadic said compromise was not possible on kosovo 's independence . " serbia will never recognize kosovo .

half of the city 's historic railway station is being torn down so construction can begin . the german rail company , deutsche bahn , is paying only a fraction of the cost .
its chief , ruediger grube , issued an invitation late friday to the anti-project coalition to meet for roundtable talks next month . " we have to act like grown-ups , " he said .
at the same time gruebe affirmed that the project would go ahead , saying that legislation has been passed and contracts issued . " let 's sit down at the table and talk about things - especially the facts , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster swr , adding that pr surrounding the construction project had gone " very , very badly . " bahn wo n't delay construction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project opponents overran construction site this week gruebe added that the bahn would not submit to demands to halt construction during the discussions .
axel wieland , spokesperson for one of the groups organizing the demonstrations , said it would amount to little more than a diversionary tactic to hold talks while maintaining the construction schedule . " you ca n't have a nice conversation with us while the construction work keeps chugging along , " he told the afp news agency . protesters have picketed the building site at stuttgart 's main station for weeks .
only a small core of demonstrators was at the site saturday as work continued demolishing one wing of the station .
police counted 30,000 people friday at a protest vigil outside the state parliament in stuttgart .
the protest movement claimed 50,000 .
the protesters said they expect about 10,000 people to come to another demonstration on monday . the protesters have criticized that the costs for the project have grown from 7 billions euros to 11 billion .
proponents , however , have pointed out that work for the new train station has created 4,000 jobs , and shorter travel times that would help the environment as more people travel via rail instead of flying . only the station 's main section will remain when all the rail lines have been moved underground and the land above has been subdivided for buildings and a park . author : sean sinico -lrb- dpa / afp / ap -rrb- editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it will also make journey times faster , with the current terminus station being turned into a through-station , meaning trains will no longer have to reverse out . stuttgart police estimated the friday crowd at 10,000 . political fallout a survey published in the local stuttgarter nachrichten this week showed that 63 percent of the city 's residents are against the project , with just 26 percent in favor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the station 's north wing has already been demolished " these are n't radicals , it 's the people in the middle , " political scientist gero neugebauer told the reuters news agency .
" it should make the main political parties think twice .
they always say they want people to stand up and be counted but now they 're standing up and the leaders are turning a deaf ear . " the opposition to the stuttgart rail station project could have an impact on chancellor angela merkel 's government .
her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have ruled the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg since 1953 , but face an uphill struggle to hold onto power in the upcoming elections in march 2011 . " it will turn into a big problem for merkel if the cdu lose baden-wuerttemberg , " neugebauer said .
polls have shown the opposition center-left social democrats and greens ahead of the cdu and free democrats , who also form the coalition with merkel on the federal level in berlin . the project , part funded by the european union , aims to make stuttgart part of one of the longest high-speed lines in europe , linking paris , strasbourg , munich , vienna , bratislava and budapest . author : joanna impey -lrb- afp / ap / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

half of the city 's historic railway station is being torn down so construction can begin . the german rail company , deutsche bahn , is paying only a fraction of the cost .
its chief , ruediger grube , issued an invitation late friday to the anti-project coalition to meet for roundtable talks next month . " we have to act like grown-ups , " he said .
at the same time gruebe affirmed that the project would go ahead , saying that legislation has been passed and contracts issued . " let 's sit down at the table and talk about things - especially the facts , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster swr , adding that pr surrounding the construction project had gone " very , very badly . " bahn wo n't delay construction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project opponents overran construction site this week gruebe added that the bahn would not submit to demands to halt construction during the discussions .
axel wieland , spokesperson for one of the groups organizing the demonstrations , said it would amount to little more than a diversionary tactic to hold talks while maintaining the construction schedule . " you ca n't have a nice conversation with us while the construction work keeps chugging along , " he told the afp news agency . protesters have picketed the building site at stuttgart 's main station for weeks .
only a small core of demonstrators was at the site saturday as work continued demolishing one wing of the station .
police counted 30,000 people friday at a protest vigil outside the state parliament in stuttgart .
the protest movement claimed 50,000 .
the protesters said they expect about 10,000 people to come to another demonstration on monday . the protesters have criticized that the costs for the project have grown from 7 billions euros to 11 billion .
proponents , however , have pointed out that work for the new train station has created 4,000 jobs , and shorter travel times that would help the environment as more people travel via rail instead of flying . only the station 's main section will remain when all the rail lines have been moved underground and the land above has been subdivided for buildings and a park . author : sean sinico -lrb- dpa / afp / ap -rrb- editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it will also make journey times faster , with the current terminus station being turned into a through-station , meaning trains will no longer have to reverse out . stuttgart police estimated the friday crowd at 10,000 . political fallout a survey published in the local stuttgarter nachrichten this week showed that 63 percent of the city 's residents are against the project , with just 26 percent in favor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the station 's north wing has already been demolished " these are n't radicals , it 's the people in the middle , " political scientist gero neugebauer told the reuters news agency .
" it should make the main political parties think twice .
they always say they want people to stand up and be counted but now they 're standing up and the leaders are turning a deaf ear . " the opposition to the stuttgart rail station project could have an impact on chancellor angela merkel 's government .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kolat called on the government to act to remove sarrazin " i am calling upon the government to begin a procedure to remove thilo sarrazin from the board of the central bank , " kolat told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday , august 28 .
in his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , sarrazin claims that members of germany 's muslim community pose a danger to german society . sarrazin , a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and berlin 's former finance chief , was reported in june as saying that members of the turkish and arab community were making germany " more stupid .

merkel 's chief spokesman steffen seibert said on wednesday that many people would find the remarks " offensive " and " defamatory , " adding that the chancellor was concerned .
members of the spd have distanced themselves from sarrazin 's comments , while germany 's green and left parties have called for his removal from the central bank 's board .
a bundesbank spokesman said that sarrazin 's latest remarks were personal opinions , unconnected with his role on the board .

" they deserve respect , not malice . "
" all of those who are involved in society , those who encourage their children , who learn german , who work and pay taxes and those who , as entrepreneurs , provide jobs – all of them deserve respect . "
in june , 65-year-old sarrazin was reported as saying that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because immigrants were poorly educated .
' distorted image , half-truths ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin claims german society is being undermined by the muslim community maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , accused sarrazin of giving " a distorted image of integration in germany " that did not bear up to academic scrutiny .

" it is indisputable that , in education , there are currently a lot of immigrants with a lot of catching up to do .
it does not take sarrazin 's comments to establish that . "
in a lengthy interview with weekly newspaper die zeit , sarrazin defended himself against the charge he was encouraging racism .
" i am not a racist , " he told the newspaper .
" the book addresses cultural divisions , not ethnic ones . "
last year , sarrazin caused a storm by claiming that most of berlin 's arab and turkish immigrants had no useful function " apart from fruit and vegetable trading . "

half of the city 's historic railway station is being torn down so construction can begin . the german rail company , deutsche bahn , is paying only a fraction of the cost .
its chief , ruediger grube , issued an invitation late friday to the anti-project coalition to meet for roundtable talks next month . " we have to act like grown-ups , " he said .
at the same time gruebe affirmed that the project would go ahead , saying that legislation has been passed and contracts issued . " let 's sit down at the table and talk about things - especially the facts , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster swr , adding that pr surrounding the construction project had gone " very , very badly . " bahn wo n't delay construction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project opponents overran construction site this week gruebe added that the bahn would not submit to demands to halt construction during the discussions .
axel wieland , spokesperson for one of the groups organizing the demonstrations , said it would amount to little more than a diversionary tactic to hold talks while maintaining the construction schedule . " you ca n't have a nice conversation with us while the construction work keeps chugging along , " he told the afp news agency . protesters have picketed the building site at stuttgart 's main station for weeks .
only a small core of demonstrators was at the site saturday as work continued demolishing one wing of the station .
police counted 30,000 people friday at a protest vigil outside the state parliament in stuttgart .
the protest movement claimed 50,000 .
the protesters said they expect about 10,000 people to come to another demonstration on monday . the protesters have criticized that the costs for the project have grown from 7 billions euros to 11 billion .
proponents , however , have pointed out that work for the new train station has created 4,000 jobs , and shorter travel times that would help the environment as more people travel via rail instead of flying . only the station 's main section will remain when all the rail lines have been moved underground and the land above has been subdivided for buildings and a park . author : sean sinico -lrb- dpa / afp / ap -rrb- editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kolat called on the government to act to remove sarrazin " i am calling upon the government to begin a procedure to remove thilo sarrazin from the board of the central bank , " kolat told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday , august 28 .
in his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , sarrazin claims that members of germany 's muslim community pose a danger to german society . sarrazin , a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and berlin 's former finance chief , was reported in june as saying that members of the turkish and arab community were making germany " more stupid . "
with his book , kolat said , sarrazin had overstepped a boundary .
" it is the climax of a new intellectual racism and it damages germany 's reputation abroad , " kolat said .
high birth-rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says that his book is addressing cultural division in a serialization of the forthcoming book in the german popular daily newspaper bild , sarrazin said that germany 's muslim community had profited from social welfare payments far more than they contributed , and that higher birth-rates among immigrants could lead to the muslim population overtaking the " indigenous " one in terms of numbers .
merkel 's chief spokesman steffen seibert said on wednesday that many people would find the remarks " offensive " and " defamatory , " adding that the chancellor was concerned .
members of the spd have distanced themselves from sarrazin 's comments , while germany 's green and left parties have called for his removal from the central bank 's board .
a bundesbank spokesman said that sarrazin 's latest remarks were personal opinions , unconnected with his role on the board .
blanket generalizations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first female muslim minister said the comments lacked respect lower saxony 's minister of social affairs , ayguel oezkan , germany 's first-ever female muslim minister , accused sarrazin of doing damage to the muslim community with blanket generalizations .
" there are a vast number of hard-working immigrants , " she told the weekly german newspaper bild am sonntag ahead of its publication on sunday .
" they deserve respect , not malice . "
" all of those who are involved in society , those who encourage their children , who learn german , who work and pay taxes and those who , as entrepreneurs , provide jobs – all of them deserve respect . "
in june , 65-year-old sarrazin was reported as saying that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because immigrants were poorly educated .
' distorted image , half-truths ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin claims german society is being undermined by the muslim community maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , accused sarrazin of giving " a distorted image of integration in germany " that did not bear up to academic scrutiny .
" in his comments , he states only half truths , " she told bild am sonntag .
" it is indisputable that , in education , there are currently a lot of immigrants with a lot of catching up to do .
it does not take sarrazin 's comments to establish that . "
in a lengthy interview with weekly newspaper die zeit , sarrazin defended himself against the charge he was encouraging racism .
" i am not a racist , " he told the newspaper .
" the book addresses cultural divisions , not ethnic ones . "
last year , sarrazin caused a storm by claiming that most of berlin 's arab and turkish immigrants had no useful function " apart from fruit and vegetable trading . "
as a result , the central bank stripped sarrazin of some of his duties .

half of the city 's historic railway station is being torn down so construction can begin . the german rail company , deutsche bahn , is paying only a fraction of the cost .
its chief , ruediger grube , issued an invitation late friday to the anti-project coalition to meet for roundtable talks next month . " we have to act like grown-ups , " he said .
at the same time gruebe affirmed that the project would go ahead , saying that legislation has been passed and contracts issued . " let 's sit down at the table and talk about things - especially the facts , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster swr , adding that pr surrounding the construction project had gone " very , very badly . " bahn wo n't delay construction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project opponents overran construction site this week gruebe added that the bahn would not submit to demands to halt construction during the discussions .
axel wieland , spokesperson for one of the groups organizing the demonstrations , said it would amount to little more than a diversionary tactic to hold talks while maintaining the construction schedule . " you ca n't have a nice conversation with us while the construction work keeps chugging along , " he told the afp news agency . protesters have picketed the building site at stuttgart 's main station for weeks .
only a small core of demonstrators was at the site saturday as work continued demolishing one wing of the station .
police counted 30,000 people friday at a protest vigil outside the state parliament in stuttgart .
the protest movement claimed 50,000 .
the protesters said they expect about 10,000 people to come to another demonstration on monday . the protesters have criticized that the costs for the project have grown from 7 billions euros to 11 billion .
proponents , however , have pointed out that work for the new train station has created 4,000 jobs , and shorter travel times that would help the environment as more people travel via rail instead of flying . only the station 's main section will remain when all the rail lines have been moved underground and the land above has been subdivided for buildings and a park . author : sean sinico -lrb- dpa / afp / ap -rrb- editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it will also make journey times faster , with the current terminus station being turned into a through-station , meaning trains will no longer have to reverse out . stuttgart police estimated the friday crowd at 10,000 . political fallout a survey published in the local stuttgarter nachrichten this week showed that 63 percent of the city 's residents are against the project , with just 26 percent in favor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the station 's north wing has already been demolished " these are n't radicals , it 's the people in the middle , " political scientist gero neugebauer told the reuters news agency .
" it should make the main political parties think twice .
they always say they want people to stand up and be counted but now they 're standing up and the leaders are turning a deaf ear . " the opposition to the stuttgart rail station project could have an impact on chancellor angela merkel 's government .
her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have ruled the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg since 1953 , but face an uphill struggle to hold onto power in the upcoming elections in march 2011 . " it will turn into a big problem for merkel if the cdu lose baden-wuerttemberg , " neugebauer said .
polls have shown the opposition center-left social democrats and greens ahead of the cdu and free democrats , who also form the coalition with merkel on the federal level in berlin . the project , part funded by the european union , aims to make stuttgart part of one of the longest high-speed lines in europe , linking paris , strasbourg , munich , vienna , bratislava and budapest . author : joanna impey -lrb- afp / ap / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he shared his thoughts with deutsche welle on the character of siegfried and performing at the celebrated festival . canadian lance ryan , who resides in karlsruhe , germany , first performed in germany in 2005 as " otello " at the staedtische buehnen muenster .
he 's sung at opera houses around the world , including at the vienna state opera and the frankfurt opera house .
a german opera magazine called him " sensational " in his role as siegfried in richard wagner 's opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung . " the 2010 bayreuth festival draws to a close on saturday , august 28 . deutsche welle : what path led to bayreuth for you ? lance ryan : i think it began with debuting the role of siegfried and initially having some success ; the word started to spread .
from what i understand , -lsb- bayreuth festival co-director -rsb- eva wagner-pasquier first heard me in stuttgart in " the flying dutchman , " and then she came to hear me once again in mulhouse when we were doing " siegfried . "
she really liked what she heard , and , at that point , a dialogue started to open between her and my agent . i think in september she first said they thought they needed a new siegfried for this coming summer .
it was short notice in operatic terms - 11 months - but i had the summer free , and i thought , " why not ? "
at that point , i also felt i owed something to frau wagner for spreading the good word about me and helping to propel me . on stage , you appear very natural in the role of siegfried .
do you feel natural despite the rather artificial situation of performing and singing at this energy level ? i think you have to find the enthusiasm , the energy and the youthfulness in siegfried .
there are many different aspects to the character , and that 's one of the reasons he 's fascinating to play .
you think back to being around 17 or 18 - the age siegfried is supposed to be - in that rebellious phase where you 're growing , and you want to get out and discover , but you really have no idea what you 're getting into .
that 's exactly what siegfried is .
once you kind of identify with that , everything else comes with it . it 's strange with wagner - it never strikes you right away what a great musician he is because the work is just so complex .
it 's so rich and dense that you have to sift through much material in order to find how he makes it work in such a genius way .
once you 've recognized all that , then you find the road , and it carries you .
in that way , it eventually does come naturally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryan said the bayreuth stage opens up possibilities unavailable elsewhere there 's certainly a heroic aspect to the music , and wagner said siegfried was his ultimate hero even though the character is adolescent and foolish .
why would siegfried be considered a hero ? it 's a great comparison when you take siegfried and siegmund , siegfried 's father .
siegmund had his father there to guide and teach him how to hunt and fight and deal with certain situations , but siegfried did n't have that .
he only had mime , this dwarf who never really loved him .
so i think one of the great tragedies in the work is that siegfried is a kind of dysfunctional character .
you have this boy with great potential but who is just born in tragic circumstances . i tend to think that wagner could identify that with his own history .
he recognized in himself what a great musician , dramatist and talent he was .
but early in his career , that was never recognized .
i think this inability to fulfill oneself in one 's youth is something he identified with , so maybe that 's why he feels siegfried was his greatest hero . i think that 's also one of the great lessons of the ring - to show what love really means and to show what can go wrong if it 's not nurtured between people . i imagine there is now a lot of demand for you to sing in new productions .
what priorities do you have musically ?
yes , there 's a lot of demand , and i have quite a few productions in view within the next five or six years .
but at the same time , i always want to keep a more lyrical side to the roles .
in the market , once you have a stamp or an identity , that 's what the theaters want because they want to say , " we have this singer in this role . "
it 's a marketing thing , and that 's just the way it is in modern society .
there 's a commercial aspect to it all now , in contrast to 100 years ago when there was more patronage . but i try to keep a balance for my vocal health and for artistic reasons .
i look for variety - something new and something lighter for my voice .
siegfried is good for my voice because the part is n't so deep .
its register still lies quite high , unlike tristan or parsifal .
with siegfried , you can keep the very tenor aspects , and when you do , i think the more heroic qualities come out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva wagner-pasquier -lrb- right -rrb- noticed ryan 's talent and helped recruit him for bayreuth how would you describe your first experience performing on the wagner stage ? it 's great - an amazing theater with an amazing acoustic .
i think the biggest difference for me was the way the orchestra pit is divided .
as a singer on stage , you hear the violins very clearly , but you do n't hear the horns and woodwinds as well as you normally would .
so , you have a different sound from the orchestra as an artist on stage , and you have to take note of that . other than that , the acoustic here gives you great confidence that you can do more vocally and artistically with color because you know the audience can almost always hear you .
like conductor christian thielemann has said , " you do n't have to sing so loud , we will adjust . "
that 's excellent to hear a conductor say that .
then you know you can play vocally - with lightness and color - and you do n't have to think " can the audience hear me ? " with this conductor and this stage , you feel that you can do things that you might not be able to do anywhere else .

i think the biggest difference for me was the way the orchestra pit is divided .
as a singer on stage , you hear the violins very clearly , but you do n't hear the horns and woodwinds as well as you normally would .
so , you have a different sound from the orchestra as an artist on stage , and you have to take note of that . other than that , the acoustic here gives you great confidence that you can do more vocally and artistically with color because you know the audience can almost always hear you .
like conductor christian thielemann has said , " you do n't have to sing so loud , we will adjust . "
that 's excellent to hear a conductor say that .
then you know you can play vocally - with lightness and color - and you do n't have to think " can the audience hear me ? " with this conductor and this stage , you feel that you can do things that you might not be able to do anywhere else .

he shared his thoughts with deutsche welle on the character of siegfried and performing at the celebrated festival . canadian lance ryan , who resides in karlsruhe , germany , first performed in germany in 2005 as " otello " at the staedtische buehnen muenster .
he 's sung at opera houses around the world , including at the vienna state opera and the frankfurt opera house .
a german opera magazine called him " sensational " in his role as siegfried in richard wagner 's opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung . " the 2010 bayreuth festival draws to a close on saturday , august 28 . deutsche welle : what path led to bayreuth for you ? lance ryan : i think it began with debuting the role of siegfried and initially having some success ; the word started to spread .
from what i understand , -lsb- bayreuth festival co-director -rsb- eva wagner-pasquier first heard me in stuttgart in " the flying dutchman , " and then she came to hear me once again in mulhouse when we were doing " siegfried . "
she really liked what she heard , and , at that point , a dialogue started to open between her and my agent . i think in september she first said they thought they needed a new siegfried for this coming summer .
it was short notice in operatic terms - 11 months - but i had the summer free , and i thought , " why not ? "
at that point , i also felt i owed something to frau wagner for spreading the good word about me and helping to propel me . on stage , you appear very natural in the role of siegfried .
do you feel natural despite the rather artificial situation of performing and singing at this energy level ? i think you have to find the enthusiasm , the energy and the youthfulness in siegfried .
there are many different aspects to the character , and that 's one of the reasons he 's fascinating to play .
you think back to being around 17 or 18 - the age siegfried is supposed to be - in that rebellious phase where you 're growing , and you want to get out and discover , but you really have no idea what you 're getting into .
that 's exactly what siegfried is .
once you kind of identify with that , everything else comes with it . it 's strange with wagner - it never strikes you right away what a great musician he is because the work is just so complex .
it 's so rich and dense that you have to sift through much material in order to find how he makes it work in such a genius way .
once you 've recognized all that , then you find the road , and it carries you .
in that way , it eventually does come naturally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryan said the bayreuth stage opens up possibilities unavailable elsewhere there 's certainly a heroic aspect to the music , and wagner said siegfried was his ultimate hero even though the character is adolescent and foolish .
why would siegfried be considered a hero ? it 's a great comparison when you take siegfried and siegmund , siegfried 's father .
siegmund had his father there to guide and teach him how to hunt and fight and deal with certain situations , but siegfried did n't have that .
he only had mime , this dwarf who never really loved him .
so i think one of the great tragedies in the work is that siegfried is a kind of dysfunctional character .
you have this boy with great potential but who is just born in tragic circumstances . i tend to think that wagner could identify that with his own history .
he recognized in himself what a great musician , dramatist and talent he was .
but early in his career , that was never recognized .
i think this inability to fulfill oneself in one 's youth is something he identified with , so maybe that 's why he feels siegfried was his greatest hero . i think that 's also one of the great lessons of the ring - to show what love really means and to show what can go wrong if it 's not nurtured between people . i imagine there is now a lot of demand for you to sing in new productions .
what priorities do you have musically ?
yes , there 's a lot of demand , and i have quite a few productions in view within the next five or six years .
but at the same time , i always want to keep a more lyrical side to the roles .
in the market , once you have a stamp or an identity , that 's what the theaters want because they want to say , " we have this singer in this role . "
it 's a marketing thing , and that 's just the way it is in modern society .
there 's a commercial aspect to it all now , in contrast to 100 years ago when there was more patronage . but i try to keep a balance for my vocal health and for artistic reasons .
i look for variety - something new and something lighter for my voice .
siegfried is good for my voice because the part is n't so deep .
its register still lies quite high , unlike tristan or parsifal .
with siegfried , you can keep the very tenor aspects , and when you do , i think the more heroic qualities come out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva wagner-pasquier -lrb- right -rrb- noticed ryan 's talent and helped recruit him for bayreuth how would you describe your first experience performing on the wagner stage ? it 's great - an amazing theater with an amazing acoustic .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kolat called on the government to act to remove sarrazin " i am calling upon the government to begin a procedure to remove thilo sarrazin from the board of the central bank , " kolat told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday , august 28 .
in his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , sarrazin claims that members of germany 's muslim community pose a danger to german society . sarrazin , a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and berlin 's former finance chief , was reported in june as saying that members of the turkish and arab community were making germany " more stupid . "
with his book , kolat said , sarrazin had overstepped a boundary .
" it is the climax of a new intellectual racism and it damages germany 's reputation abroad , " kolat said .
high birth-rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says that his book is addressing cultural division in a serialization of the forthcoming book in the german popular daily newspaper bild , sarrazin said that germany 's muslim community had profited from social welfare payments far more than they contributed , and that higher birth-rates among immigrants could lead to the muslim population overtaking the " indigenous " one in terms of numbers .
merkel 's chief spokesman steffen seibert said on wednesday that many people would find the remarks " offensive " and " defamatory , " adding that the chancellor was concerned .
members of the spd have distanced themselves from sarrazin 's comments , while germany 's green and left parties have called for his removal from the central bank 's board .
a bundesbank spokesman said that sarrazin 's latest remarks were personal opinions , unconnected with his role on the board .
blanket generalizations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first female muslim minister said the comments lacked respect lower saxony 's minister of social affairs , ayguel oezkan , germany 's first-ever female muslim minister , accused sarrazin of doing damage to the muslim community with blanket generalizations .
" there are a vast number of hard-working immigrants , " she told the weekly german newspaper bild am sonntag ahead of its publication on sunday .
" they deserve respect , not malice . "
" all of those who are involved in society , those who encourage their children , who learn german , who work and pay taxes and those who , as entrepreneurs , provide jobs – all of them deserve respect . "
in june , 65-year-old sarrazin was reported as saying that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because immigrants were poorly educated .
' distorted image , half-truths ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin claims german society is being undermined by the muslim community maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , accused sarrazin of giving " a distorted image of integration in germany " that did not bear up to academic scrutiny .
" in his comments , he states only half truths , " she told bild am sonntag .
" it is indisputable that , in education , there are currently a lot of immigrants with a lot of catching up to do .
it does not take sarrazin 's comments to establish that . "
in a lengthy interview with weekly newspaper die zeit , sarrazin defended himself against the charge he was encouraging racism .
" i am not a racist , " he told the newspaper .
" the book addresses cultural divisions , not ethnic ones . "
last year , sarrazin caused a storm by claiming that most of berlin 's arab and turkish immigrants had no useful function " apart from fruit and vegetable trading . "
as a result , the central bank stripped sarrazin of some of his duties .

" the event 's organizer asked for police assistance because his security concept fell apart , " police inspector dieter wehe told reporters saturday .
" he had agreed to close the entrance gates .
that did not happen . " according to german mass-market daily bild , the videos are scheduled to be released early next week . blame game police and duisburg officials lined up against the love parade organizers in the days and weeks following the stampede in an effort to deflect blame for the incident . despite being at the center of the storm , schaller said " moral responsibility " for the stampede must eventually be assigned . " i was the organizer and these people would not have died if this event had not taken place , " he said .
" who is actually to blame must be established by the legal system .
obviously i will face up to responsibility . " author : darren mara -lrb- dpa / afp -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kolat called on the government to act to remove sarrazin " i am calling upon the government to begin a procedure to remove thilo sarrazin from the board of the central bank , " kolat told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday , august 28 .
in his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , sarrazin claims that members of germany 's muslim community pose a danger to german society . sarrazin , a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and berlin 's former finance chief , was reported in june as saying that members of the turkish and arab community were making germany " more stupid . "
with his book , kolat said , sarrazin had overstepped a boundary .
" it is the climax of a new intellectual racism and it damages germany 's reputation abroad , " kolat said .
high birth-rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says that his book is addressing cultural division in a serialization of the forthcoming book in the german popular daily newspaper bild , sarrazin said that germany 's muslim community had profited from social welfare payments far more than they contributed , and that higher birth-rates among immigrants could lead to the muslim population overtaking the " indigenous " one in terms of numbers .
merkel 's chief spokesman steffen seibert said on wednesday that many people would find the remarks " offensive " and " defamatory , " adding that the chancellor was concerned .
members of the spd have distanced themselves from sarrazin 's comments , while germany 's green and left parties have called for his removal from the central bank 's board .
a bundesbank spokesman said that sarrazin 's latest remarks were personal opinions , unconnected with his role on the board .
blanket generalizations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first female muslim minister said the comments lacked respect lower saxony 's minister of social affairs , ayguel oezkan , germany 's first-ever female muslim minister , accused sarrazin of doing damage to the muslim community with blanket generalizations .
" there are a vast number of hard-working immigrants , " she told the weekly german newspaper bild am sonntag ahead of its publication on sunday .
" they deserve respect , not malice . "
" all of those who are involved in society , those who encourage their children , who learn german , who work and pay taxes and those who , as entrepreneurs , provide jobs – all of them deserve respect . "
in june , 65-year-old sarrazin was reported as saying that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because immigrants were poorly educated .
' distorted image , half-truths ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin claims german society is being undermined by the muslim community maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , accused sarrazin of giving " a distorted image of integration in germany " that did not bear up to academic scrutiny .
" in his comments , he states only half truths , " she told bild am sonntag .
" it is indisputable that , in education , there are currently a lot of immigrants with a lot of catching up to do .
it does not take sarrazin 's comments to establish that . "
in a lengthy interview with weekly newspaper die zeit , sarrazin defended himself against the charge he was encouraging racism .
" i am not a racist , " he told the newspaper .
" the book addresses cultural divisions , not ethnic ones . "
last year , sarrazin caused a storm by claiming that most of berlin 's arab and turkish immigrants had no useful function " apart from fruit and vegetable trading . "
as a result , the central bank stripped sarrazin of some of his duties .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kolat called on the government to act to remove sarrazin " i am calling upon the government to begin a procedure to remove thilo sarrazin from the board of the central bank , " kolat told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday , august 28 .
in his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , sarrazin claims that members of germany 's muslim community pose a danger to german society . sarrazin , a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and berlin 's former finance chief , was reported in june as saying that members of the turkish and arab community were making germany " more stupid . "
with his book , kolat said , sarrazin had overstepped a boundary .
" it is the climax of a new intellectual racism and it damages germany 's reputation abroad , " kolat said .
high birth-rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says that his book is addressing cultural division in a serialization of the forthcoming book in the german popular daily newspaper bild , sarrazin said that germany 's muslim community had profited from social welfare payments far more than they contributed , and that higher birth-rates among immigrants could lead to the muslim population overtaking the " indigenous " one in terms of numbers .
merkel 's chief spokesman steffen seibert said on wednesday that many people would find the remarks " offensive " and " defamatory , " adding that the chancellor was concerned .
members of the spd have distanced themselves from sarrazin 's comments , while germany 's green and left parties have called for his removal from the central bank 's board .
a bundesbank spokesman said that sarrazin 's latest remarks were personal opinions , unconnected with his role on the board .
blanket generalizations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first female muslim minister said the comments lacked respect lower saxony 's minister of social affairs , ayguel oezkan , germany 's first-ever female muslim minister , accused sarrazin of doing damage to the muslim community with blanket generalizations .
" there are a vast number of hard-working immigrants , " she told the weekly german newspaper bild am sonntag ahead of its publication on sunday .
" they deserve respect , not malice . "
" all of those who are involved in society , those who encourage their children , who learn german , who work and pay taxes and those who , as entrepreneurs , provide jobs – all of them deserve respect . "
in june , 65-year-old sarrazin was reported as saying that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because immigrants were poorly educated .
' distorted image , half-truths ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin claims german society is being undermined by the muslim community maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , accused sarrazin of giving " a distorted image of integration in germany " that did not bear up to academic scrutiny .
" in his comments , he states only half truths , " she told bild am sonntag .
" it is indisputable that , in education , there are currently a lot of immigrants with a lot of catching up to do .
it does not take sarrazin 's comments to establish that . "
in a lengthy interview with weekly newspaper die zeit , sarrazin defended himself against the charge he was encouraging racism .
" i am not a racist , " he told the newspaper .
" the book addresses cultural divisions , not ethnic ones . "
last year , sarrazin caused a storm by claiming that most of berlin 's arab and turkish immigrants had no useful function " apart from fruit and vegetable trading . "
as a result , the central bank stripped sarrazin of some of his duties .

it will also make journey times faster , with the current terminus station being turned into a through-station , meaning trains will no longer have to reverse out . stuttgart police estimated the friday crowd at 10,000 . political fallout a survey published in the local stuttgarter nachrichten this week showed that 63 percent of the city 's residents are against the project , with just 26 percent in favor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the station 's north wing has already been demolished " these are n't radicals , it 's the people in the middle , " political scientist gero neugebauer told the reuters news agency .
" it should make the main political parties think twice .
they always say they want people to stand up and be counted but now they 're standing up and the leaders are turning a deaf ear . " the opposition to the stuttgart rail station project could have an impact on chancellor angela merkel 's government .
her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have ruled the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg since 1953 , but face an uphill struggle to hold onto power in the upcoming elections in march 2011 . " it will turn into a big problem for merkel if the cdu lose baden-wuerttemberg , " neugebauer said .
polls have shown the opposition center-left social democrats and greens ahead of the cdu and free democrats , who also form the coalition with merkel on the federal level in berlin . the project , part funded by the european union , aims to make stuttgart part of one of the longest high-speed lines in europe , linking paris , strasbourg , munich , vienna , bratislava and budapest . author : joanna impey -lrb- afp / ap / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government faces resistance if it presses ahead . a study commissioned by the german government has recommended an extension of up to 20 years to the life of nuclear power plants , according to reports . experts from germany 's institute of energy economics at the university of cologne -lrb- ewi -rrb- were asked to give their advice to the government on a range of scenarios about extending the operational lifetimes of plants by four , 12 , 20 and 28 years . the study recommended that nuclear power plants should be kept open for between 12 and 20 years more than currently planned , the german news magazine focus reported saturday . a number of studies , many of which have come to different conclusions , have been recently issued by think-tanks and environmental organizations . after a tour of power plants around the country , german chancellor angela merkel said on friday that renewable energies should supply half of all energy needs by 2050 and that nuclear and coal power would continue until supplies could be met entirely by clean energy . evaluating outcomes for climate , economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor has completed four days of touring energy facilities the assessment was based on factors such as electricity prices , energy security and carbon emissions .
according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , experts believe that an extension would allow " the best outcomes for climate protection and the economy . " the coalition government of merkel , which aims to overhaul its energy policy by the end of september , received the study on friday .
the phasing out of german power plants had been planned by merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schroeder . according to a law passed in 2002 by the then-ruling spd-greens coalition , all of germany 's nuclear power plants were due to go offline by 2022 . merkel 's government has said it intends to extend that deadline .
until recently , it had been thought that any legal change would need to be approved by the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , which represents the country 's 16 states . bypassing the upper house ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state ministers plan to take a fight against any extension to the constitutional court however , after the may election in north rhine-westphalia , the center-right coalition lost its majority in the upper chamber and plans to bypass the bundesrat entirely were hinted at - infuriating opposition parties . the government now faces resistance to its plans with nine out of 16 german states opposed to them , including hamburg , thuringia and saarland which are led by merkel 's own christian democrats . ministers from both north rhine-westphalia and rhineland-palatinate have said that they will press for a judicial review in germany 's constitutional court , if the government goes ahead without bundesrat approval . a poll released by zdf television on friday showed that 56 percent of those surveyed were opposed to an extension while 38 percent supported it . author : richard connor -lrb- afp / dpa / ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

half of the city 's historic railway station is being torn down so construction can begin . the german rail company , deutsche bahn , is paying only a fraction of the cost .
its chief , ruediger grube , issued an invitation late friday to the anti-project coalition to meet for roundtable talks next month . " we have to act like grown-ups , " he said .
at the same time gruebe affirmed that the project would go ahead , saying that legislation has been passed and contracts issued .

axel wieland , spokesperson for one of the groups organizing the demonstrations , said it would amount to little more than a diversionary tactic to hold talks while maintaining the construction schedule . " you ca n't have a nice conversation with us while the construction work keeps chugging along , " he told the afp news agency . protesters have picketed the building site at stuttgart 's main station for weeks .
only a small core of demonstrators was at the site saturday as work continued demolishing one wing of the station .
police counted 30,000 people friday at a protest vigil outside the state parliament in stuttgart .
the protest movement claimed 50,000 .
the protesters said they expect about 10,000 people to come to another demonstration on monday . the protesters have criticized that the costs for the project have grown from 7 billions euros to 11 billion .
proponents , however , have pointed out that work for the new train station has created 4,000 jobs , and shorter travel times that would help the environment as more people travel via rail instead of flying . only the station 's main section will remain when all the rail lines have been moved underground and the land above has been subdivided for buildings and a park . author : sean sinico -lrb- dpa / afp / ap -rrb- editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kolat called on the government to act to remove sarrazin " i am calling upon the government to begin a procedure to remove thilo sarrazin from the board of the central bank , " kolat told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday , august 28 .
in his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , sarrazin claims that members of germany 's muslim community pose a danger to german society . sarrazin , a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and berlin 's former finance chief , was reported in june as saying that members of the turkish and arab community were making germany " more stupid . "
with his book , kolat said , sarrazin had overstepped a boundary .
" it is the climax of a new intellectual racism and it damages germany 's reputation abroad , " kolat said .
high birth-rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says that his book is addressing cultural division in a serialization of the forthcoming book in the german popular daily newspaper bild , sarrazin said that germany 's muslim community had profited from social welfare payments far more than they contributed , and that higher birth-rates among immigrants could lead to the muslim population overtaking the " indigenous " one in terms of numbers .
merkel 's chief spokesman steffen seibert said on wednesday that many people would find the remarks " offensive " and " defamatory , " adding that the chancellor was concerned .
members of the spd have distanced themselves from sarrazin 's comments , while germany 's green and left parties have called for his removal from the central bank 's board .
a bundesbank spokesman said that sarrazin 's latest remarks were personal opinions , unconnected with his role on the board .
blanket generalizations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first female muslim minister said the comments lacked respect lower saxony 's minister of social affairs , ayguel oezkan , germany 's first-ever female muslim minister , accused sarrazin of doing damage to the muslim community with blanket generalizations .
" there are a vast number of hard-working immigrants , " she told the weekly german newspaper bild am sonntag ahead of its publication on sunday .
" they deserve respect , not malice . "
" all of those who are involved in society , those who encourage their children , who learn german , who work and pay taxes and those who , as entrepreneurs , provide jobs – all of them deserve respect . "
in june , 65-year-old sarrazin was reported as saying that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because immigrants were poorly educated .
' distorted image , half-truths ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin claims german society is being undermined by the muslim community maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , accused sarrazin of giving " a distorted image of integration in germany " that did not bear up to academic scrutiny .
" in his comments , he states only half truths , " she told bild am sonntag .
" it is indisputable that , in education , there are currently a lot of immigrants with a lot of catching up to do .
it does not take sarrazin 's comments to establish that . "
in a lengthy interview with weekly newspaper die zeit , sarrazin defended himself against the charge he was encouraging racism .
" i am not a racist , " he told the newspaper .
" the book addresses cultural divisions , not ethnic ones . "
last year , sarrazin caused a storm by claiming that most of berlin 's arab and turkish immigrants had no useful function " apart from fruit and vegetable trading . "
as a result , the central bank stripped sarrazin of some of his duties .

he shared his thoughts with deutsche welle on the character of siegfried and performing at the celebrated festival . canadian lance ryan , who resides in karlsruhe , germany , first performed in germany in 2005 as " otello " at the staedtische buehnen muenster .
he 's sung at opera houses around the world , including at the vienna state opera and the frankfurt opera house .
a german opera magazine called him " sensational " in his role as siegfried in richard wagner 's opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung . " the 2010 bayreuth festival draws to a close on saturday , august 28 . deutsche welle : what path led to bayreuth for you ? lance ryan : i think it began with debuting the role of siegfried and initially having some success ; the word started to spread .
from what i understand , -lsb- bayreuth festival co-director -rsb- eva wagner-pasquier first heard me in stuttgart in " the flying dutchman , " and then she came to hear me once again in mulhouse when we were doing " siegfried . "
she really liked what she heard , and , at that point , a dialogue started to open between her and my agent . i think in september she first said they thought they needed a new siegfried for this coming summer .
it was short notice in operatic terms - 11 months - but i had the summer free , and i thought , " why not ? "
at that point , i also felt i owed something to frau wagner for spreading the good word about me and helping to propel me . on stage , you appear very natural in the role of siegfried .
do you feel natural despite the rather artificial situation of performing and singing at this energy level ? i think you have to find the enthusiasm , the energy and the youthfulness in siegfried .
there are many different aspects to the character , and that 's one of the reasons he 's fascinating to play .
you think back to being around 17 or 18 - the age siegfried is supposed to be - in that rebellious phase where you 're growing , and you want to get out and discover , but you really have no idea what you 're getting into .
that 's exactly what siegfried is .
once you kind of identify with that , everything else comes with it . it 's strange with wagner - it never strikes you right away what a great musician he is because the work is just so complex .
it 's so rich and dense that you have to sift through much material in order to find how he makes it work in such a genius way .
once you 've recognized all that , then you find the road , and it carries you .
in that way , it eventually does come naturally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryan said the bayreuth stage opens up possibilities unavailable elsewhere there 's certainly a heroic aspect to the music , and wagner said siegfried was his ultimate hero even though the character is adolescent and foolish .
why would siegfried be considered a hero ? it 's a great comparison when you take siegfried and siegmund , siegfried 's father .
siegmund had his father there to guide and teach him how to hunt and fight and deal with certain situations , but siegfried did n't have that .
he only had mime , this dwarf who never really loved him .
so i think one of the great tragedies in the work is that siegfried is a kind of dysfunctional character .
you have this boy with great potential but who is just born in tragic circumstances . i tend to think that wagner could identify that with his own history .
he recognized in himself what a great musician , dramatist and talent he was .
but early in his career , that was never recognized .
i think this inability to fulfill oneself in one 's youth is something he identified with , so maybe that 's why he feels siegfried was his greatest hero . i think that 's also one of the great lessons of the ring - to show what love really means and to show what can go wrong if it 's not nurtured between people . i imagine there is now a lot of demand for you to sing in new productions .
what priorities do you have musically ?
yes , there 's a lot of demand , and i have quite a few productions in view within the next five or six years .
but at the same time , i always want to keep a more lyrical side to the roles .
in the market , once you have a stamp or an identity , that 's what the theaters want because they want to say , " we have this singer in this role . "
it 's a marketing thing , and that 's just the way it is in modern society .
there 's a commercial aspect to it all now , in contrast to 100 years ago when there was more patronage . but i try to keep a balance for my vocal health and for artistic reasons .
i look for variety - something new and something lighter for my voice .
siegfried is good for my voice because the part is n't so deep .
its register still lies quite high , unlike tristan or parsifal .
with siegfried , you can keep the very tenor aspects , and when you do , i think the more heroic qualities come out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva wagner-pasquier -lrb- right -rrb- noticed ryan 's talent and helped recruit him for bayreuth how would you describe your first experience performing on the wagner stage ? it 's great - an amazing theater with an amazing acoustic .
i think the biggest difference for me was the way the orchestra pit is divided .
as a singer on stage , you hear the violins very clearly , but you do n't hear the horns and woodwinds as well as you normally would .
so , you have a different sound from the orchestra as an artist on stage , and you have to take note of that . other than that , the acoustic here gives you great confidence that you can do more vocally and artistically with color because you know the audience can almost always hear you .
like conductor christian thielemann has said , " you do n't have to sing so loud , we will adjust . "
that 's excellent to hear a conductor say that .
then you know you can play vocally - with lightness and color - and you do n't have to think " can the audience hear me ? " with this conductor and this stage , you feel that you can do things that you might not be able to do anywhere else .

you have this boy with great potential but who is just born in tragic circumstances . i tend to think that wagner could identify that with his own history .
he recognized in himself what a great musician , dramatist and talent he was .
but early in his career , that was never recognized .
i think this inability to fulfill oneself in one 's youth is something he identified with , so maybe that 's why he feels siegfried was his greatest hero . i think that 's also one of the great lessons of the ring - to show what love really means and to show what can go wrong if it 's not nurtured between people . i imagine there is now a lot of demand for you to sing in new productions .
what priorities do you have musically ?
yes , there 's a lot of demand , and i have quite a few productions in view within the next five or six years .
but at the same time , i always want to keep a more lyrical side to the roles .
in the market , once you have a stamp or an identity , that 's what the theaters want because they want to say , " we have this singer in this role . "
it 's a marketing thing , and that 's just the way it is in modern society .
there 's a commercial aspect to it all now , in contrast to 100 years ago when there was more patronage . but i try to keep a balance for my vocal health and for artistic reasons .
i look for variety - something new and something lighter for my voice .
siegfried is good for my voice because the part is n't so deep .
its register still lies quite high , unlike tristan or parsifal .
with siegfried , you can keep the very tenor aspects , and when you do , i think the more heroic qualities come out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva wagner-pasquier -lrb- right -rrb- noticed ryan 's talent and helped recruit him for bayreuth how would you describe your first experience performing on the wagner stage ? it 's great - an amazing theater with an amazing acoustic .
i think the biggest difference for me was the way the orchestra pit is divided .
as a singer on stage , you hear the violins very clearly , but you do n't hear the horns and woodwinds as well as you normally would .
so , you have a different sound from the orchestra as an artist on stage , and you have to take note of that . other than that , the acoustic here gives you great confidence that you can do more vocally and artistically with color because you know the audience can almost always hear you .
like conductor christian thielemann has said , " you do n't have to sing so loud , we will adjust . "
that 's excellent to hear a conductor say that .
then you know you can play vocally - with lightness and color - and you do n't have to think " can the audience hear me ? " with this conductor and this stage , you feel that you can do things that you might not be able to do anywhere else .

he shared his thoughts with deutsche welle on the character of siegfried and performing at the celebrated festival . canadian lance ryan , who resides in karlsruhe , germany , first performed in germany in 2005 as " otello " at the staedtische buehnen muenster .
he 's sung at opera houses around the world , including at the vienna state opera and the frankfurt opera house .
a german opera magazine called him " sensational " in his role as siegfried in richard wagner 's opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung . " the 2010 bayreuth festival draws to a close on saturday , august 28 . deutsche welle : what path led to bayreuth for you ? lance ryan : i think it began with debuting the role of siegfried and initially having some success ; the word started to spread .
from what i understand , -lsb- bayreuth festival co-director -rsb- eva wagner-pasquier first heard me in stuttgart in " the flying dutchman , " and then she came to hear me once again in mulhouse when we were doing " siegfried . "
she really liked what she heard , and , at that point , a dialogue started to open between her and my agent . i think in september she first said they thought they needed a new siegfried for this coming summer .
it was short notice in operatic terms - 11 months - but i had the summer free , and i thought , " why not ? "
at that point , i also felt i owed something to frau wagner for spreading the good word about me and helping to propel me . on stage , you appear very natural in the role of siegfried .
do you feel natural despite the rather artificial situation of performing and singing at this energy level ? i think you have to find the enthusiasm , the energy and the youthfulness in siegfried .
there are many different aspects to the character , and that 's one of the reasons he 's fascinating to play .
you think back to being around 17 or 18 - the age siegfried is supposed to be - in that rebellious phase where you 're growing , and you want to get out and discover , but you really have no idea what you 're getting into .
that 's exactly what siegfried is .
once you kind of identify with that , everything else comes with it . it 's strange with wagner - it never strikes you right away what a great musician he is because the work is just so complex .
it 's so rich and dense that you have to sift through much material in order to find how he makes it work in such a genius way .
once you 've recognized all that , then you find the road , and it carries you .
in that way , it eventually does come naturally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryan said the bayreuth stage opens up possibilities unavailable elsewhere there 's certainly a heroic aspect to the music , and wagner said siegfried was his ultimate hero even though the character is adolescent and foolish .
why would siegfried be considered a hero ? it 's a great comparison when you take siegfried and siegmund , siegfried 's father .
siegmund had his father there to guide and teach him how to hunt and fight and deal with certain situations , but siegfried did n't have that .
he only had mime , this dwarf who never really loved him .
so i think one of the great tragedies in the work is that siegfried is a kind of dysfunctional character .

he shared his thoughts with deutsche welle on the character of siegfried and performing at the celebrated festival . canadian lance ryan , who resides in karlsruhe , germany , first performed in germany in 2005 as " otello " at the staedtische buehnen muenster .
he 's sung at opera houses around the world , including at the vienna state opera and the frankfurt opera house .
a german opera magazine called him " sensational " in his role as siegfried in richard wagner 's opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung . " the 2010 bayreuth festival draws to a close on saturday , august 28 . deutsche welle : what path led to bayreuth for you ? lance ryan : i think it began with debuting the role of siegfried and initially having some success ; the word started to spread .
from what i understand , -lsb- bayreuth festival co-director -rsb- eva wagner-pasquier first heard me in stuttgart in " the flying dutchman , " and then she came to hear me once again in mulhouse when we were doing " siegfried . "
she really liked what she heard , and , at that point , a dialogue started to open between her and my agent . i think in september she first said they thought they needed a new siegfried for this coming summer .
it was short notice in operatic terms - 11 months - but i had the summer free , and i thought , " why not ? "
at that point , i also felt i owed something to frau wagner for spreading the good word about me and helping to propel me . on stage , you appear very natural in the role of siegfried .
do you feel natural despite the rather artificial situation of performing and singing at this energy level ? i think you have to find the enthusiasm , the energy and the youthfulness in siegfried .
there are many different aspects to the character , and that 's one of the reasons he 's fascinating to play .
you think back to being around 17 or 18 - the age siegfried is supposed to be - in that rebellious phase where you 're growing , and you want to get out and discover , but you really have no idea what you 're getting into .
that 's exactly what siegfried is .
once you kind of identify with that , everything else comes with it . it 's strange with wagner - it never strikes you right away what a great musician he is because the work is just so complex .
it 's so rich and dense that you have to sift through much material in order to find how he makes it work in such a genius way .
once you 've recognized all that , then you find the road , and it carries you .
in that way , it eventually does come naturally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryan said the bayreuth stage opens up possibilities unavailable elsewhere there 's certainly a heroic aspect to the music , and wagner said siegfried was his ultimate hero even though the character is adolescent and foolish .
why would siegfried be considered a hero ? it 's a great comparison when you take siegfried and siegmund , siegfried 's father .
siegmund had his father there to guide and teach him how to hunt and fight and deal with certain situations , but siegfried did n't have that .
he only had mime , this dwarf who never really loved him .
so i think one of the great tragedies in the work is that siegfried is a kind of dysfunctional character .
you have this boy with great potential but who is just born in tragic circumstances . i tend to think that wagner could identify that with his own history .
he recognized in himself what a great musician , dramatist and talent he was .
but early in his career , that was never recognized .
i think this inability to fulfill oneself in one 's youth is something he identified with , so maybe that 's why he feels siegfried was his greatest hero . i think that 's also one of the great lessons of the ring - to show what love really means and to show what can go wrong if it 's not nurtured between people . i imagine there is now a lot of demand for you to sing in new productions .
what priorities do you have musically ?
yes , there 's a lot of demand , and i have quite a few productions in view within the next five or six years .
but at the same time , i always want to keep a more lyrical side to the roles .
in the market , once you have a stamp or an identity , that 's what the theaters want because they want to say , " we have this singer in this role . "
it 's a marketing thing , and that 's just the way it is in modern society .
there 's a commercial aspect to it all now , in contrast to 100 years ago when there was more patronage . but i try to keep a balance for my vocal health and for artistic reasons .
i look for variety - something new and something lighter for my voice .
siegfried is good for my voice because the part is n't so deep .
its register still lies quite high , unlike tristan or parsifal .
with siegfried , you can keep the very tenor aspects , and when you do , i think the more heroic qualities come out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva wagner-pasquier -lrb- right -rrb- noticed ryan 's talent and helped recruit him for bayreuth how would you describe your first experience performing on the wagner stage ? it 's great - an amazing theater with an amazing acoustic .
i think the biggest difference for me was the way the orchestra pit is divided .
as a singer on stage , you hear the violins very clearly , but you do n't hear the horns and woodwinds as well as you normally would .
so , you have a different sound from the orchestra as an artist on stage , and you have to take note of that . other than that , the acoustic here gives you great confidence that you can do more vocally and artistically with color because you know the audience can almost always hear you .
like conductor christian thielemann has said , " you do n't have to sing so loud , we will adjust . "
that 's excellent to hear a conductor say that .
then you know you can play vocally - with lightness and color - and you do n't have to think " can the audience hear me ? " with this conductor and this stage , you feel that you can do things that you might not be able to do anywhere else .

he shared his thoughts with deutsche welle on the character of siegfried and performing at the celebrated festival . canadian lance ryan , who resides in karlsruhe , germany , first performed in germany in 2005 as " otello " at the staedtische buehnen muenster .
he 's sung at opera houses around the world , including at the vienna state opera and the frankfurt opera house .
a german opera magazine called him " sensational " in his role as siegfried in richard wagner 's opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung . " the 2010 bayreuth festival draws to a close on saturday , august 28 . deutsche welle : what path led to bayreuth for you ? lance ryan : i think it began with debuting the role of siegfried and initially having some success ; the word started to spread .
from what i understand , -lsb- bayreuth festival co-director -rsb- eva wagner-pasquier first heard me in stuttgart in " the flying dutchman , " and then she came to hear me once again in mulhouse when we were doing " siegfried . "
she really liked what she heard , and , at that point , a dialogue started to open between her and my agent . i think in september she first said they thought they needed a new siegfried for this coming summer .
it was short notice in operatic terms - 11 months - but i had the summer free , and i thought , " why not ? "
at that point , i also felt i owed something to frau wagner for spreading the good word about me and helping to propel me . on stage , you appear very natural in the role of siegfried .
do you feel natural despite the rather artificial situation of performing and singing at this energy level ? i think you have to find the enthusiasm , the energy and the youthfulness in siegfried .
there are many different aspects to the character , and that 's one of the reasons he 's fascinating to play .
you think back to being around 17 or 18 - the age siegfried is supposed to be - in that rebellious phase where you 're growing , and you want to get out and discover , but you really have no idea what you 're getting into .
that 's exactly what siegfried is .
once you kind of identify with that , everything else comes with it . it 's strange with wagner - it never strikes you right away what a great musician he is because the work is just so complex .
it 's so rich and dense that you have to sift through much material in order to find how he makes it work in such a genius way .
once you 've recognized all that , then you find the road , and it carries you .
in that way , it eventually does come naturally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryan said the bayreuth stage opens up possibilities unavailable elsewhere there 's certainly a heroic aspect to the music , and wagner said siegfried was his ultimate hero even though the character is adolescent and foolish .
why would siegfried be considered a hero ? it 's a great comparison when you take siegfried and siegmund , siegfried 's father .
siegmund had his father there to guide and teach him how to hunt and fight and deal with certain situations , but siegfried did n't have that .
he only had mime , this dwarf who never really loved him .
so i think one of the great tragedies in the work is that siegfried is a kind of dysfunctional character .
you have this boy with great potential but who is just born in tragic circumstances . i tend to think that wagner could identify that with his own history .
he recognized in himself what a great musician , dramatist and talent he was .
but early in his career , that was never recognized .
i think this inability to fulfill oneself in one 's youth is something he identified with , so maybe that 's why he feels siegfried was his greatest hero . i think that 's also one of the great lessons of the ring - to show what love really means and to show what can go wrong if it 's not nurtured between people . i imagine there is now a lot of demand for you to sing in new productions .
what priorities do you have musically ?
yes , there 's a lot of demand , and i have quite a few productions in view within the next five or six years .
but at the same time , i always want to keep a more lyrical side to the roles .
in the market , once you have a stamp or an identity , that 's what the theaters want because they want to say , " we have this singer in this role . "
it 's a marketing thing , and that 's just the way it is in modern society .
there 's a commercial aspect to it all now , in contrast to 100 years ago when there was more patronage . but i try to keep a balance for my vocal health and for artistic reasons .
i look for variety - something new and something lighter for my voice .
siegfried is good for my voice because the part is n't so deep .
its register still lies quite high , unlike tristan or parsifal .
with siegfried , you can keep the very tenor aspects , and when you do , i think the more heroic qualities come out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva wagner-pasquier -lrb- right -rrb- noticed ryan 's talent and helped recruit him for bayreuth how would you describe your first experience performing on the wagner stage ? it 's great - an amazing theater with an amazing acoustic .
i think the biggest difference for me was the way the orchestra pit is divided .
as a singer on stage , you hear the violins very clearly , but you do n't hear the horns and woodwinds as well as you normally would .
so , you have a different sound from the orchestra as an artist on stage , and you have to take note of that . other than that , the acoustic here gives you great confidence that you can do more vocally and artistically with color because you know the audience can almost always hear you .
like conductor christian thielemann has said , " you do n't have to sing so loud , we will adjust . "
that 's excellent to hear a conductor say that .
then you know you can play vocally - with lightness and color - and you do n't have to think " can the audience hear me ? " with this conductor and this stage , you feel that you can do things that you might not be able to do anywhere else .

she really liked what she heard , and , at that point , a dialogue started to open between her and my agent . i think in september she first said they thought they needed a new siegfried for this coming summer .
it was short notice in operatic terms - 11 months - but i had the summer free , and i thought , " why not ? "
at that point , i also felt i owed something to frau wagner for spreading the good word about me and helping to propel me . on stage , you appear very natural in the role of siegfried .
do you feel natural despite the rather artificial situation of performing and singing at this energy level ? i think you have to find the enthusiasm , the energy and the youthfulness in siegfried .
there are many different aspects to the character , and that 's one of the reasons he 's fascinating to play .
you think back to being around 17 or 18 - the age siegfried is supposed to be - in that rebellious phase where you 're growing , and you want to get out and discover , but you really have no idea what you 're getting into .
that 's exactly what siegfried is .
once you kind of identify with that , everything else comes with it . it 's strange with wagner - it never strikes you right away what a great musician he is because the work is just so complex .
it 's so rich and dense that you have to sift through much material in order to find how he makes it work in such a genius way .
once you 've recognized all that , then you find the road , and it carries you .
in that way , it eventually does come naturally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryan said the bayreuth stage opens up possibilities unavailable elsewhere there 's certainly a heroic aspect to the music , and wagner said siegfried was his ultimate hero even though the character is adolescent and foolish .
why would siegfried be considered a hero ? it 's a great comparison when you take siegfried and siegmund , siegfried 's father .
siegmund had his father there to guide and teach him how to hunt and fight and deal with certain situations , but siegfried did n't have that .
he only had mime , this dwarf who never really loved him .
so i think one of the great tragedies in the work is that siegfried is a kind of dysfunctional character .
you have this boy with great potential but who is just born in tragic circumstances . i tend to think that wagner could identify that with his own history .
he recognized in himself what a great musician , dramatist and talent he was .
but early in his career , that was never recognized .
i think this inability to fulfill oneself in one 's youth is something he identified with , so maybe that 's why he feels siegfried was his greatest hero . i think that 's also one of the great lessons of the ring - to show what love really means and to show what can go wrong if it 's not nurtured between people . i imagine there is now a lot of demand for you to sing in new productions .
what priorities do you have musically ?
yes , there 's a lot of demand , and i have quite a few productions in view within the next five or six years .
but at the same time , i always want to keep a more lyrical side to the roles .
in the market , once you have a stamp or an identity , that 's what the theaters want because they want to say , " we have this singer in this role . "
it 's a marketing thing , and that 's just the way it is in modern society .
there 's a commercial aspect to it all now , in contrast to 100 years ago when there was more patronage . but i try to keep a balance for my vocal health and for artistic reasons .
i look for variety - something new and something lighter for my voice .
siegfried is good for my voice because the part is n't so deep .
its register still lies quite high , unlike tristan or parsifal .
with siegfried , you can keep the very tenor aspects , and when you do , i think the more heroic qualities come out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva wagner-pasquier -lrb- right -rrb- noticed ryan 's talent and helped recruit him for bayreuth how would you describe your first experience performing on the wagner stage ? it 's great - an amazing theater with an amazing acoustic .
i think the biggest difference for me was the way the orchestra pit is divided .
as a singer on stage , you hear the violins very clearly , but you do n't hear the horns and woodwinds as well as you normally would .
so , you have a different sound from the orchestra as an artist on stage , and you have to take note of that . other than that , the acoustic here gives you great confidence that you can do more vocally and artistically with color because you know the audience can almost always hear you .
like conductor christian thielemann has said , " you do n't have to sing so loud , we will adjust . "
that 's excellent to hear a conductor say that .
then you know you can play vocally - with lightness and color - and you do n't have to think " can the audience hear me ? " with this conductor and this stage , you feel that you can do things that you might not be able to do anywhere else .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kolat called on the government to act to remove sarrazin " i am calling upon the government to begin a procedure to remove thilo sarrazin from the board of the central bank , " kolat told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday , august 28 .
in his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , sarrazin claims that members of germany 's muslim community pose a danger to german society . sarrazin , a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and berlin 's former finance chief , was reported in june as saying that members of the turkish and arab community were making germany " more stupid . "
with his book , kolat said , sarrazin had overstepped a boundary .
" it is the climax of a new intellectual racism and it damages germany 's reputation abroad , " kolat said .
high birth-rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says that his book is addressing cultural division in a serialization of the forthcoming book in the german popular daily newspaper bild , sarrazin said that germany 's muslim community had profited from social welfare payments far more than they contributed , and that higher birth-rates among immigrants could lead to the muslim population overtaking the " indigenous " one in terms of numbers .
merkel 's chief spokesman steffen seibert said on wednesday that many people would find the remarks " offensive " and " defamatory , " adding that the chancellor was concerned .
members of the spd have distanced themselves from sarrazin 's comments , while germany 's green and left parties have called for his removal from the central bank 's board .
a bundesbank spokesman said that sarrazin 's latest remarks were personal opinions , unconnected with his role on the board .
blanket generalizations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first female muslim minister said the comments lacked respect lower saxony 's minister of social affairs , ayguel oezkan , germany 's first-ever female muslim minister , accused sarrazin of doing damage to the muslim community with blanket generalizations .
" there are a vast number of hard-working immigrants , " she told the weekly german newspaper bild am sonntag ahead of its publication on sunday .
" they deserve respect , not malice . "
" all of those who are involved in society , those who encourage their children , who learn german , who work and pay taxes and those who , as entrepreneurs , provide jobs – all of them deserve respect . "
in june , 65-year-old sarrazin was reported as saying that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because immigrants were poorly educated .
' distorted image , half-truths ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin claims german society is being undermined by the muslim community maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , accused sarrazin of giving " a distorted image of integration in germany " that did not bear up to academic scrutiny .
" in his comments , he states only half truths , " she told bild am sonntag .
" it is indisputable that , in education , there are currently a lot of immigrants with a lot of catching up to do .
it does not take sarrazin 's comments to establish that . "
in a lengthy interview with weekly newspaper die zeit , sarrazin defended himself against the charge he was encouraging racism .
" i am not a racist , " he told the newspaper .
" the book addresses cultural divisions , not ethnic ones . "
last year , sarrazin caused a storm by claiming that most of berlin 's arab and turkish immigrants had no useful function " apart from fruit and vegetable trading . "
as a result , the central bank stripped sarrazin of some of his duties .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kolat called on the government to act to remove sarrazin " i am calling upon the government to begin a procedure to remove thilo sarrazin from the board of the central bank , " kolat told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday , august 28 .
in his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , sarrazin claims that members of germany 's muslim community pose a danger to german society . sarrazin , a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and berlin 's former finance chief , was reported in june as saying that members of the turkish and arab community were making germany " more stupid . "
with his book , kolat said , sarrazin had overstepped a boundary .
" it is the climax of a new intellectual racism and it damages germany 's reputation abroad , " kolat said .
high birth-rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says that his book is addressing cultural division in a serialization of the forthcoming book in the german popular daily newspaper bild , sarrazin said that germany 's muslim community had profited from social welfare payments far more than they contributed , and that higher birth-rates among immigrants could lead to the muslim population overtaking the " indigenous " one in terms of numbers .
merkel 's chief spokesman steffen seibert said on wednesday that many people would find the remarks " offensive " and " defamatory , " adding that the chancellor was concerned .
members of the spd have distanced themselves from sarrazin 's comments , while germany 's green and left parties have called for his removal from the central bank 's board .
a bundesbank spokesman said that sarrazin 's latest remarks were personal opinions , unconnected with his role on the board .
blanket generalizations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first female muslim minister said the comments lacked respect lower saxony 's minister of social affairs , ayguel oezkan , germany 's first-ever female muslim minister , accused sarrazin of doing damage to the muslim community with blanket generalizations .
" there are a vast number of hard-working immigrants , " she told the weekly german newspaper bild am sonntag ahead of its publication on sunday .
" they deserve respect , not malice . "
" all of those who are involved in society , those who encourage their children , who learn german , who work and pay taxes and those who , as entrepreneurs , provide jobs – all of them deserve respect . "
in june , 65-year-old sarrazin was reported as saying that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because immigrants were poorly educated .
' distorted image , half-truths ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin claims german society is being undermined by the muslim community maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , accused sarrazin of giving " a distorted image of integration in germany " that did not bear up to academic scrutiny .
" in his comments , he states only half truths , " she told bild am sonntag .
" it is indisputable that , in education , there are currently a lot of immigrants with a lot of catching up to do .
it does not take sarrazin 's comments to establish that . "
in a lengthy interview with weekly newspaper die zeit , sarrazin defended himself against the charge he was encouraging racism .
" i am not a racist , " he told the newspaper .
" the book addresses cultural divisions , not ethnic ones . "
last year , sarrazin caused a storm by claiming that most of berlin 's arab and turkish immigrants had no useful function " apart from fruit and vegetable trading . "
as a result , the central bank stripped sarrazin of some of his duties .

high birth-rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says that his book is addressing cultural division in a serialization of the forthcoming book in the german popular daily newspaper bild , sarrazin said that germany 's muslim community had profited from social welfare payments far more than they contributed , and that higher birth-rates among immigrants could lead to the muslim population overtaking the " indigenous " one in terms of numbers .
merkel 's chief spokesman steffen seibert said on wednesday that many people would find the remarks " offensive " and " defamatory , " adding that the chancellor was concerned .
members of the spd have distanced themselves from sarrazin 's comments , while germany 's green and left parties have called for his removal from the central bank 's board .
a bundesbank spokesman said that sarrazin 's latest remarks were personal opinions , unconnected with his role on the board .
blanket generalizations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first female muslim minister said the comments lacked respect lower saxony 's minister of social affairs , ayguel oezkan , germany 's first-ever female muslim minister , accused sarrazin of doing damage to the muslim community with blanket generalizations .
" there are a vast number of hard-working immigrants , " she told the weekly german newspaper bild am sonntag ahead of its publication on sunday .
" they deserve respect , not malice . "
" all of those who are involved in society , those who encourage their children , who learn german , who work and pay taxes and those who , as entrepreneurs , provide jobs – all of them deserve respect . "
in june , 65-year-old sarrazin was reported as saying that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because immigrants were poorly educated .
' distorted image , half-truths ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin claims german society is being undermined by the muslim community maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , accused sarrazin of giving " a distorted image of integration in germany " that did not bear up to academic scrutiny .
" in his comments , he states only half truths , " she told bild am sonntag .
" it is indisputable that , in education , there are currently a lot of immigrants with a lot of catching up to do .
it does not take sarrazin 's comments to establish that . "
in a lengthy interview with weekly newspaper die zeit , sarrazin defended himself against the charge he was encouraging racism .
" i am not a racist , " he told the newspaper .
" the book addresses cultural divisions , not ethnic ones . "
last year , sarrazin caused a storm by claiming that most of berlin 's arab and turkish immigrants had no useful function " apart from fruit and vegetable trading . "
as a result , the central bank stripped sarrazin of some of his duties .

it will also make journey times faster , with the current terminus station being turned into a through-station , meaning trains will no longer have to reverse out . stuttgart police estimated the friday crowd at 10,000 . political fallout a survey published in the local stuttgarter nachrichten this week showed that 63 percent of the city 's residents are against the project , with just 26 percent in favor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the station 's north wing has already been demolished " these are n't radicals , it 's the people in the middle , " political scientist gero neugebauer told the reuters news agency .
" it should make the main political parties think twice .
they always say they want people to stand up and be counted but now they 're standing up and the leaders are turning a deaf ear . " the opposition to the stuttgart rail station project could have an impact on chancellor angela merkel 's government .
her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have ruled the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg since 1953 , but face an uphill struggle to hold onto power in the upcoming elections in march 2011 . " it will turn into a big problem for merkel if the cdu lose baden-wuerttemberg , " neugebauer said .
polls have shown the opposition center-left social democrats and greens ahead of the cdu and free democrats , who also form the coalition with merkel on the federal level in berlin . the project , part funded by the european union , aims to make stuttgart part of one of the longest high-speed lines in europe , linking paris , strasbourg , munich , vienna , bratislava and budapest . author : joanna impey -lrb- afp / ap / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government faces resistance if it presses ahead . a study commissioned by the german government has recommended an extension of up to 20 years to the life of nuclear power plants , according to reports . experts from germany 's institute of energy economics at the university of cologne -lrb- ewi -rrb- were asked to give their advice to the government on a range of scenarios about extending the operational lifetimes of plants by four , 12 , 20 and 28 years . the study recommended that nuclear power plants should be kept open for between 12 and 20 years more than currently planned , the german news magazine focus reported saturday . a number of studies , many of which have come to different conclusions , have been recently issued by think-tanks and environmental organizations . after a tour of power plants around the country , german chancellor angela merkel said on friday that renewable energies should supply half of all energy needs by 2050 and that nuclear and coal power would continue until supplies could be met entirely by clean energy . evaluating outcomes for climate , economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor has completed four days of touring energy facilities the assessment was based on factors such as electricity prices , energy security and carbon emissions .
according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , experts believe that an extension would allow " the best outcomes for climate protection and the economy . " the coalition government of merkel , which aims to overhaul its energy policy by the end of september , received the study on friday .
the phasing out of german power plants had been planned by merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schroeder . according to a law passed in 2002 by the then-ruling spd-greens coalition , all of germany 's nuclear power plants were due to go offline by 2022 . merkel 's government has said it intends to extend that deadline .
until recently , it had been thought that any legal change would need to be approved by the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , which represents the country 's 16 states . bypassing the upper house ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state ministers plan to take a fight against any extension to the constitutional court however , after the may election in north rhine-westphalia , the center-right coalition lost its majority in the upper chamber and plans to bypass the bundesrat entirely were hinted at - infuriating opposition parties . the government now faces resistance to its plans with nine out of 16 german states opposed to them , including hamburg , thuringia and saarland which are led by merkel 's own christian democrats . ministers from both north rhine-westphalia and rhineland-palatinate have said that they will press for a judicial review in germany 's constitutional court , if the government goes ahead without bundesrat approval . a poll released by zdf television on friday showed that 56 percent of those surveyed were opposed to an extension while 38 percent supported it . author : richard connor -lrb- afp / dpa / ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kolat called on the government to act to remove sarrazin " i am calling upon the government to begin a procedure to remove thilo sarrazin from the board of the central bank , " kolat told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday , august 28 .
in his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , sarrazin claims that members of germany 's muslim community pose a danger to german society . sarrazin , a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and berlin 's former finance chief , was reported in june as saying that members of the turkish and arab community were making germany " more stupid .

merkel 's chief spokesman steffen seibert said on wednesday that many people would find the remarks " offensive " and " defamatory , " adding that the chancellor was concerned .
members of the spd have distanced themselves from sarrazin 's comments , while germany 's green and left parties have called for his removal from the central bank 's board .
a bundesbank spokesman said that sarrazin 's latest remarks were personal opinions , unconnected with his role on the board .

" they deserve respect , not malice . "
" all of those who are involved in society , those who encourage their children , who learn german , who work and pay taxes and those who , as entrepreneurs , provide jobs – all of them deserve respect . "
in june , 65-year-old sarrazin was reported as saying that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because immigrants were poorly educated .
' distorted image , half-truths ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin claims german society is being undermined by the muslim community maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , accused sarrazin of giving " a distorted image of integration in germany " that did not bear up to academic scrutiny .

" it is indisputable that , in education , there are currently a lot of immigrants with a lot of catching up to do .
it does not take sarrazin 's comments to establish that . "
in a lengthy interview with weekly newspaper die zeit , sarrazin defended himself against the charge he was encouraging racism .
" i am not a racist , " he told the newspaper .
" the book addresses cultural divisions , not ethnic ones . "
last year , sarrazin caused a storm by claiming that most of berlin 's arab and turkish immigrants had no useful function " apart from fruit and vegetable trading . "
as a result , the central bank stripped sarrazin of some of his duties .

half of the city 's historic railway station is being torn down so construction can begin . the german rail company , deutsche bahn , is paying only a fraction of the cost .
its chief , ruediger grube , issued an invitation late friday to the anti-project coalition to meet for roundtable talks next month . " we have to act like grown-ups , " he said .
at the same time gruebe affirmed that the project would go ahead , saying that legislation has been passed and contracts issued . " let 's sit down at the table and talk about things - especially the facts , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster swr , adding that pr surrounding the construction project had gone " very , very badly . " bahn wo n't delay construction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project opponents overran construction site this week gruebe added that the bahn would not submit to demands to halt construction during the discussions .
axel wieland , spokesperson for one of the groups organizing the demonstrations , said it would amount to little more than a diversionary tactic to hold talks while maintaining the construction schedule . " you ca n't have a nice conversation with us while the construction work keeps chugging along , " he told the afp news agency . protesters have picketed the building site at stuttgart 's main station for weeks .
only a small core of demonstrators was at the site saturday as work continued demolishing one wing of the station .
police counted 30,000 people friday at a protest vigil outside the state parliament in stuttgart .
the protest movement claimed 50,000 .
the protesters said they expect about 10,000 people to come to another demonstration on monday . the protesters have criticized that the costs for the project have grown from 7 billions euros to 11 billion .
proponents , however , have pointed out that work for the new train station has created 4,000 jobs , and shorter travel times that would help the environment as more people travel via rail instead of flying . only the station 's main section will remain when all the rail lines have been moved underground and the land above has been subdivided for buildings and a park . author : sean sinico -lrb- dpa / afp / ap -rrb- editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kolat called on the government to act to remove sarrazin " i am calling upon the government to begin a procedure to remove thilo sarrazin from the board of the central bank , " kolat told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday , august 28 .
in his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , sarrazin claims that members of germany 's muslim community pose a danger to german society . sarrazin , a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and berlin 's former finance chief , was reported in june as saying that members of the turkish and arab community were making germany " more stupid . "
with his book , kolat said , sarrazin had overstepped a boundary .
" it is the climax of a new intellectual racism and it damages germany 's reputation abroad , " kolat said .
high birth-rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says that his book is addressing cultural division in a serialization of the forthcoming book in the german popular daily newspaper bild , sarrazin said that germany 's muslim community had profited from social welfare payments far more than they contributed , and that higher birth-rates among immigrants could lead to the muslim population overtaking the " indigenous " one in terms of numbers .
merkel 's chief spokesman steffen seibert said on wednesday that many people would find the remarks " offensive " and " defamatory , " adding that the chancellor was concerned .
members of the spd have distanced themselves from sarrazin 's comments , while germany 's green and left parties have called for his removal from the central bank 's board .
a bundesbank spokesman said that sarrazin 's latest remarks were personal opinions , unconnected with his role on the board .
blanket generalizations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first female muslim minister said the comments lacked respect lower saxony 's minister of social affairs , ayguel oezkan , germany 's first-ever female muslim minister , accused sarrazin of doing damage to the muslim community with blanket generalizations .
" there are a vast number of hard-working immigrants , " she told the weekly german newspaper bild am sonntag ahead of its publication on sunday .
" they deserve respect , not malice . "
" all of those who are involved in society , those who encourage their children , who learn german , who work and pay taxes and those who , as entrepreneurs , provide jobs – all of them deserve respect . "
in june , 65-year-old sarrazin was reported as saying that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because immigrants were poorly educated .
' distorted image , half-truths ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin claims german society is being undermined by the muslim community maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , accused sarrazin of giving " a distorted image of integration in germany " that did not bear up to academic scrutiny .
" in his comments , he states only half truths , " she told bild am sonntag .
" it is indisputable that , in education , there are currently a lot of immigrants with a lot of catching up to do .
it does not take sarrazin 's comments to establish that . "
in a lengthy interview with weekly newspaper die zeit , sarrazin defended himself against the charge he was encouraging racism .

the government faces resistance if it presses ahead . a study commissioned by the german government has recommended an extension of up to 20 years to the life of nuclear power plants , according to reports . experts from germany 's institute of energy economics at the university of cologne -lrb- ewi -rrb- were asked to give their advice to the government on a range of scenarios about extending the operational lifetimes of plants by four , 12 , 20 and 28 years . the study recommended that nuclear power plants should be kept open for between 12 and 20 years more than currently planned , the german news magazine focus reported saturday . a number of studies , many of which have come to different conclusions , have been recently issued by think-tanks and environmental organizations . after a tour of power plants around the country , german chancellor angela merkel said on friday that renewable energies should supply half of all energy needs by 2050 and that nuclear and coal power would continue until supplies could be met entirely by clean energy . evaluating outcomes for climate , economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor has completed four days of touring energy facilities the assessment was based on factors such as electricity prices , energy security and carbon emissions .
according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , experts believe that an extension would allow " the best outcomes for climate protection and the economy . " the coalition government of merkel , which aims to overhaul its energy policy by the end of september , received the study on friday .
the phasing out of german power plants had been planned by merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schroeder . according to a law passed in 2002 by the then-ruling spd-greens coalition , all of germany 's nuclear power plants were due to go offline by 2022 . merkel 's government has said it intends to extend that deadline .
until recently , it had been thought that any legal change would need to be approved by the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , which represents the country 's 16 states . bypassing the upper house ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state ministers plan to take a fight against any extension to the constitutional court however , after the may election in north rhine-westphalia , the center-right coalition lost its majority in the upper chamber and plans to bypass the bundesrat entirely were hinted at - infuriating opposition parties . the government now faces resistance to its plans with nine out of 16 german states opposed to them , including hamburg , thuringia and saarland which are led by merkel 's own christian democrats . ministers from both north rhine-westphalia and rhineland-palatinate have said that they will press for a judicial review in germany 's constitutional court , if the government goes ahead without bundesrat approval . a poll released by zdf television on friday showed that 56 percent of those surveyed were opposed to an extension while 38 percent supported it . author : richard connor -lrb- afp / dpa / ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government faces resistance if it presses ahead . a study commissioned by the german government has recommended an extension of up to 20 years to the life of nuclear power plants , according to reports . experts from germany 's institute of energy economics at the university of cologne -lrb- ewi -rrb- were asked to give their advice to the government on a range of scenarios about extending the operational lifetimes of plants by four , 12 , 20 and 28 years . the study recommended that nuclear power plants should be kept open for between 12 and 20 years more than currently planned , the german news magazine focus reported saturday . a number of studies , many of which have come to different conclusions , have been recently issued by think-tanks and environmental organizations . after a tour of power plants around the country , german chancellor angela merkel said on friday that renewable energies should supply half of all energy needs by 2050 and that nuclear and coal power would continue until supplies could be met entirely by clean energy . evaluating outcomes for climate , economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor has completed four days of touring energy facilities the assessment was based on factors such as electricity prices , energy security and carbon emissions .
according to the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , experts believe that an extension would allow " the best outcomes for climate protection and the economy . " the coalition government of merkel , which aims to overhaul its energy policy by the end of september , received the study on friday .
the phasing out of german power plants had been planned by merkel 's predecessor , gerhard schroeder . according to a law passed in 2002 by the then-ruling spd-greens coalition , all of germany 's nuclear power plants were due to go offline by 2022 . merkel 's government has said it intends to extend that deadline .
until recently , it had been thought that any legal change would need to be approved by the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament , which represents the country 's 16 states . bypassing the upper house ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state ministers plan to take a fight against any extension to the constitutional court however , after the may election in north rhine-westphalia , the center-right coalition lost its majority in the upper chamber and plans to bypass the bundesrat entirely were hinted at - infuriating opposition parties . the government now faces resistance to its plans with nine out of 16 german states opposed to them , including hamburg , thuringia and saarland which are led by merkel 's own christian democrats . ministers from both north rhine-westphalia and rhineland-palatinate have said that they will press for a judicial review in germany 's constitutional court , if the government goes ahead without bundesrat approval . a poll released by zdf television on friday showed that 56 percent of those surveyed were opposed to an extension while 38 percent supported it . author : richard connor -lrb- afp / dpa / ap -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he shared his thoughts with deutsche welle on the character of siegfried and performing at the celebrated festival . canadian lance ryan , who resides in karlsruhe , germany , first performed in germany in 2005 as " otello " at the staedtische buehnen muenster .
he 's sung at opera houses around the world , including at the vienna state opera and the frankfurt opera house .
a german opera magazine called him " sensational " in his role as siegfried in richard wagner 's opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung . " the 2010 bayreuth festival draws to a close on saturday , august 28 . deutsche welle : what path led to bayreuth for you ? lance ryan : i think it began with debuting the role of siegfried and initially having some success ; the word started to spread .
from what i understand , -lsb- bayreuth festival co-director -rsb- eva wagner-pasquier first heard me in stuttgart in " the flying dutchman , " and then she came to hear me once again in mulhouse when we were doing " siegfried . "
she really liked what she heard , and , at that point , a dialogue started to open between her and my agent . i think in september she first said they thought they needed a new siegfried for this coming summer .
it was short notice in operatic terms - 11 months - but i had the summer free , and i thought , " why not ? "
at that point , i also felt i owed something to frau wagner for spreading the good word about me and helping to propel me . on stage , you appear very natural in the role of siegfried .
do you feel natural despite the rather artificial situation of performing and singing at this energy level ? i think you have to find the enthusiasm , the energy and the youthfulness in siegfried .
there are many different aspects to the character , and that 's one of the reasons he 's fascinating to play .
you think back to being around 17 or 18 - the age siegfried is supposed to be - in that rebellious phase where you 're growing , and you want to get out and discover , but you really have no idea what you 're getting into .
that 's exactly what siegfried is .
once you kind of identify with that , everything else comes with it . it 's strange with wagner - it never strikes you right away what a great musician he is because the work is just so complex .
it 's so rich and dense that you have to sift through much material in order to find how he makes it work in such a genius way .
once you 've recognized all that , then you find the road , and it carries you .
in that way , it eventually does come naturally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryan said the bayreuth stage opens up possibilities unavailable elsewhere there 's certainly a heroic aspect to the music , and wagner said siegfried was his ultimate hero even though the character is adolescent and foolish .
why would siegfried be considered a hero ? it 's a great comparison when you take siegfried and siegmund , siegfried 's father .
siegmund had his father there to guide and teach him how to hunt and fight and deal with certain situations , but siegfried did n't have that .
he only had mime , this dwarf who never really loved him .
so i think one of the great tragedies in the work is that siegfried is a kind of dysfunctional character .
you have this boy with great potential but who is just born in tragic circumstances . i tend to think that wagner could identify that with his own history .
he recognized in himself what a great musician , dramatist and talent he was .
but early in his career , that was never recognized .
i think this inability to fulfill oneself in one 's youth is something he identified with , so maybe that 's why he feels siegfried was his greatest hero . i think that 's also one of the great lessons of the ring - to show what love really means and to show what can go wrong if it 's not nurtured between people . i imagine there is now a lot of demand for you to sing in new productions .
what priorities do you have musically ?
yes , there 's a lot of demand , and i have quite a few productions in view within the next five or six years .
but at the same time , i always want to keep a more lyrical side to the roles .
in the market , once you have a stamp or an identity , that 's what the theaters want because they want to say , " we have this singer in this role . "
it 's a marketing thing , and that 's just the way it is in modern society .
there 's a commercial aspect to it all now , in contrast to 100 years ago when there was more patronage . but i try to keep a balance for my vocal health and for artistic reasons .
i look for variety - something new and something lighter for my voice .
siegfried is good for my voice because the part is n't so deep .
its register still lies quite high , unlike tristan or parsifal .
with siegfried , you can keep the very tenor aspects , and when you do , i think the more heroic qualities come out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva wagner-pasquier -lrb- right -rrb- noticed ryan 's talent and helped recruit him for bayreuth how would you describe your first experience performing on the wagner stage ? it 's great - an amazing theater with an amazing acoustic .
i think the biggest difference for me was the way the orchestra pit is divided .
as a singer on stage , you hear the violins very clearly , but you do n't hear the horns and woodwinds as well as you normally would .
so , you have a different sound from the orchestra as an artist on stage , and you have to take note of that . other than that , the acoustic here gives you great confidence that you can do more vocally and artistically with color because you know the audience can almost always hear you .
like conductor christian thielemann has said , " you do n't have to sing so loud , we will adjust . "
that 's excellent to hear a conductor say that .
then you know you can play vocally - with lightness and color - and you do n't have to think " can the audience hear me ? " with this conductor and this stage , you feel that you can do things that you might not be able to do anywhere else .

he shared his thoughts with deutsche welle on the character of siegfried and performing at the celebrated festival . canadian lance ryan , who resides in karlsruhe , germany , first performed in germany in 2005 as " otello " at the staedtische buehnen muenster .
he 's sung at opera houses around the world , including at the vienna state opera and the frankfurt opera house .
a german opera magazine called him " sensational " in his role as siegfried in richard wagner 's opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung . " the 2010 bayreuth festival draws to a close on saturday , august 28 . deutsche welle : what path led to bayreuth for you ? lance ryan : i think it began with debuting the role of siegfried and initially having some success ; the word started to spread .
from what i understand , -lsb- bayreuth festival co-director -rsb- eva wagner-pasquier first heard me in stuttgart in " the flying dutchman , " and then she came to hear me once again in mulhouse when we were doing " siegfried . "
she really liked what she heard , and , at that point , a dialogue started to open between her and my agent . i think in september she first said they thought they needed a new siegfried for this coming summer .
it was short notice in operatic terms - 11 months - but i had the summer free , and i thought , " why not ? "
at that point , i also felt i owed something to frau wagner for spreading the good word about me and helping to propel me . on stage , you appear very natural in the role of siegfried .
do you feel natural despite the rather artificial situation of performing and singing at this energy level ? i think you have to find the enthusiasm , the energy and the youthfulness in siegfried .
there are many different aspects to the character , and that 's one of the reasons he 's fascinating to play .
you think back to being around 17 or 18 - the age siegfried is supposed to be - in that rebellious phase where you 're growing , and you want to get out and discover , but you really have no idea what you 're getting into .
that 's exactly what siegfried is .
once you kind of identify with that , everything else comes with it . it 's strange with wagner - it never strikes you right away what a great musician he is because the work is just so complex .
it 's so rich and dense that you have to sift through much material in order to find how he makes it work in such a genius way .
once you 've recognized all that , then you find the road , and it carries you .
in that way , it eventually does come naturally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryan said the bayreuth stage opens up possibilities unavailable elsewhere there 's certainly a heroic aspect to the music , and wagner said siegfried was his ultimate hero even though the character is adolescent and foolish .
why would siegfried be considered a hero ? it 's a great comparison when you take siegfried and siegmund , siegfried 's father .
siegmund had his father there to guide and teach him how to hunt and fight and deal with certain situations , but siegfried did n't have that .
he only had mime , this dwarf who never really loved him .
so i think one of the great tragedies in the work is that siegfried is a kind of dysfunctional character .
you have this boy with great potential but who is just born in tragic circumstances . i tend to think that wagner could identify that with his own history .
he recognized in himself what a great musician , dramatist and talent he was .
but early in his career , that was never recognized .
i think this inability to fulfill oneself in one 's youth is something he identified with , so maybe that 's why he feels siegfried was his greatest hero . i think that 's also one of the great lessons of the ring - to show what love really means and to show what can go wrong if it 's not nurtured between people . i imagine there is now a lot of demand for you to sing in new productions .
what priorities do you have musically ?
yes , there 's a lot of demand , and i have quite a few productions in view within the next five or six years .
but at the same time , i always want to keep a more lyrical side to the roles .
in the market , once you have a stamp or an identity , that 's what the theaters want because they want to say , " we have this singer in this role . "
it 's a marketing thing , and that 's just the way it is in modern society .
there 's a commercial aspect to it all now , in contrast to 100 years ago when there was more patronage . but i try to keep a balance for my vocal health and for artistic reasons .
i look for variety - something new and something lighter for my voice .
siegfried is good for my voice because the part is n't so deep .
its register still lies quite high , unlike tristan or parsifal .
with siegfried , you can keep the very tenor aspects , and when you do , i think the more heroic qualities come out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva wagner-pasquier -lrb- right -rrb- noticed ryan 's talent and helped recruit him for bayreuth how would you describe your first experience performing on the wagner stage ? it 's great - an amazing theater with an amazing acoustic .
i think the biggest difference for me was the way the orchestra pit is divided .
as a singer on stage , you hear the violins very clearly , but you do n't hear the horns and woodwinds as well as you normally would .
so , you have a different sound from the orchestra as an artist on stage , and you have to take note of that . other than that , the acoustic here gives you great confidence that you can do more vocally and artistically with color because you know the audience can almost always hear you .
like conductor christian thielemann has said , " you do n't have to sing so loud , we will adjust . "
that 's excellent to hear a conductor say that .
then you know you can play vocally - with lightness and color - and you do n't have to think " can the audience hear me ? " with this conductor and this stage , you feel that you can do things that you might not be able to do anywhere else .

she really liked what she heard , and , at that point , a dialogue started to open between her and my agent . i think in september she first said they thought they needed a new siegfried for this coming summer .
it was short notice in operatic terms - 11 months - but i had the summer free , and i thought , " why not ? "
at that point , i also felt i owed something to frau wagner for spreading the good word about me and helping to propel me . on stage , you appear very natural in the role of siegfried .
do you feel natural despite the rather artificial situation of performing and singing at this energy level ? i think you have to find the enthusiasm , the energy and the youthfulness in siegfried .
there are many different aspects to the character , and that 's one of the reasons he 's fascinating to play .
you think back to being around 17 or 18 - the age siegfried is supposed to be - in that rebellious phase where you 're growing , and you want to get out and discover , but you really have no idea what you 're getting into .
that 's exactly what siegfried is .
once you kind of identify with that , everything else comes with it . it 's strange with wagner - it never strikes you right away what a great musician he is because the work is just so complex .
it 's so rich and dense that you have to sift through much material in order to find how he makes it work in such a genius way .
once you 've recognized all that , then you find the road , and it carries you .
in that way , it eventually does come naturally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryan said the bayreuth stage opens up possibilities unavailable elsewhere there 's certainly a heroic aspect to the music , and wagner said siegfried was his ultimate hero even though the character is adolescent and foolish .
why would siegfried be considered a hero ? it 's a great comparison when you take siegfried and siegmund , siegfried 's father .
siegmund had his father there to guide and teach him how to hunt and fight and deal with certain situations , but siegfried did n't have that .
he only had mime , this dwarf who never really loved him .
so i think one of the great tragedies in the work is that siegfried is a kind of dysfunctional character .
you have this boy with great potential but who is just born in tragic circumstances . i tend to think that wagner could identify that with his own history .
he recognized in himself what a great musician , dramatist and talent he was .
but early in his career , that was never recognized .
i think this inability to fulfill oneself in one 's youth is something he identified with , so maybe that 's why he feels siegfried was his greatest hero . i think that 's also one of the great lessons of the ring - to show what love really means and to show what can go wrong if it 's not nurtured between people . i imagine there is now a lot of demand for you to sing in new productions .
what priorities do you have musically ?
yes , there 's a lot of demand , and i have quite a few productions in view within the next five or six years .
but at the same time , i always want to keep a more lyrical side to the roles .
in the market , once you have a stamp or an identity , that 's what the theaters want because they want to say , " we have this singer in this role . "
it 's a marketing thing , and that 's just the way it is in modern society .
there 's a commercial aspect to it all now , in contrast to 100 years ago when there was more patronage . but i try to keep a balance for my vocal health and for artistic reasons .
i look for variety - something new and something lighter for my voice .
siegfried is good for my voice because the part is n't so deep .
its register still lies quite high , unlike tristan or parsifal .
with siegfried , you can keep the very tenor aspects , and when you do , i think the more heroic qualities come out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva wagner-pasquier -lrb- right -rrb- noticed ryan 's talent and helped recruit him for bayreuth how would you describe your first experience performing on the wagner stage ? it 's great - an amazing theater with an amazing acoustic .
i think the biggest difference for me was the way the orchestra pit is divided .
as a singer on stage , you hear the violins very clearly , but you do n't hear the horns and woodwinds as well as you normally would .
so , you have a different sound from the orchestra as an artist on stage , and you have to take note of that . other than that , the acoustic here gives you great confidence that you can do more vocally and artistically with color because you know the audience can almost always hear you .
like conductor christian thielemann has said , " you do n't have to sing so loud , we will adjust . "
that 's excellent to hear a conductor say that .
then you know you can play vocally - with lightness and color - and you do n't have to think " can the audience hear me ? " with this conductor and this stage , you feel that you can do things that you might not be able to do anywhere else .

but early in his career , that was never recognized .
i think this inability to fulfill oneself in one 's youth is something he identified with , so maybe that 's why he feels siegfried was his greatest hero . i think that 's also one of the great lessons of the ring - to show what love really means and to show what can go wrong if it 's not nurtured between people . i imagine there is now a lot of demand for you to sing in new productions .
what priorities do you have musically ?
yes , there 's a lot of demand , and i have quite a few productions in view within the next five or six years .
but at the same time , i always want to keep a more lyrical side to the roles .
in the market , once you have a stamp or an identity , that 's what the theaters want because they want to say , " we have this singer in this role . "
it 's a marketing thing , and that 's just the way it is in modern society .
there 's a commercial aspect to it all now , in contrast to 100 years ago when there was more patronage . but i try to keep a balance for my vocal health and for artistic reasons .
i look for variety - something new and something lighter for my voice .
siegfried is good for my voice because the part is n't so deep .
its register still lies quite high , unlike tristan or parsifal .
with siegfried , you can keep the very tenor aspects , and when you do , i think the more heroic qualities come out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva wagner-pasquier -lrb- right -rrb- noticed ryan 's talent and helped recruit him for bayreuth how would you describe your first experience performing on the wagner stage ? it 's great - an amazing theater with an amazing acoustic .
i think the biggest difference for me was the way the orchestra pit is divided .
as a singer on stage , you hear the violins very clearly , but you do n't hear the horns and woodwinds as well as you normally would .
so , you have a different sound from the orchestra as an artist on stage , and you have to take note of that . other than that , the acoustic here gives you great confidence that you can do more vocally and artistically with color because you know the audience can almost always hear you .
like conductor christian thielemann has said , " you do n't have to sing so loud , we will adjust . "
that 's excellent to hear a conductor say that .
then you know you can play vocally - with lightness and color - and you do n't have to think " can the audience hear me ? " with this conductor and this stage , you feel that you can do things that you might not be able to do anywhere else .

he shared his thoughts with deutsche welle on the character of siegfried and performing at the celebrated festival . canadian lance ryan , who resides in karlsruhe , germany , first performed in germany in 2005 as " otello " at the staedtische buehnen muenster .
he 's sung at opera houses around the world , including at the vienna state opera and the frankfurt opera house .
a german opera magazine called him " sensational " in his role as siegfried in richard wagner 's opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung . " the 2010 bayreuth festival draws to a close on saturday , august 28 . deutsche welle : what path led to bayreuth for you ? lance ryan : i think it began with debuting the role of siegfried and initially having some success ; the word started to spread .
from what i understand , -lsb- bayreuth festival co-director -rsb- eva wagner-pasquier first heard me in stuttgart in " the flying dutchman , " and then she came to hear me once again in mulhouse when we were doing " siegfried . "
she really liked what she heard , and , at that point , a dialogue started to open between her and my agent . i think in september she first said they thought they needed a new siegfried for this coming summer .
it was short notice in operatic terms - 11 months - but i had the summer free , and i thought , " why not ? "
at that point , i also felt i owed something to frau wagner for spreading the good word about me and helping to propel me . on stage , you appear very natural in the role of siegfried .
do you feel natural despite the rather artificial situation of performing and singing at this energy level ? i think you have to find the enthusiasm , the energy and the youthfulness in siegfried .
there are many different aspects to the character , and that 's one of the reasons he 's fascinating to play .
you think back to being around 17 or 18 - the age siegfried is supposed to be - in that rebellious phase where you 're growing , and you want to get out and discover , but you really have no idea what you 're getting into .
that 's exactly what siegfried is .
once you kind of identify with that , everything else comes with it . it 's strange with wagner - it never strikes you right away what a great musician he is because the work is just so complex .
it 's so rich and dense that you have to sift through much material in order to find how he makes it work in such a genius way .
once you 've recognized all that , then you find the road , and it carries you .
in that way , it eventually does come naturally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryan said the bayreuth stage opens up possibilities unavailable elsewhere there 's certainly a heroic aspect to the music , and wagner said siegfried was his ultimate hero even though the character is adolescent and foolish .
why would siegfried be considered a hero ? it 's a great comparison when you take siegfried and siegmund , siegfried 's father .
siegmund had his father there to guide and teach him how to hunt and fight and deal with certain situations , but siegfried did n't have that .
he only had mime , this dwarf who never really loved him .
so i think one of the great tragedies in the work is that siegfried is a kind of dysfunctional character .

he shared his thoughts with deutsche welle on the character of siegfried and performing at the celebrated festival . canadian lance ryan , who resides in karlsruhe , germany , first performed in germany in 2005 as " otello " at the staedtische buehnen muenster .
he 's sung at opera houses around the world , including at the vienna state opera and the frankfurt opera house .
a german opera magazine called him " sensational " in his role as siegfried in richard wagner 's opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung . " the 2010 bayreuth festival draws to a close on saturday , august 28 . deutsche welle : what path led to bayreuth for you ? lance ryan : i think it began with debuting the role of siegfried and initially having some success ; the word started to spread .
from what i understand , -lsb- bayreuth festival co-director -rsb- eva wagner-pasquier first heard me in stuttgart in " the flying dutchman , " and then she came to hear me once again in mulhouse when we were doing " siegfried . "
she really liked what she heard , and , at that point , a dialogue started to open between her and my agent . i think in september she first said they thought they needed a new siegfried for this coming summer .
it was short notice in operatic terms - 11 months - but i had the summer free , and i thought , " why not ? "
at that point , i also felt i owed something to frau wagner for spreading the good word about me and helping to propel me . on stage , you appear very natural in the role of siegfried .
do you feel natural despite the rather artificial situation of performing and singing at this energy level ? i think you have to find the enthusiasm , the energy and the youthfulness in siegfried .
there are many different aspects to the character , and that 's one of the reasons he 's fascinating to play .
you think back to being around 17 or 18 - the age siegfried is supposed to be - in that rebellious phase where you 're growing , and you want to get out and discover , but you really have no idea what you 're getting into .
that 's exactly what siegfried is .
once you kind of identify with that , everything else comes with it . it 's strange with wagner - it never strikes you right away what a great musician he is because the work is just so complex .
it 's so rich and dense that you have to sift through much material in order to find how he makes it work in such a genius way .
once you 've recognized all that , then you find the road , and it carries you .
in that way , it eventually does come naturally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryan said the bayreuth stage opens up possibilities unavailable elsewhere there 's certainly a heroic aspect to the music , and wagner said siegfried was his ultimate hero even though the character is adolescent and foolish .
why would siegfried be considered a hero ? it 's a great comparison when you take siegfried and siegmund , siegfried 's father .
siegmund had his father there to guide and teach him how to hunt and fight and deal with certain situations , but siegfried did n't have that .
he only had mime , this dwarf who never really loved him .
so i think one of the great tragedies in the work is that siegfried is a kind of dysfunctional character .
you have this boy with great potential but who is just born in tragic circumstances . i tend to think that wagner could identify that with his own history .
he recognized in himself what a great musician , dramatist and talent he was .
but early in his career , that was never recognized .
i think this inability to fulfill oneself in one 's youth is something he identified with , so maybe that 's why he feels siegfried was his greatest hero . i think that 's also one of the great lessons of the ring - to show what love really means and to show what can go wrong if it 's not nurtured between people . i imagine there is now a lot of demand for you to sing in new productions .
what priorities do you have musically ?
yes , there 's a lot of demand , and i have quite a few productions in view within the next five or six years .
but at the same time , i always want to keep a more lyrical side to the roles .
in the market , once you have a stamp or an identity , that 's what the theaters want because they want to say , " we have this singer in this role . "
it 's a marketing thing , and that 's just the way it is in modern society .
there 's a commercial aspect to it all now , in contrast to 100 years ago when there was more patronage . but i try to keep a balance for my vocal health and for artistic reasons .
i look for variety - something new and something lighter for my voice .
siegfried is good for my voice because the part is n't so deep .
its register still lies quite high , unlike tristan or parsifal .
with siegfried , you can keep the very tenor aspects , and when you do , i think the more heroic qualities come out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva wagner-pasquier -lrb- right -rrb- noticed ryan 's talent and helped recruit him for bayreuth how would you describe your first experience performing on the wagner stage ? it 's great - an amazing theater with an amazing acoustic .
i think the biggest difference for me was the way the orchestra pit is divided .
as a singer on stage , you hear the violins very clearly , but you do n't hear the horns and woodwinds as well as you normally would .
so , you have a different sound from the orchestra as an artist on stage , and you have to take note of that . other than that , the acoustic here gives you great confidence that you can do more vocally and artistically with color because you know the audience can almost always hear you .
like conductor christian thielemann has said , " you do n't have to sing so loud , we will adjust . "
that 's excellent to hear a conductor say that .
then you know you can play vocally - with lightness and color - and you do n't have to think " can the audience hear me ? " with this conductor and this stage , you feel that you can do things that you might not be able to do anywhere else .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kolat called on the government to act to remove sarrazin " i am calling upon the government to begin a procedure to remove thilo sarrazin from the board of the central bank , " kolat told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday , august 28 .
in his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , sarrazin claims that members of germany 's muslim community pose a danger to german society . sarrazin , a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and berlin 's former finance chief , was reported in june as saying that members of the turkish and arab community were making germany " more stupid . "
with his book , kolat said , sarrazin had overstepped a boundary .
" it is the climax of a new intellectual racism and it damages germany 's reputation abroad , " kolat said .
high birth-rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says that his book is addressing cultural division in a serialization of the forthcoming book in the german popular daily newspaper bild , sarrazin said that germany 's muslim community had profited from social welfare payments far more than they contributed , and that higher birth-rates among immigrants could lead to the muslim population overtaking the " indigenous " one in terms of numbers .
merkel 's chief spokesman steffen seibert said on wednesday that many people would find the remarks " offensive " and " defamatory , " adding that the chancellor was concerned .
members of the spd have distanced themselves from sarrazin 's comments , while germany 's green and left parties have called for his removal from the central bank 's board .
a bundesbank spokesman said that sarrazin 's latest remarks were personal opinions , unconnected with his role on the board .
blanket generalizations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first female muslim minister said the comments lacked respect lower saxony 's minister of social affairs , ayguel oezkan , germany 's first-ever female muslim minister , accused sarrazin of doing damage to the muslim community with blanket generalizations .
" there are a vast number of hard-working immigrants , " she told the weekly german newspaper bild am sonntag ahead of its publication on sunday .
" they deserve respect , not malice . "
" all of those who are involved in society , those who encourage their children , who learn german , who work and pay taxes and those who , as entrepreneurs , provide jobs – all of them deserve respect . "
in june , 65-year-old sarrazin was reported as saying that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because immigrants were poorly educated .
' distorted image , half-truths ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin claims german society is being undermined by the muslim community maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , accused sarrazin of giving " a distorted image of integration in germany " that did not bear up to academic scrutiny .
" in his comments , he states only half truths , " she told bild am sonntag .
" it is indisputable that , in education , there are currently a lot of immigrants with a lot of catching up to do .
it does not take sarrazin 's comments to establish that . "
in a lengthy interview with weekly newspaper die zeit , sarrazin defended himself against the charge he was encouraging racism .
" i am not a racist , " he told the newspaper .
" the book addresses cultural divisions , not ethnic ones . "
last year , sarrazin caused a storm by claiming that most of berlin 's arab and turkish immigrants had no useful function " apart from fruit and vegetable trading . "
as a result , the central bank stripped sarrazin of some of his duties .

it will also make journey times faster , with the current terminus station being turned into a through-station , meaning trains will no longer have to reverse out . stuttgart police estimated the friday crowd at 10,000 . political fallout a survey published in the local stuttgarter nachrichten this week showed that 63 percent of the city 's residents are against the project , with just 26 percent in favor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the station 's north wing has already been demolished " these are n't radicals , it 's the people in the middle , " political scientist gero neugebauer told the reuters news agency .
" it should make the main political parties think twice .
they always say they want people to stand up and be counted but now they 're standing up and the leaders are turning a deaf ear . " the opposition to the stuttgart rail station project could have an impact on chancellor angela merkel 's government .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kolat called on the government to act to remove sarrazin " i am calling upon the government to begin a procedure to remove thilo sarrazin from the board of the central bank , " kolat told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday , august 28 .
in his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , sarrazin claims that members of germany 's muslim community pose a danger to german society . sarrazin , a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and berlin 's former finance chief , was reported in june as saying that members of the turkish and arab community were making germany " more stupid . "
with his book , kolat said , sarrazin had overstepped a boundary .
" it is the climax of a new intellectual racism and it damages germany 's reputation abroad , " kolat said .
high birth-rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says that his book is addressing cultural division in a serialization of the forthcoming book in the german popular daily newspaper bild , sarrazin said that germany 's muslim community had profited from social welfare payments far more than they contributed , and that higher birth-rates among immigrants could lead to the muslim population overtaking the " indigenous " one in terms of numbers .
merkel 's chief spokesman steffen seibert said on wednesday that many people would find the remarks " offensive " and " defamatory , " adding that the chancellor was concerned .
members of the spd have distanced themselves from sarrazin 's comments , while germany 's green and left parties have called for his removal from the central bank 's board .
a bundesbank spokesman said that sarrazin 's latest remarks were personal opinions , unconnected with his role on the board .
blanket generalizations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first female muslim minister said the comments lacked respect lower saxony 's minister of social affairs , ayguel oezkan , germany 's first-ever female muslim minister , accused sarrazin of doing damage to the muslim community with blanket generalizations .
" there are a vast number of hard-working immigrants , " she told the weekly german newspaper bild am sonntag ahead of its publication on sunday .
" they deserve respect , not malice . "
" all of those who are involved in society , those who encourage their children , who learn german , who work and pay taxes and those who , as entrepreneurs , provide jobs – all of them deserve respect . "
in june , 65-year-old sarrazin was reported as saying that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because immigrants were poorly educated .
' distorted image , half-truths ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin claims german society is being undermined by the muslim community maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , accused sarrazin of giving " a distorted image of integration in germany " that did not bear up to academic scrutiny .
" in his comments , he states only half truths , " she told bild am sonntag .
" it is indisputable that , in education , there are currently a lot of immigrants with a lot of catching up to do .
it does not take sarrazin 's comments to establish that . "
in a lengthy interview with weekly newspaper die zeit , sarrazin defended himself against the charge he was encouraging racism .
" i am not a racist , " he told the newspaper .
" the book addresses cultural divisions , not ethnic ones . "
last year , sarrazin caused a storm by claiming that most of berlin 's arab and turkish immigrants had no useful function " apart from fruit and vegetable trading . "
as a result , the central bank stripped sarrazin of some of his duties .

at the same time gruebe affirmed that the project would go ahead , saying that legislation has been passed and contracts issued . " let 's sit down at the table and talk about things - especially the facts , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster swr , adding that pr surrounding the construction project had gone " very , very badly . " bahn wo n't delay construction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project opponents overran construction site this week gruebe added that the bahn would not submit to demands to halt construction during the discussions .
axel wieland , spokesperson for one of the groups organizing the demonstrations , said it would amount to little more than a diversionary tactic to hold talks while maintaining the construction schedule . " you ca n't have a nice conversation with us while the construction work keeps chugging along , " he told the afp news agency . protesters have picketed the building site at stuttgart 's main station for weeks .
only a small core of demonstrators was at the site saturday as work continued demolishing one wing of the station .
police counted 30,000 people friday at a protest vigil outside the state parliament in stuttgart .
the protest movement claimed 50,000 .
the protesters said they expect about 10,000 people to come to another demonstration on monday . the protesters have criticized that the costs for the project have grown from 7 billions euros to 11 billion .
proponents , however , have pointed out that work for the new train station has created 4,000 jobs , and shorter travel times that would help the environment as more people travel via rail instead of flying . only the station 's main section will remain when all the rail lines have been moved underground and the land above has been subdivided for buildings and a park . author : sean sinico -lrb- dpa / afp / ap -rrb- editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it will also make journey times faster , with the current terminus station being turned into a through-station , meaning trains will no longer have to reverse out . stuttgart police estimated the friday crowd at 10,000 . political fallout a survey published in the local stuttgarter nachrichten this week showed that 63 percent of the city 's residents are against the project , with just 26 percent in favor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the station 's north wing has already been demolished " these are n't radicals , it 's the people in the middle , " political scientist gero neugebauer told the reuters news agency .

it will also make journey times faster , with the current terminus station being turned into a through-station , meaning trains will no longer have to reverse out . stuttgart police estimated the friday crowd at 10,000 . political fallout a survey published in the local stuttgarter nachrichten this week showed that 63 percent of the city 's residents are against the project , with just 26 percent in favor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the station 's north wing has already been demolished " these are n't radicals , it 's the people in the middle , " political scientist gero neugebauer told the reuters news agency .

" it will turn into a big problem for merkel if the cdu lose baden-wuerttemberg , " neugebauer said .
polls have shown the opposition center-left social democrats and greens ahead of the cdu and free democrats , who also form the coalition with merkel on the federal level in berlin . the project , part funded by the european union , aims to make stuttgart part of one of the longest high-speed lines in europe , linking paris , strasbourg , munich , vienna , bratislava and budapest . author : joanna impey -lrb- afp / ap / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it will also make journey times faster , with the current terminus station being turned into a through-station , meaning trains will no longer have to reverse out . stuttgart police estimated the friday crowd at 10,000 . political fallout a survey published in the local stuttgarter nachrichten this week showed that 63 percent of the city 's residents are against the project , with just 26 percent in favor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the station 's north wing has already been demolished " these are n't radicals , it 's the people in the middle , " political scientist gero neugebauer told the reuters news agency .

her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have ruled the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg since 1953 , but face an uphill struggle to hold onto power in the upcoming elections in march 2011 . " it will turn into a big problem for merkel if the cdu lose baden-wuerttemberg , " neugebauer said .
polls have shown the opposition center-left social democrats and greens ahead of the cdu and free democrats , who also form the coalition with merkel on the federal level in berlin . the project , part funded by the european union , aims to make stuttgart part of one of the longest high-speed lines in europe , linking paris , strasbourg , munich , vienna , bratislava and budapest . author : joanna impey -lrb- afp / ap / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

half of the city 's historic railway station is being torn down so construction can begin . the german rail company , deutsche bahn , is paying only a fraction of the cost .
its chief , ruediger grube , issued an invitation late friday to the anti-project coalition to meet for roundtable talks next month . " we have to act like grown-ups , " he said .
at the same time gruebe affirmed that the project would go ahead , saying that legislation has been passed and contracts issued . " let 's sit down at the table and talk about things - especially the facts , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster swr , adding that pr surrounding the construction project had gone " very , very badly . " bahn wo n't delay construction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project opponents overran construction site this week gruebe added that the bahn would not submit to demands to halt construction during the discussions .
axel wieland , spokesperson for one of the groups organizing the demonstrations , said it would amount to little more than a diversionary tactic to hold talks while maintaining the construction schedule . " you ca n't have a nice conversation with us while the construction work keeps chugging along , " he told the afp news agency . protesters have picketed the building site at stuttgart 's main station for weeks .
only a small core of demonstrators was at the site saturday as work continued demolishing one wing of the station .
police counted 30,000 people friday at a protest vigil outside the state parliament in stuttgart .
the protest movement claimed 50,000 .
the protesters said they expect about 10,000 people to come to another demonstration on monday . the protesters have criticized that the costs for the project have grown from 7 billions euros to 11 billion .
proponents , however , have pointed out that work for the new train station has created 4,000 jobs , and shorter travel times that would help the environment as more people travel via rail instead of flying . only the station 's main section will remain when all the rail lines have been moved underground and the land above has been subdivided for buildings and a park . author : sean sinico -lrb- dpa / afp / ap -rrb- editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kolat called on the government to act to remove sarrazin " i am calling upon the government to begin a procedure to remove thilo sarrazin from the board of the central bank , " kolat told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday , august 28 .
in his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , sarrazin claims that members of germany 's muslim community pose a danger to german society . sarrazin , a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and berlin 's former finance chief , was reported in june as saying that members of the turkish and arab community were making germany " more stupid .

merkel 's chief spokesman steffen seibert said on wednesday that many people would find the remarks " offensive " and " defamatory , " adding that the chancellor was concerned .
members of the spd have distanced themselves from sarrazin 's comments , while germany 's green and left parties have called for his removal from the central bank 's board .
a bundesbank spokesman said that sarrazin 's latest remarks were personal opinions , unconnected with his role on the board .

" they deserve respect , not malice . "
" all of those who are involved in society , those who encourage their children , who learn german , who work and pay taxes and those who , as entrepreneurs , provide jobs – all of them deserve respect . "
in june , 65-year-old sarrazin was reported as saying that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because immigrants were poorly educated .
' distorted image , half-truths ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin claims german society is being undermined by the muslim community maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , accused sarrazin of giving " a distorted image of integration in germany " that did not bear up to academic scrutiny .

" it is indisputable that , in education , there are currently a lot of immigrants with a lot of catching up to do .

" i am not a racist , " he told the newspaper .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kolat called on the government to act to remove sarrazin " i am calling upon the government to begin a procedure to remove thilo sarrazin from the board of the central bank , " kolat told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday , august 28 .
in his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , sarrazin claims that members of germany 's muslim community pose a danger to german society . sarrazin , a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and berlin 's former finance chief , was reported in june as saying that members of the turkish and arab community were making germany " more stupid . "
with his book , kolat said , sarrazin had overstepped a boundary .
" it is the climax of a new intellectual racism and it damages germany 's reputation abroad , " kolat said .
high birth-rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says that his book is addressing cultural division in a serialization of the forthcoming book in the german popular daily newspaper bild , sarrazin said that germany 's muslim community had profited from social welfare payments far more than they contributed , and that higher birth-rates among immigrants could lead to the muslim population overtaking the " indigenous " one in terms of numbers .
merkel 's chief spokesman steffen seibert said on wednesday that many people would find the remarks " offensive " and " defamatory , " adding that the chancellor was concerned .
members of the spd have distanced themselves from sarrazin 's comments , while germany 's green and left parties have called for his removal from the central bank 's board .
a bundesbank spokesman said that sarrazin 's latest remarks were personal opinions , unconnected with his role on the board .
blanket generalizations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first female muslim minister said the comments lacked respect lower saxony 's minister of social affairs , ayguel oezkan , germany 's first-ever female muslim minister , accused sarrazin of doing damage to the muslim community with blanket generalizations .
" there are a vast number of hard-working immigrants , " she told the weekly german newspaper bild am sonntag ahead of its publication on sunday .
" they deserve respect , not malice . "
" all of those who are involved in society , those who encourage their children , who learn german , who work and pay taxes and those who , as entrepreneurs , provide jobs – all of them deserve respect . "
in june , 65-year-old sarrazin was reported as saying that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because immigrants were poorly educated .
' distorted image , half-truths ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin claims german society is being undermined by the muslim community maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , accused sarrazin of giving " a distorted image of integration in germany " that did not bear up to academic scrutiny .
" in his comments , he states only half truths , " she told bild am sonntag .
" it is indisputable that , in education , there are currently a lot of immigrants with a lot of catching up to do .
it does not take sarrazin 's comments to establish that . "
in a lengthy interview with weekly newspaper die zeit , sarrazin defended himself against the charge he was encouraging racism .
" i am not a racist , " he told the newspaper .
" the book addresses cultural divisions , not ethnic ones . "
last year , sarrazin caused a storm by claiming that most of berlin 's arab and turkish immigrants had no useful function " apart from fruit and vegetable trading . "
as a result , the central bank stripped sarrazin of some of his duties .

half of the city 's historic railway station is being torn down so construction can begin . the german rail company , deutsche bahn , is paying only a fraction of the cost .
its chief , ruediger grube , issued an invitation late friday to the anti-project coalition to meet for roundtable talks next month . " we have to act like grown-ups , " he said .
at the same time gruebe affirmed that the project would go ahead , saying that legislation has been passed and contracts issued .

" bahn wo n't delay construction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project opponents overran construction site this week gruebe added that the bahn would not submit to demands to halt construction during the discussions .
axel wieland , spokesperson for one of the groups organizing the demonstrations , said it would amount to little more than a diversionary tactic to hold talks while maintaining the construction schedule . " you ca n't have a nice conversation with us while the construction work keeps chugging along , " he told the afp news agency . protesters have picketed the building site at stuttgart 's main station for weeks .
only a small core of demonstrators was at the site saturday as work continued demolishing one wing of the station .
police counted 30,000 people friday at a protest vigil outside the state parliament in stuttgart .
the protest movement claimed 50,000 .
the protesters said they expect about 10,000 people to come to another demonstration on monday . the protesters have criticized that the costs for the project have grown from 7 billions euros to 11 billion .
proponents , however , have pointed out that work for the new train station has created 4,000 jobs , and shorter travel times that would help the environment as more people travel via rail instead of flying . only the station 's main section will remain when all the rail lines have been moved underground and the land above has been subdivided for buildings and a park . author : sean sinico -lrb- dpa / afp / ap -rrb- editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

half of the city 's historic railway station is being torn down so construction can begin . the german rail company , deutsche bahn , is paying only a fraction of the cost .
its chief , ruediger grube , issued an invitation late friday to the anti-project coalition to meet for roundtable talks next month . " we have to act like grown-ups , " he said .
at the same time gruebe affirmed that the project would go ahead , saying that legislation has been passed and contracts issued . " let 's sit down at the table and talk about things - especially the facts , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster swr , adding that pr surrounding the construction project had gone " very , very badly . " bahn wo n't delay construction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project opponents overran construction site this week gruebe added that the bahn would not submit to demands to halt construction during the discussions .
axel wieland , spokesperson for one of the groups organizing the demonstrations , said it would amount to little more than a diversionary tactic to hold talks while maintaining the construction schedule . " you ca n't have a nice conversation with us while the construction work keeps chugging along , " he told the afp news agency . protesters have picketed the building site at stuttgart 's main station for weeks .
only a small core of demonstrators was at the site saturday as work continued demolishing one wing of the station .
police counted 30,000 people friday at a protest vigil outside the state parliament in stuttgart .
the protest movement claimed 50,000 .
the protesters said they expect about 10,000 people to come to another demonstration on monday . the protesters have criticized that the costs for the project have grown from 7 billions euros to 11 billion .
proponents , however , have pointed out that work for the new train station has created 4,000 jobs , and shorter travel times that would help the environment as more people travel via rail instead of flying . only the station 's main section will remain when all the rail lines have been moved underground and the land above has been subdivided for buildings and a park . author : sean sinico -lrb- dpa / afp / ap -rrb- editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" serbia will never recognize kosovo .
that is a red line that we will not cross , " he said , adding that he had given that message to german foreign minister guido westerwelle , us secretary of state hilary clinton , french president nicolas sarkozy , german chancellor angela merkel and that he was willing to " tell that to all . " westerwelle had this week called on the serbian government to accept the loss of its former ethnic-albanian province , which has been recognized as an independent state by 69 countries , including the united states and most eu member-states . he also said that all european union members should recognize kosovo as an independent state . author : darren mara -lrb- afp / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kolat called on the government to act to remove sarrazin " i am calling upon the government to begin a procedure to remove thilo sarrazin from the board of the central bank , " kolat told the german daily newspaper frankfurter rundschau on saturday , august 28 .
in his book " deutschland schafft sich ab " -lrb- " germany does away with itself " -rrb- , sarrazin claims that members of germany 's muslim community pose a danger to german society . sarrazin , a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and berlin 's former finance chief , was reported in june as saying that members of the turkish and arab community were making germany " more stupid . "
with his book , kolat said , sarrazin had overstepped a boundary .
" it is the climax of a new intellectual racism and it damages germany 's reputation abroad , " kolat said .
high birth-rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin says that his book is addressing cultural division in a serialization of the forthcoming book in the german popular daily newspaper bild , sarrazin said that germany 's muslim community had profited from social welfare payments far more than they contributed , and that higher birth-rates among immigrants could lead to the muslim population overtaking the " indigenous " one in terms of numbers .
merkel 's chief spokesman steffen seibert said on wednesday that many people would find the remarks " offensive " and " defamatory , " adding that the chancellor was concerned .
members of the spd have distanced themselves from sarrazin 's comments , while germany 's green and left parties have called for his removal from the central bank 's board .
a bundesbank spokesman said that sarrazin 's latest remarks were personal opinions , unconnected with his role on the board .
blanket generalizations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first female muslim minister said the comments lacked respect lower saxony 's minister of social affairs , ayguel oezkan , germany 's first-ever female muslim minister , accused sarrazin of doing damage to the muslim community with blanket generalizations .
" there are a vast number of hard-working immigrants , " she told the weekly german newspaper bild am sonntag ahead of its publication on sunday .
" they deserve respect , not malice . "
" all of those who are involved in society , those who encourage their children , who learn german , who work and pay taxes and those who , as entrepreneurs , provide jobs – all of them deserve respect . "
in june , 65-year-old sarrazin was reported as saying that germany was " becoming on average more stupid " because immigrants were poorly educated .
' distorted image , half-truths ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarrazin claims german society is being undermined by the muslim community maria boehmer , the government 's commissioner for integration , accused sarrazin of giving " a distorted image of integration in germany " that did not bear up to academic scrutiny .
" in his comments , he states only half truths , " she told bild am sonntag .
" it is indisputable that , in education , there are currently a lot of immigrants with a lot of catching up to do .
it does not take sarrazin 's comments to establish that . "
in a lengthy interview with weekly newspaper die zeit , sarrazin defended himself against the charge he was encouraging racism .
" i am not a racist , " he told the newspaper .
" the book addresses cultural divisions , not ethnic ones . "
last year , sarrazin caused a storm by claiming that most of berlin 's arab and turkish immigrants had no useful function " apart from fruit and vegetable trading . "
as a result , the central bank stripped sarrazin of some of his duties .

" we have assembled the facts , everything we could see , and noted it all down exactly , " he said .
" we are going to publish the complete video files on a web site .

everyone should get their own impression of what happened . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaller , right , says someone must take moral responsibility for the tragedy " the cordons led to a stoppage and were probably the cause of the disaster , " he said .
" to our minds , the question is why the police did this . " the north rhine-westphalia interior ministry denied that police played a role in causing the lethal mass panic . " the event 's organizer asked for police assistance because his security concept fell apart , " police inspector dieter wehe told reporters saturday .
" he had agreed to close the entrance gates .
that did not happen . " according to german mass-market daily bild , the videos are scheduled to be released early next week . blame game police and duisburg officials lined up against the love parade organizers in the days and weeks following the stampede in an effort to deflect blame for the incident . despite being at the center of the storm , schaller said " moral responsibility " for the stampede must eventually be assigned . " i was the organizer and these people would not have died if this event had not taken place , " he said .
" who is actually to blame must be established by the legal system .
obviously i will face up to responsibility . " author : darren mara -lrb- dpa / afp -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

half of the city 's historic railway station is being torn down so construction can begin . the german rail company , deutsche bahn , is paying only a fraction of the cost .
its chief , ruediger grube , issued an invitation late friday to the anti-project coalition to meet for roundtable talks next month . " we have to act like grown-ups , " he said .
at the same time gruebe affirmed that the project would go ahead , saying that legislation has been passed and contracts issued . " let 's sit down at the table and talk about things - especially the facts , " he said in an interview with german public broadcaster swr , adding that pr surrounding the construction project had gone " very , very badly . " bahn wo n't delay construction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project opponents overran construction site this week gruebe added that the bahn would not submit to demands to halt construction during the discussions .
axel wieland , spokesperson for one of the groups organizing the demonstrations , said it would amount to little more than a diversionary tactic to hold talks while maintaining the construction schedule . " you ca n't have a nice conversation with us while the construction work keeps chugging along , " he told the afp news agency . protesters have picketed the building site at stuttgart 's main station for weeks .
only a small core of demonstrators was at the site saturday as work continued demolishing one wing of the station .
police counted 30,000 people friday at a protest vigil outside the state parliament in stuttgart .
the protest movement claimed 50,000 .
the protesters said they expect about 10,000 people to come to another demonstration on monday . the protesters have criticized that the costs for the project have grown from 7 billions euros to 11 billion .
proponents , however , have pointed out that work for the new train station has created 4,000 jobs , and shorter travel times that would help the environment as more people travel via rail instead of flying . only the station 's main section will remain when all the rail lines have been moved underground and the land above has been subdivided for buildings and a park . author : sean sinico -lrb- dpa / afp / ap -rrb- editor : darren mara send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it will also make journey times faster , with the current terminus station being turned into a through-station , meaning trains will no longer have to reverse out . stuttgart police estimated the friday crowd at 10,000 . political fallout a survey published in the local stuttgarter nachrichten this week showed that 63 percent of the city 's residents are against the project , with just 26 percent in favor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the station 's north wing has already been demolished " these are n't radicals , it 's the people in the middle , " political scientist gero neugebauer told the reuters news agency .
" it should make the main political parties think twice .
they always say they want people to stand up and be counted but now they 're standing up and the leaders are turning a deaf ear . " the opposition to the stuttgart rail station project could have an impact on chancellor angela merkel 's government .
her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have ruled the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg since 1953 , but face an uphill struggle to hold onto power in the upcoming elections in march 2011 . " it will turn into a big problem for merkel if the cdu lose baden-wuerttemberg , " neugebauer said .
polls have shown the opposition center-left social democrats and greens ahead of the cdu and free democrats , who also form the coalition with merkel on the federal level in berlin . the project , part funded by the european union , aims to make stuttgart part of one of the longest high-speed lines in europe , linking paris , strasbourg , munich , vienna , bratislava and budapest . author : joanna impey -lrb- afp / ap / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it will also make journey times faster , with the current terminus station being turned into a through-station , meaning trains will no longer have to reverse out . stuttgart police estimated the friday crowd at 10,000 . political fallout a survey published in the local stuttgarter nachrichten this week showed that 63 percent of the city 's residents are against the project , with just 26 percent in favor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : part of the station 's north wing has already been demolished " these are n't radicals , it 's the people in the middle , " political scientist gero neugebauer told the reuters news agency .
" it should make the main political parties think twice .
they always say they want people to stand up and be counted but now they 're standing up and the leaders are turning a deaf ear . " the opposition to the stuttgart rail station project could have an impact on chancellor angela merkel 's government .
her christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have ruled the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg since 1953 , but face an uphill struggle to hold onto power in the upcoming elections in march 2011 . " it will turn into a big problem for merkel if the cdu lose baden-wuerttemberg , " neugebauer said .
polls have shown the opposition center-left social democrats and greens ahead of the cdu and free democrats , who also form the coalition with merkel on the federal level in berlin . the project , part funded by the european union , aims to make stuttgart part of one of the longest high-speed lines in europe , linking paris , strasbourg , munich , vienna , bratislava and budapest . author : joanna impey -lrb- afp / ap / reuters -rrb- editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he shared his thoughts with deutsche welle on the character of siegfried and performing at the celebrated festival . canadian lance ryan , who resides in karlsruhe , germany , first performed in germany in 2005 as " otello " at the staedtische buehnen muenster .
he 's sung at opera houses around the world , including at the vienna state opera and the frankfurt opera house .
a german opera magazine called him " sensational " in his role as siegfried in richard wagner 's opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung . " the 2010 bayreuth festival draws to a close on saturday , august 28 . deutsche welle : what path led to bayreuth for you ? lance ryan : i think it began with debuting the role of siegfried and initially having some success ; the word started to spread .
from what i understand , -lsb- bayreuth festival co-director -rsb- eva wagner-pasquier first heard me in stuttgart in " the flying dutchman , " and then she came to hear me once again in mulhouse when we were doing " siegfried . "
she really liked what she heard , and , at that point , a dialogue started to open between her and my agent . i think in september she first said they thought they needed a new siegfried for this coming summer .
it was short notice in operatic terms - 11 months - but i had the summer free , and i thought , " why not ? "
at that point , i also felt i owed something to frau wagner for spreading the good word about me and helping to propel me . on stage , you appear very natural in the role of siegfried .
do you feel natural despite the rather artificial situation of performing and singing at this energy level ? i think you have to find the enthusiasm , the energy and the youthfulness in siegfried .
there are many different aspects to the character , and that 's one of the reasons he 's fascinating to play .
you think back to being around 17 or 18 - the age siegfried is supposed to be - in that rebellious phase where you 're growing , and you want to get out and discover , but you really have no idea what you 're getting into .
that 's exactly what siegfried is .
once you kind of identify with that , everything else comes with it . it 's strange with wagner - it never strikes you right away what a great musician he is because the work is just so complex .
it 's so rich and dense that you have to sift through much material in order to find how he makes it work in such a genius way .
once you 've recognized all that , then you find the road , and it carries you .
in that way , it eventually does come naturally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryan said the bayreuth stage opens up possibilities unavailable elsewhere there 's certainly a heroic aspect to the music , and wagner said siegfried was his ultimate hero even though the character is adolescent and foolish .
why would siegfried be considered a hero ? it 's a great comparison when you take siegfried and siegmund , siegfried 's father .
siegmund had his father there to guide and teach him how to hunt and fight and deal with certain situations , but siegfried did n't have that .
he only had mime , this dwarf who never really loved him .
so i think one of the great tragedies in the work is that siegfried is a kind of dysfunctional character .
you have this boy with great potential but who is just born in tragic circumstances . i tend to think that wagner could identify that with his own history .
he recognized in himself what a great musician , dramatist and talent he was .
but early in his career , that was never recognized .
i think this inability to fulfill oneself in one 's youth is something he identified with , so maybe that 's why he feels siegfried was his greatest hero . i think that 's also one of the great lessons of the ring - to show what love really means and to show what can go wrong if it 's not nurtured between people . i imagine there is now a lot of demand for you to sing in new productions .
what priorities do you have musically ?
yes , there 's a lot of demand , and i have quite a few productions in view within the next five or six years .
but at the same time , i always want to keep a more lyrical side to the roles .
in the market , once you have a stamp or an identity , that 's what the theaters want because they want to say , " we have this singer in this role . "
it 's a marketing thing , and that 's just the way it is in modern society .
there 's a commercial aspect to it all now , in contrast to 100 years ago when there was more patronage . but i try to keep a balance for my vocal health and for artistic reasons .
i look for variety - something new and something lighter for my voice .
siegfried is good for my voice because the part is n't so deep .
its register still lies quite high , unlike tristan or parsifal .
with siegfried , you can keep the very tenor aspects , and when you do , i think the more heroic qualities come out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva wagner-pasquier -lrb- right -rrb- noticed ryan 's talent and helped recruit him for bayreuth how would you describe your first experience performing on the wagner stage ? it 's great - an amazing theater with an amazing acoustic .
i think the biggest difference for me was the way the orchestra pit is divided .
as a singer on stage , you hear the violins very clearly , but you do n't hear the horns and woodwinds as well as you normally would .
so , you have a different sound from the orchestra as an artist on stage , and you have to take note of that . other than that , the acoustic here gives you great confidence that you can do more vocally and artistically with color because you know the audience can almost always hear you .
like conductor christian thielemann has said , " you do n't have to sing so loud , we will adjust . "
that 's excellent to hear a conductor say that .
then you know you can play vocally - with lightness and color - and you do n't have to think " can the audience hear me ? " with this conductor and this stage , you feel that you can do things that you might not be able to do anywhere else .

once you kind of identify with that , everything else comes with it . it 's strange with wagner - it never strikes you right away what a great musician he is because the work is just so complex .
it 's so rich and dense that you have to sift through much material in order to find how he makes it work in such a genius way .
once you 've recognized all that , then you find the road , and it carries you .
in that way , it eventually does come naturally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ryan said the bayreuth stage opens up possibilities unavailable elsewhere there 's certainly a heroic aspect to the music , and wagner said siegfried was his ultimate hero even though the character is adolescent and foolish .
why would siegfried be considered a hero ? it 's a great comparison when you take siegfried and siegmund , siegfried 's father .
siegmund had his father there to guide and teach him how to hunt and fight and deal with certain situations , but siegfried did n't have that .
he only had mime , this dwarf who never really loved him .
so i think one of the great tragedies in the work is that siegfried is a kind of dysfunctional character .
you have this boy with great potential but who is just born in tragic circumstances . i tend to think that wagner could identify that with his own history .
he recognized in himself what a great musician , dramatist and talent he was .
but early in his career , that was never recognized .
i think this inability to fulfill oneself in one 's youth is something he identified with , so maybe that 's why he feels siegfried was his greatest hero . i think that 's also one of the great lessons of the ring - to show what love really means and to show what can go wrong if it 's not nurtured between people . i imagine there is now a lot of demand for you to sing in new productions .
what priorities do you have musically ?
yes , there 's a lot of demand , and i have quite a few productions in view within the next five or six years .
but at the same time , i always want to keep a more lyrical side to the roles .
in the market , once you have a stamp or an identity , that 's what the theaters want because they want to say , " we have this singer in this role . "
it 's a marketing thing , and that 's just the way it is in modern society .
there 's a commercial aspect to it all now , in contrast to 100 years ago when there was more patronage . but i try to keep a balance for my vocal health and for artistic reasons .
i look for variety - something new and something lighter for my voice .
siegfried is good for my voice because the part is n't so deep .
its register still lies quite high , unlike tristan or parsifal .
with siegfried , you can keep the very tenor aspects , and when you do , i think the more heroic qualities come out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva wagner-pasquier -lrb- right -rrb- noticed ryan 's talent and helped recruit him for bayreuth how would you describe your first experience performing on the wagner stage ? it 's great - an amazing theater with an amazing acoustic .
i think the biggest difference for me was the way the orchestra pit is divided .
as a singer on stage , you hear the violins very clearly , but you do n't hear the horns and woodwinds as well as you normally would .
so , you have a different sound from the orchestra as an artist on stage , and you have to take note of that . other than that , the acoustic here gives you great confidence that you can do more vocally and artistically with color because you know the audience can almost always hear you .
like conductor christian thielemann has said , " you do n't have to sing so loud , we will adjust . "
that 's excellent to hear a conductor say that .
then you know you can play vocally - with lightness and color - and you do n't have to think " can the audience hear me ? " with this conductor and this stage , you feel that you can do things that you might not be able to do anywhere else .

he shared his thoughts with deutsche welle on the character of siegfried and performing at the celebrated festival . canadian lance ryan , who resides in karlsruhe , germany , first performed in germany in 2005 as " otello " at the staedtische buehnen muenster .
he 's sung at opera houses around the world , including at the vienna state opera and the frankfurt opera house .
a german opera magazine called him " sensational " in his role as siegfried in richard wagner 's opera cycle " the ring of the nibelung . " the 2010 bayreuth festival draws to a close on saturday , august 28 . deutsche welle : what path led to bayreuth for you ? lance ryan : i think it began with debuting the role of siegfried and initially having some success ; the word started to spread .
from what i understand , -lsb- bayreuth festival co-director -rsb- eva wagner-pasquier first heard me in stuttgart in " the flying dutchman , " and then she came to hear me once again in mulhouse when we were doing " siegfried . "
she really liked what she heard , and , at that point , a dialogue started to open between her and my agent . i think in september she first said they thought they needed a new siegfried for this coming summer .
it was short notice in operatic terms - 11 months - but i had the summer free , and i thought , " why not ? "
at that point , i also felt i owed something to frau wagner for spreading the good word about me and helping to propel me . on stage , you appear very natural in the role of siegfried .
do you feel natural despite the rather artificial situation of performing and singing at this energy level ? i think you have to find the enthusiasm , the energy and the youthfulness in siegfried .
there are many different aspects to the character , and that 's one of the reasons he 's fascinating to play .

with siegfried , you can keep the very tenor aspects , and when you do , i think the more heroic qualities come out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva wagner-pasquier -lrb- right -rrb- noticed ryan 's talent and helped recruit him for bayreuth how would you describe your first experience performing on the wagner stage ? it 's great - an amazing theater with an amazing acoustic .
i think the biggest difference for me was the way the orchestra pit is divided .
as a singer on stage , you hear the violins very clearly , but you do n't hear the horns and woodwinds as well as you normally would .
so , you have a different sound from the orchestra as an artist on stage , and you have to take note of that . other than that , the acoustic here gives you great confidence that you can do more vocally and artistically with color because you know the audience can almost always hear you .
like conductor christian thielemann has said , " you do n't have to sing so loud , we will adjust . "
that 's excellent to hear a conductor say that .
then you know you can play vocally - with lightness and color - and you do n't have to think " can the audience hear me ? " with this conductor and this stage , you feel that you can do things that you might not be able to do anywhere else .
