once a hobby for miners , pigeon racing now attracts the wealthy . thousands of peeled eyes and pricked ears follow the coveted first lot as it 's brought to the auction block in dortmund 's expo center .
within a few minutes the bids reach 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,730 -rrb- , and then the item is " going once , going twice , going three times , sold . "
the crowd roars as the happy bidders step forward - to claim their new homing pigeon .
this hullabaloo is n't about quicker postal service .
the pigeon is for racing . twenty thousand pigeon fanciers visited dortmund 's annual homing pigeon fair and auction in the heart of the ruhr valley this year . although the former mining region is european capital of culture for 2010 , it is still richer in local color than high art .
case in point : the region is and remains germany 's pigeon-racing stronghold . pigeon sport is changing though , like the ruhr area itself . a whole new game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon-racing youth groups promote the sport in his half century of pigeon racing , dietmar schulz has seen the sport change considerably .
the 66-year-old retired locksmith from bochum remembers the days when 30 pigeon fanciers lived on his street .
now there are only three .
back then , in the summertime , the weekly release and return of the pigeons was the primary source of entertainment and bonding . " in the 40s , 50s and 60s , there were soccer clubs , pigeon clubs and rabbit clubs , " he recounted .
" that was it . " at the time of germany 's reunification in 1990 , well after pigeon racing 's heyday , there were still around 80,000 breeders in west germany alone .
today the german association of homing pigeon breeders estimates around 60,000 in all of germany . even so , the competition has become a good deal fiercer . dietmar schulz and his wife heike no longer bring home the big prizes .
they can not keep up with today 's wealthy breeders , some of whom can afford to buy single pigeons for the price of small houses and hire drivers to cart their birds hundreds of kilometers each day for training flights . the doctor is in with so much focus on success , it 's hard to tell what pigeon breeders love more : their pigeons or winning .
as head veterinarian at the pigeon clinic in essen - part of the extensive and evermore specialized homing-pigeon infrastructure - ludger kamphausen says the breeder-bird relationship plays a big role in his work . " there are those who see the pigeons as pets that they love , and others who are just interested in the birds ' performance , and who calculate every veterinary procedure as a financial investment , " he said . during the summer racing season , the clinic sees thousands of pigeons each day , as breeders try to figure out why their birds are n't winning .
in view of the amount of money invested in the hobby , it 's not surprising that the state-of-the-art clinic offers the kind of medical care unavailable to most humans . kamphausen 's colleague , elisabeth peus , has a simple explanation for why her costly veterinary services are in such demand . " the joy that breeders feel when their pigeons come home is what they invest so much in , " she says .
" i personally do n't have pigeons , because i 'd be too scared that they would n't come home ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money is no object for some pigeon racers the next generation christian nuesser does n't share dr. peus ' fear .
a fourth-generation pigeon racer from linnich , near the dutch border , nuesser is one of the few young people active in the sport .
at 16 , he spends two hours every weekday caring for his birds , and five hours a day on weekends .
" my dream , " he said , " is to get a few good pigeons which fly very quick and to be on the top of the charts . "
nuesser does n't know any pigeon breeders his own age .
what puts off other kids , he thinks , is the large time investment that 's necessary . indeed , attracting youth is the biggest challenge facing pigeon racing today , according to 23-year-old ruben hermans , president of the west european youth commission for pigeon sport . " it takes a few years to win prizes , and many young people do n't have the patience , " he said . yet there is a youth pigeon-racing scene , even if small .
hermans came to the fair in dortmund with several of his pigeon-buddies and had a hand in the youth section of the fair , which included games and even a young people 's pigeon auction . " the best pigeon experience is to make a lot of social contact with other people , " hermans said , " in pigeon sport there are lots of friends - also older people , also people from all over the world . " a complex love ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon breeding is usually a family activity back in bochum , the schulz family are trying their luck with a new flock .
their last flock of birds all ended in the saucepan - the fate of many racing pigeons who do n't make the grade . mr. schulz has high expectations of his birds ' performance but says that his love of pigeons and his desire to win are one and the same .
mrs. schulz , however , says that in the end it 's not just about winning . " when you have a stressful day or you 're depressed , you can come in here and sit down , " she said .
" the pigeons come to you and you can cuddle with them .
it makes you feel good . " while some of the sport 's newer , wealthier participants may come and go , the old guard is in the game for good .

in view of the amount of money invested in the hobby , it 's not surprising that the state-of-the-art clinic offers the kind of medical care unavailable to most humans . kamphausen 's colleague , elisabeth peus , has a simple explanation for why her costly veterinary services are in such demand . " the joy that breeders feel when their pigeons come home is what they invest so much in , " she says .
" i personally do n't have pigeons , because i 'd be too scared that they would n't come home ! "

a fourth-generation pigeon racer from linnich , near the dutch border , nuesser is one of the few young people active in the sport .
at 16 , he spends two hours every weekday caring for his birds , and five hours a day on weekends .
" my dream , " he said , " is to get a few good pigeons which fly very quick and to be on the top of the charts . "
nuesser does n't know any pigeon breeders his own age .
what puts off other kids , he thinks , is the large time investment that 's necessary . indeed , attracting youth is the biggest challenge facing pigeon racing today , according to 23-year-old ruben hermans , president of the west european youth commission for pigeon sport . " it takes a few years to win prizes , and many young people do n't have the patience , " he said . yet there is a youth pigeon-racing scene , even if small .
hermans came to the fair in dortmund with several of his pigeon-buddies and had a hand in the youth section of the fair , which included games and even a young people 's pigeon auction . " the best pigeon experience is to make a lot of social contact with other people , " hermans said , " in pigeon sport there are lots of friends - also older people , also people from all over the world . " a complex love ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon breeding is usually a family activity back in bochum , the schulz family are trying their luck with a new flock .

mrs. schulz , however , says that in the end it 's not just about winning . " when you have a stressful day or you 're depressed , you can come in here and sit down , " she said .

once a hobby for miners , pigeon racing now attracts the wealthy . thousands of peeled eyes and pricked ears follow the coveted first lot as it 's brought to the auction block in dortmund 's expo center .
within a few minutes the bids reach 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,730 -rrb- , and then the item is " going once , going twice , going three times , sold . "
the crowd roars as the happy bidders step forward - to claim their new homing pigeon .
this hullabaloo is n't about quicker postal service .
the pigeon is for racing . twenty thousand pigeon fanciers visited dortmund 's annual homing pigeon fair and auction in the heart of the ruhr valley this year . although the former mining region is european capital of culture for 2010 , it is still richer in local color than high art .
case in point : the region is and remains germany 's pigeon-racing stronghold . pigeon sport is changing though , like the ruhr area itself . a whole new game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon-racing youth groups promote the sport in his half century of pigeon racing , dietmar schulz has seen the sport change considerably .
the 66-year-old retired locksmith from bochum remembers the days when 30 pigeon fanciers lived on his street .
now there are only three .
back then , in the summertime , the weekly release and return of the pigeons was the primary source of entertainment and bonding . " in the 40s , 50s and 60s , there were soccer clubs , pigeon clubs and rabbit clubs , " he recounted .
" that was it . " at the time of germany 's reunification in 1990 , well after pigeon racing 's heyday , there were still around 80,000 breeders in west germany alone .
today the german association of homing pigeon breeders estimates around 60,000 in all of germany . even so , the competition has become a good deal fiercer . dietmar schulz and his wife heike no longer bring home the big prizes .
they can not keep up with today 's wealthy breeders , some of whom can afford to buy single pigeons for the price of small houses and hire drivers to cart their birds hundreds of kilometers each day for training flights . the doctor is in with so much focus on success , it 's hard to tell what pigeon breeders love more : their pigeons or winning .

once a hobby for miners , pigeon racing now attracts the wealthy . thousands of peeled eyes and pricked ears follow the coveted first lot as it 's brought to the auction block in dortmund 's expo center .
within a few minutes the bids reach 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,730 -rrb- , and then the item is " going once , going twice , going three times , sold . "
the crowd roars as the happy bidders step forward - to claim their new homing pigeon .
this hullabaloo is n't about quicker postal service .
the pigeon is for racing . twenty thousand pigeon fanciers visited dortmund 's annual homing pigeon fair and auction in the heart of the ruhr valley this year . although the former mining region is european capital of culture for 2010 , it is still richer in local color than high art .
case in point : the region is and remains germany 's pigeon-racing stronghold . pigeon sport is changing though , like the ruhr area itself . a whole new game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon-racing youth groups promote the sport in his half century of pigeon racing , dietmar schulz has seen the sport change considerably .
the 66-year-old retired locksmith from bochum remembers the days when 30 pigeon fanciers lived on his street .
now there are only three .
back then , in the summertime , the weekly release and return of the pigeons was the primary source of entertainment and bonding . " in the 40s , 50s and 60s , there were soccer clubs , pigeon clubs and rabbit clubs , " he recounted .
" that was it . " at the time of germany 's reunification in 1990 , well after pigeon racing 's heyday , there were still around 80,000 breeders in west germany alone .
today the german association of homing pigeon breeders estimates around 60,000 in all of germany . even so , the competition has become a good deal fiercer . dietmar schulz and his wife heike no longer bring home the big prizes .
they can not keep up with today 's wealthy breeders , some of whom can afford to buy single pigeons for the price of small houses and hire drivers to cart their birds hundreds of kilometers each day for training flights . the doctor is in with so much focus on success , it 's hard to tell what pigeon breeders love more : their pigeons or winning .
as head veterinarian at the pigeon clinic in essen - part of the extensive and evermore specialized homing-pigeon infrastructure - ludger kamphausen says the breeder-bird relationship plays a big role in his work . " there are those who see the pigeons as pets that they love , and others who are just interested in the birds ' performance , and who calculate every veterinary procedure as a financial investment , " he said . during the summer racing season , the clinic sees thousands of pigeons each day , as breeders try to figure out why their birds are n't winning .
in view of the amount of money invested in the hobby , it 's not surprising that the state-of-the-art clinic offers the kind of medical care unavailable to most humans . kamphausen 's colleague , elisabeth peus , has a simple explanation for why her costly veterinary services are in such demand . " the joy that breeders feel when their pigeons come home is what they invest so much in , " she says .
" i personally do n't have pigeons , because i 'd be too scared that they would n't come home ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money is no object for some pigeon racers the next generation christian nuesser does n't share dr. peus ' fear .
a fourth-generation pigeon racer from linnich , near the dutch border , nuesser is one of the few young people active in the sport .
at 16 , he spends two hours every weekday caring for his birds , and five hours a day on weekends .
" my dream , " he said , " is to get a few good pigeons which fly very quick and to be on the top of the charts . "
nuesser does n't know any pigeon breeders his own age .
what puts off other kids , he thinks , is the large time investment that 's necessary . indeed , attracting youth is the biggest challenge facing pigeon racing today , according to 23-year-old ruben hermans , president of the west european youth commission for pigeon sport . " it takes a few years to win prizes , and many young people do n't have the patience , " he said . yet there is a youth pigeon-racing scene , even if small .
hermans came to the fair in dortmund with several of his pigeon-buddies and had a hand in the youth section of the fair , which included games and even a young people 's pigeon auction . " the best pigeon experience is to make a lot of social contact with other people , " hermans said , " in pigeon sport there are lots of friends - also older people , also people from all over the world . " a complex love ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon breeding is usually a family activity back in bochum , the schulz family are trying their luck with a new flock .
their last flock of birds all ended in the saucepan - the fate of many racing pigeons who do n't make the grade . mr. schulz has high expectations of his birds ' performance but says that his love of pigeons and his desire to win are one and the same .
mrs. schulz , however , says that in the end it 's not just about winning . " when you have a stressful day or you 're depressed , you can come in here and sit down , " she said .
" the pigeons come to you and you can cuddle with them .
it makes you feel good . " while some of the sport 's newer , wealthier participants may come and go , the old guard is in the game for good .
prizes or no prizes , the schulzes say they will be raising and racing pigeons for as long as they 're still standing . author : david levitz editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

british elections last thursday resulted in a hung parliament , with neither of the major parties - center-left labour and the center-right conservatives - winning a majority in parliament .
nick clegg 's liberal democrat party came in third , allowing it to take on a kingmaker role for whichever of the major parties it chooses to form a coalition with .
the centrist lib dems spent the past three days holding coalition talks with the conservatives , led by david cameron .
brown 's announcement that he would " play no part " in the selection of the next labour leader came as a surprise .
brown said it was " in the interests of the whole country to form a progressive coalition government . "
" the reason we have a hung parliament is that no single party and no single leader was able to win the full support of the country , " brown said .
" as leader of my party , i must accept that that is a judgment on me . "
brown said he hoped that a new leader would be chosen before the party conference in september. svs / dpa / afp editor : send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

british elections last thursday resulted in a hung parliament , with neither of the major parties - center-left labour and the center-right conservatives - winning a majority in parliament .
nick clegg 's liberal democrat party came in third , allowing it to take on a kingmaker role for whichever of the major parties it chooses to form a coalition with .
the centrist lib dems spent the past three days holding coalition talks with the conservatives , led by david cameron .
brown 's announcement that he would " play no part " in the selection of the next labour leader came as a surprise .
brown said it was " in the interests of the whole country to form a progressive coalition government . "
" the reason we have a hung parliament is that no single party and no single leader was able to win the full support of the country , " brown said .
" as leader of my party , i must accept that that is a judgment on me . "

once a hobby for miners , pigeon racing now attracts the wealthy . thousands of peeled eyes and pricked ears follow the coveted first lot as it 's brought to the auction block in dortmund 's expo center .
within a few minutes the bids reach 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,730 -rrb- , and then the item is " going once , going twice , going three times , sold . "
the crowd roars as the happy bidders step forward - to claim their new homing pigeon .

the pigeon is for racing . twenty thousand pigeon fanciers visited dortmund 's annual homing pigeon fair and auction in the heart of the ruhr valley this year . although the former mining region is european capital of culture for 2010 , it is still richer in local color than high art .
case in point : the region is and remains germany 's pigeon-racing stronghold . pigeon sport is changing though , like the ruhr area itself . a whole new game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon-racing youth groups promote the sport in his half century of pigeon racing , dietmar schulz has seen the sport change considerably .
the 66-year-old retired locksmith from bochum remembers the days when 30 pigeon fanciers lived on his street .
now there are only three .
back then , in the summertime , the weekly release and return of the pigeons was the primary source of entertainment and bonding . " in the 40s , 50s and 60s , there were soccer clubs , pigeon clubs and rabbit clubs , " he recounted .
" that was it . " at the time of germany 's reunification in 1990 , well after pigeon racing 's heyday , there were still around 80,000 breeders in west germany alone .
today the german association of homing pigeon breeders estimates around 60,000 in all of germany . even so , the competition has become a good deal fiercer . dietmar schulz and his wife heike no longer bring home the big prizes .
they can not keep up with today 's wealthy breeders , some of whom can afford to buy single pigeons for the price of small houses and hire drivers to cart their birds hundreds of kilometers each day for training flights . the doctor is in with so much focus on success , it 's hard to tell what pigeon breeders love more : their pigeons or winning .
as head veterinarian at the pigeon clinic in essen - part of the extensive and evermore specialized homing-pigeon infrastructure - ludger kamphausen says the breeder-bird relationship plays a big role in his work . " there are those who see the pigeons as pets that they love , and others who are just interested in the birds ' performance , and who calculate every veterinary procedure as a financial investment , " he said . during the summer racing season , the clinic sees thousands of pigeons each day , as breeders try to figure out why their birds are n't winning .
in view of the amount of money invested in the hobby , it 's not surprising that the state-of-the-art clinic offers the kind of medical care unavailable to most humans . kamphausen 's colleague , elisabeth peus , has a simple explanation for why her costly veterinary services are in such demand . " the joy that breeders feel when their pigeons come home is what they invest so much in , " she says .
" i personally do n't have pigeons , because i 'd be too scared that they would n't come home ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money is no object for some pigeon racers the next generation christian nuesser does n't share dr. peus ' fear .
a fourth-generation pigeon racer from linnich , near the dutch border , nuesser is one of the few young people active in the sport .
at 16 , he spends two hours every weekday caring for his birds , and five hours a day on weekends .
" my dream , " he said , " is to get a few good pigeons which fly very quick and to be on the top of the charts . "
nuesser does n't know any pigeon breeders his own age .
what puts off other kids , he thinks , is the large time investment that 's necessary . indeed , attracting youth is the biggest challenge facing pigeon racing today , according to 23-year-old ruben hermans , president of the west european youth commission for pigeon sport . " it takes a few years to win prizes , and many young people do n't have the patience , " he said . yet there is a youth pigeon-racing scene , even if small .
hermans came to the fair in dortmund with several of his pigeon-buddies and had a hand in the youth section of the fair , which included games and even a young people 's pigeon auction . " the best pigeon experience is to make a lot of social contact with other people , " hermans said , " in pigeon sport there are lots of friends - also older people , also people from all over the world . " a complex love ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon breeding is usually a family activity back in bochum , the schulz family are trying their luck with a new flock .
their last flock of birds all ended in the saucepan - the fate of many racing pigeons who do n't make the grade . mr. schulz has high expectations of his birds ' performance but says that his love of pigeons and his desire to win are one and the same .
mrs. schulz , however , says that in the end it 's not just about winning . " when you have a stressful day or you 're depressed , you can come in here and sit down , " she said .
" the pigeons come to you and you can cuddle with them .
it makes you feel good . " while some of the sport 's newer , wealthier participants may come and go , the old guard is in the game for good .

the funds will be used to rescue any eurozone country that gets into serious financial difficulty . news of the proposed eurozone stability package saw markets rise worldwide on monday , which was just the sort of reaction that european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund had hoped for .
frankfurt 's dax closed the day up 5.3 percent , london 's ftse 100 index ended the day up 5.16 percent , while in paris , the cac-40 soared to close up by 9.66 percent .
in new york , the dow jones jumped by more than four percent in early trading .
the euro shot up by 1.5 cents against the us dollar after the announcement of the deal , then fell slightly to 1.28 dollars as the markets waited to see if member nations would follow through with austerity measures .
this followed a 14-month low against the dollar last week , amid uncertainty that the bloc would rescue greece , spain and portugal from possible default . the markets were reacting to an announcement made by european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund in brussels early on monday , that they had agreed on the creation of permanent measures worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 964 billion -rrb- to bail out eurozone states that run into financial difficulty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has already secured a 110 billion-euro loan package from the eurozone and the imf under the plan , the european commission is to provide 60 billion euros , while members of the 16-nation eurozone have pledged 440 billion euros to the fund .
the imf is to contribute an additional 250 billion euros , said spanish finance minister elena salgado .
german chancellor angela merkel said that the nearly trillion-dollar package would serve to " strengthen and protect " the euro .
she said that the eurozone must actively resolve its stability problem " at the roots " by pressing member states to balance their budgets .
" budget consolidation in all member states is extraordinarily important , " said merkel .
the chancellor also welcomed new austerity measures promised by the spanish government , saying they send an important message to the markets .
washington has praised europe 's stabilization plans . one white house official said president barack obama supports " assertive action " to address the greek debt crisis , and that european leaders have his support .
calming the markets the european commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , olli rehn , said the massive bailout " proves that we will defend the euro , whatever it takes . "
the european central bank will also implement exceptional measures in support of the package , the eu 's top economic official said on monday .
international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn hailed the package as a big step forward , and said the imf would be happy to contribute should eurozone countries require additional help from beyond the european central bank .
calming the fears of international markets appears to be the main goal of the package , but swedish finance minister anders borg described the situation more bluntly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets seem to approve of the eurozone measures " we now see herd behavior in the markets that is really pack behavior , wolf pack behavior , " borg told reporters .
" if we will not stop these packs , they will tear the weaker countries apart . "
meanwhile , britain 's chancellor of the exchequer , alistair darling , said the package was a " good deal " for europe , and that it was in the best interests of britain 's banks and export market .
however , darling did make it clear that this was a problem for the eurogroup .
" what we ca n't do is provide support for the euro , " said darling .
" that 's got to be for those countries that use the euro that are members of the eurogroup . "
awkward timing the euro stabilization deal comes just as state elections in germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , have taken away merkel 's majority in the upper house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disapproval of the greek bailout could have been one of the factors to the cdu 's majority loss the results of the election in north rhine-westphalia were seen by some as a reaction to merkel 's reluctant support of the eu 's greek bailout , which is unpopular with many voters in germany .
nevertheless , merkel stressed the measures were needed to protect the euro and german incomes .
" it is the first time in the history of the euro and the eu , and we are protecting our currency in an extraordinary situation , " said merkel .
" i can also put it this way to the population : we are protecting the money of the people in germany . "
the european commission is planning to meet on wednesday to determine how to strengthen eu budget rules and economic surveillance in the eurozone to avoid a future crisis. mk / gb / apf / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
gema , an organization that represents 60,000 german songwriters , composers , and music publishers , charges web and airwave broadcasters a fee each time they use a piece of music produced by one of their members .
it had been in negotiations with youtube owners google for the past year , trying to come up with a successor to their last contract , which expired on april 1 .
" we are not trying to punish youtube users , but we want to show google what we can do if we want to , " gema chief executive urban pappi said .
gema and its international partners represent the rights-holders for up to 60 percent of the world 's music .
it collects more than 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- in fees per year , from everything from doctor 's offices where music is played in waiting rooms to discos and radio stations .
google said it was " disappointed " by gema 's decision .
it said that if it paid the group 's asking price , it would lose money every time someone watched a clip by a professional musician .
" the more music videos that are released on youtube and the more popular these music videos become , the more money youtube can generate to be shared with rights holders and the songwriters they represent , " google said in a statement . svs / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the east asian nation has not only become one of sri lanka 's key trade partners and a major military ally , but it has helped the south asian country counter western pressure on issues such as human rights . it has been a year since sri lanka 's army secured victory over the tamil tiger rebels or ltte and the decades ' old civil war came to an end .
this would n't have become possible without the support of sri lanka 's key ally china , many in the south asian nation think .
" china helped the sri lankan state immensely with the war with the ltte when the sri lankan government needed assistance in terms of weapons and ammunition etc , " says si keethaponcalan , an expert from the university of colombo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sri lankan army received ammunition from china during the war diplomatic support the people 's republic 's support came on the diplomatic front as well .
when the west sharply criticized the sri lankan government 's handling of the conflict , particularly the final stages of the war , and the us stopped its military aid over human rights issues , beijing threw its weight behind colombo by blocking a resolution censuring sri lanka at the un security council .
after that the relations between the two traditional allies strengthened further . experts say the basis for the close bilateral ties between the two sides is the fact that china ’ s support to sri lanka is unconditional .
" unlike the western countries and organizations which impose conditions when they give us aid , whether it is the world bank or imf or bilateral aid , the chinese have been giving us aid without asking questions , " says kalyananda godage , a former sri lankan ambassador to the eu . countering india another major reason why sri lanka values this relationship is that china acts as a counterweight to its long-term ally india , says jehan perera , the executive director of the national peace council , a civil rights body in colombo : " india has had a major impact on sri lanka and has pressurized sri lanka in various ways in the past .
so sri lanka would like to have a counterweight of equal size and stature to india to balance it off , " says perera . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lankan gems are world renowned , especially its blue sapphires and cat 's eyes growing chinese investment with almost $ 1 billion in development aid , beijing surpassed tokyo as colombo 's largest foreign donor last year . the chinese are also building a massive port worth almost a billion us dollars in hambantota on sri lanka 's southeastern coast .
some western media have reported that china would like to use it as a naval base .
but the sri lankan government has insisted that the purpose of the port is purely commercial . " china has a huge navy . it is now an emerging superpower and its trade is huge with the west .
china needs energy supplies from the middle east .
and all of this passes via sri lanka because of our location in the indian ocean .
so that has become very important , " says former diplomat godage . exciting market the emerging superpower has also become an increasingly important trading partner for the sri lankans .
gems , jewelry , tea and natural rubber are areas where colombo sees potential for the bilateral trade to grow further . " it is a market that is going to mature , " says shezard careem , one of the leading gem traders in colombo .
" it is tremendously wealthy and a luxury market as well .
it provides a whole gamut of opportunities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of sri lankans follow buddhism human rights : an ' internal issue ' while china and its western partners have differences over issues such as human rights in china , many in sri lanka consider this as china 's internal matter . " we are not going to be concerned about china 's human rights record , they can look after that , " says godage .
" we are interested in a good mutually beneficial relationship which also looks after our security , economic and political interests .
so we are very happy with our relationship with china . " the urge to not to lose or upset this ' valuable ' partner is so huge that sri lanka , a predominantly buddhist country , even stopped two of its cricket players from meeting the dalai lama in india recently . author : disha uppal editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has shaped population curves all over the world , but not in china , where it ca n't seem to catch on . half a century ago , in the year 1960 , a birth control pill by the name of " evonid " went onto the market in the usa – today , 50 years later , the pill is one of the most important forms of contraception .
it is very popular in europe but in china , on the other hand , it is not so wide-spread .
the birth control pill is stocked on the shelves in every pharmacy in china - right next to nasal spray and pain relievers .
a month 's supply costs just over two euros .
people in china do not need a doctor 's prescription to buy it ; women who are interested just ask a pharmacist .
one woman in a pharmacy in beijing says , " i do n't know what different kinds of pills there are .
i buy the one that the pharmacist suggests - the one with the least amount of side-effects . "
sexual emancipation - in the west when the pill went on the market in the usa in 1960 , china was quick to follow .
a few years later the country came out with its own contraceptive pills .
in the west , the pill was celebrated as sexual emancipation for women , but in china it was seen as merely a new form of contraception that could help slow down the rapid growth of the population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many young chinese women use the pill for contraception one woman from beijing remembers how the government propagated the pill .
she says , " in the beginning , our work units handed out the pill to us .
you could just go there and get it for free . "
despite being promoted by the government , the pill was never really accepted as a universal form of contraceptive in china , neither in the cities , nor in the country .
according to official chinese statistics , merely two to three percent of chinese women take the pill .
and even those numbers are dwindling .
' throws the body off balance ' women in beijing say they do n't like the pill 's side-effects .
one woman says , " the good thing about the pill is that it makes your skin nice and reduces acne , but it is also unhealthy .
i have heard it can cause vascular diseases in women over 40 and it is also not good for the heart . "
another woman agrees : " i used to take it , but only seldom .
taking the pill is primitive ; there are too many side-effects and it can cause damage to the body .
it throws the body off balance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six women who did n't take the pill - these ladies flaunt their bumps for the 2008 olympics other methods of contraception are preferred in china , like the contraceptive coil , condoms and plain " being careful " .
but because the latter is far from fool-proof , abortions are also very common .
they are carried out in normal hospitals or in private and often illegal clinics , where prices are very low , as are hygienic standards .
in a regular hospital , an abortion costs around 100 euros and getting an appointment is never a problem .
the patients do not need a doctor 's approval , nor consultation .
more and more young women get abortions , some even get many ; there is no talk of the psychological impact abortions can have .
china is one-of-a-kind in this respect .
it is not likely that china will ever change its policy and promote the pill over abortions .
discussions about the moral implications of killing an unborn child do not officially take place .

the east asian nation has not only become one of sri lanka 's key trade partners and a major military ally , but it has helped the south asian country counter western pressure on issues such as human rights . it has been a year since sri lanka 's army secured victory over the tamil tiger rebels or ltte and the decades ' old civil war came to an end .
this would n't have become possible without the support of sri lanka 's key ally china , many in the south asian nation think .
" china helped the sri lankan state immensely with the war with the ltte when the sri lankan government needed assistance in terms of weapons and ammunition etc , " says si keethaponcalan , an expert from the university of colombo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sri lankan army received ammunition from china during the war diplomatic support the people 's republic 's support came on the diplomatic front as well .
when the west sharply criticized the sri lankan government 's handling of the conflict , particularly the final stages of the war , and the us stopped its military aid over human rights issues , beijing threw its weight behind colombo by blocking a resolution censuring sri lanka at the un security council .
after that the relations between the two traditional allies strengthened further . experts say the basis for the close bilateral ties between the two sides is the fact that china ’ s support to sri lanka is unconditional .
" unlike the western countries and organizations which impose conditions when they give us aid , whether it is the world bank or imf or bilateral aid , the chinese have been giving us aid without asking questions , " says kalyananda godage , a former sri lankan ambassador to the eu . countering india another major reason why sri lanka values this relationship is that china acts as a counterweight to its long-term ally india , says jehan perera , the executive director of the national peace council , a civil rights body in colombo : " india has had a major impact on sri lanka and has pressurized sri lanka in various ways in the past .
so sri lanka would like to have a counterweight of equal size and stature to india to balance it off , " says perera . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lankan gems are world renowned , especially its blue sapphires and cat 's eyes growing chinese investment with almost $ 1 billion in development aid , beijing surpassed tokyo as colombo 's largest foreign donor last year . the chinese are also building a massive port worth almost a billion us dollars in hambantota on sri lanka 's southeastern coast .
some western media have reported that china would like to use it as a naval base .
but the sri lankan government has insisted that the purpose of the port is purely commercial . " china has a huge navy . it is now an emerging superpower and its trade is huge with the west .
china needs energy supplies from the middle east .
and all of this passes via sri lanka because of our location in the indian ocean .
so that has become very important , " says former diplomat godage . exciting market the emerging superpower has also become an increasingly important trading partner for the sri lankans .
gems , jewelry , tea and natural rubber are areas where colombo sees potential for the bilateral trade to grow further . " it is a market that is going to mature , " says shezard careem , one of the leading gem traders in colombo .
" it is tremendously wealthy and a luxury market as well .
it provides a whole gamut of opportunities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of sri lankans follow buddhism human rights : an ' internal issue ' while china and its western partners have differences over issues such as human rights in china , many in sri lanka consider this as china 's internal matter . " we are not going to be concerned about china 's human rights record , they can look after that , " says godage .
" we are interested in a good mutually beneficial relationship which also looks after our security , economic and political interests .
so we are very happy with our relationship with china . " the urge to not to lose or upset this ' valuable ' partner is so huge that sri lanka , a predominantly buddhist country , even stopped two of its cricket players from meeting the dalai lama in india recently . author : disha uppal editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 10.05.2010 five years on , berlin holocaust memorial is a landmark of remembrance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin holocaust memorial was a long time in the making now five years old , berlin 's holocaust memorial serves as a landmark of remembrance and a symbol of collective conscience - even as the structure threatens to crumble .
dw looks at the memorial 's past , present and future . in 1953 - in the wake of the holocaust - a first order of business for the young israeli state was the construction of the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem .
forty years later , washington , d.c. built its holocaust memorial .
yet it was n't until 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii , that germany , the atrocity 's perpetrator , unveiled its memorial to the murdered jews of europe . it 's been five years since the holocaust memorial opened at the center of berlin .
support and appreciation for the monument - which caused 13 years of heated debate and may now be disintegrating - is stronger than ever . a grassroots proposal the idea for the memorial first came at the beginning of 1989 through a citizens ' initiative in berlin , spearheaded by journalist and publicist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
the group wanted to see a national memorial to the jews who perished in the holocaust built in berlin , which was the capital of east germany at the time . with the fall of the berlin wall a few months later and the excitement of germany 's reunification shortly thereafter , the idea was almost immediately placed on the backburner .
a few years later , in 1992 , chancellor helmut kohl 's government became proponents of the memorial 's construction and set aside space for it next to berlin 's brandenburg gate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect peter eisenman says he could n't have done it without rosh 's support in bonn , still the capital of west germany , many parliamentarians fought for the monument to be built .
among them was christian democrat norbert lammert , who is now head of the memorial 's curatorial committee . lammert says that he and several others " emphatically advocated that the government 's move to berlin after reunification needed to begin with such a demonstrative sign . " but the monument itself would not be realized for quite some time .
after rounds of hearings , debates , competitions and exhibitions , the german parliament finally decided to create a foundation to decide on and implement a design for the memorial . throughout this process and the further debates that ensued , the memorial 's conceptualists , rosh and jaeckel , remained clear on what they wanted their brainchild to accomplish .
" we wanted the memorial to do three things , " rosh told deutsche welle : " to commemorate what took place , to honor the victims and to give them back their names . " the fruits of a long labor today , the monument does just that .
spreading over 19,000 square meters -lrb- over 200,000 square feet -rrb- in the middle of berlin , the memorial to the murdered jews of europe is made up of 2,711 gray , concrete steles of varying heights - a seemingly endless landscape of concrete waves that ca n't be overlooked . some critics found the monument too abstract and anonymous , so an information center was later added beneath the terrain , where visitors can learn about the holocaust and its victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial , located at the heart of berlin , is facing serious renovation the monument 's designer , american architect peter eisenman , has not been back to the memorial since its opening in may 2005 , and was originally against the addition of the information center .
now , he is more pleased than ever with his work . " it 's unusual for an american to sit here and say , it was my intention to give you back your memory , " eisenman said .
" it sounds rather condescending , but i think if i had been german , i would have done it and perceived it in the same way . " it was n't an easy road for eisenman ; the memorial that was finally constructed was the second proposal , after the large-scale sculptor richard serra backed out of the project . " i 'm very proud of what we accomplished .
we encountered a great deal of disputes and setbacks .
but lea rosh kept us from giving up , and step by step we got there .
by now , those difficulties have faded into history .
now it 's about the present and the future . looking forward the monument 's future is not fully unproblematic .
recently , faulty construction has begun taking a toll on the concrete pillars , and renovation or partial reconstruction will soon become urgently necessary . uwe neumaerker , the director of the memorial foundation , told deutsche welle he does not know how long the process will take , adding that " tests have shown that unfortunately it will take a very long time . "
still , neumaerker assures that " nothing will fall apart . " more likely than the memorial 's concrete steles falling on visitors , it seems , is visitors falling off steles .
the monument has become a popular destination for games of hide-and-seek , parkour daredevils and sun-worshippers that come on warm days to enjoy the shade-free tops of the steles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial is sometimes used for other purposes rosh takes a relatively relaxed stance toward visitors repurposing her memorial . " sometimes i go and see people sunning themselves on the steles and tell them that there are lawns for sunbathing in the tiergarten just across the street , " she said .
" i tell the boys who are hopping around on the steles that they should do that somewhere else . " when i tell the eight- to 12-year-olds that they should go into the information center below the memorial and then come talk to me about it , it 's always very powerful .
they tell me they 've learned a lot . " author : marcel fuerstenau -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the site , near the kosovo border , was " more proof that serbia does not shy away from its dark past and is ready to bring to justice all those who have committed crimes , " said prosecutor vladimir vukcevic .
during the two-year conflict , serb forces controlled by former strongman slobodan milosevic transported the remains of hundreds of ethnic albanian civilians to several locations in serbia in a bid to cover up mass killings and war crimes .
in 2001 , the remains of more than 830 kosovo albanians were found at three sites in serbia .
over 700 bodies have since been uncovered in a mass grave located in a suburb of the capital , belgrade .
dozens more were found in the towns of petrovo selo and perucac .
the exhumation of bodies from the raska site is expected to begin soon when an evaluation of the crime scene is completed .
a former top police official and serbian deputy interior minister during the kosovo conflict , vlastimir djordjevic , is believed to have ordered the vast cover-up .
djordjevic is currently standing trial at the un war crimes tribunal in the hague. gb / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.05.2010 pigeon racing lives on in the european capital of culture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon sport costs a great deal of time and money most people consider pigeons a nuisance , but for some ruhr valley natives the birds are a way of life : a family activity , an obsession , even a profession .
once a hobby for miners , pigeon racing now attracts the wealthy . thousands of peeled eyes and pricked ears follow the coveted first lot as it 's brought to the auction block in dortmund 's expo center .
within a few minutes the bids reach 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,730 -rrb- , and then the item is " going once , going twice , going three times , sold . "
the crowd roars as the happy bidders step forward - to claim their new homing pigeon .
this hullabaloo is n't about quicker postal service .
the pigeon is for racing . twenty thousand pigeon fanciers visited dortmund 's annual homing pigeon fair and auction in the heart of the ruhr valley this year . although the former mining region is european capital of culture for 2010 , it is still richer in local color than high art .
case in point : the region is and remains germany 's pigeon-racing stronghold . pigeon sport is changing though , like the ruhr area itself . a whole new game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon-racing youth groups promote the sport in his half century of pigeon racing , dietmar schulz has seen the sport change considerably .
the 66-year-old retired locksmith from bochum remembers the days when 30 pigeon fanciers lived on his street .
now there are only three .
back then , in the summertime , the weekly release and return of the pigeons was the primary source of entertainment and bonding . " in the 40s , 50s and 60s , there were soccer clubs , pigeon clubs and rabbit clubs , " he recounted .
" that was it . " at the time of germany 's reunification in 1990 , well after pigeon racing 's heyday , there were still around 80,000 breeders in west germany alone .
today the german association of homing pigeon breeders estimates around 60,000 in all of germany . even so , the competition has become a good deal fiercer . dietmar schulz and his wife heike no longer bring home the big prizes .
they can not keep up with today 's wealthy breeders , some of whom can afford to buy single pigeons for the price of small houses and hire drivers to cart their birds hundreds of kilometers each day for training flights . the doctor is in with so much focus on success , it 's hard to tell what pigeon breeders love more : their pigeons or winning .
as head veterinarian at the pigeon clinic in essen - part of the extensive and evermore specialized homing-pigeon infrastructure - ludger kamphausen says the breeder-bird relationship plays a big role in his work . " there are those who see the pigeons as pets that they love , and others who are just interested in the birds ' performance , and who calculate every veterinary procedure as a financial investment , " he said . during the summer racing season , the clinic sees thousands of pigeons each day , as breeders try to figure out why their birds are n't winning .
in view of the amount of money invested in the hobby , it 's not surprising that the state-of-the-art clinic offers the kind of medical care unavailable to most humans . kamphausen 's colleague , elisabeth peus , has a simple explanation for why her costly veterinary services are in such demand . " the joy that breeders feel when their pigeons come home is what they invest so much in , " she says .
" i personally do n't have pigeons , because i 'd be too scared that they would n't come home ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money is no object for some pigeon racers the next generation christian nuesser does n't share dr. peus ' fear .
a fourth-generation pigeon racer from linnich , near the dutch border , nuesser is one of the few young people active in the sport .
at 16 , he spends two hours every weekday caring for his birds , and five hours a day on weekends .
" my dream , " he said , " is to get a few good pigeons which fly very quick and to be on the top of the charts . "
nuesser does n't know any pigeon breeders his own age .
what puts off other kids , he thinks , is the large time investment that 's necessary . indeed , attracting youth is the biggest challenge facing pigeon racing today , according to 23-year-old ruben hermans , president of the west european youth commission for pigeon sport . " it takes a few years to win prizes , and many young people do n't have the patience , " he said . yet there is a youth pigeon-racing scene , even if small .
hermans came to the fair in dortmund with several of his pigeon-buddies and had a hand in the youth section of the fair , which included games and even a young people 's pigeon auction . " the best pigeon experience is to make a lot of social contact with other people , " hermans said , " in pigeon sport there are lots of friends - also older people , also people from all over the world . " a complex love ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon breeding is usually a family activity back in bochum , the schulz family are trying their luck with a new flock .
their last flock of birds all ended in the saucepan - the fate of many racing pigeons who do n't make the grade . mr. schulz has high expectations of his birds ' performance but says that his love of pigeons and his desire to win are one and the same .
mrs. schulz , however , says that in the end it 's not just about winning . " when you have a stressful day or you 're depressed , you can come in here and sit down , " she said .
" the pigeons come to you and you can cuddle with them .
it makes you feel good . " while some of the sport 's newer , wealthier participants may come and go , the old guard is in the game for good .
prizes or no prizes , the schulzes say they will be raising and racing pigeons for as long as they 're still standing . author : david levitz editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the pigeon is for racing . twenty thousand pigeon fanciers visited dortmund 's annual homing pigeon fair and auction in the heart of the ruhr valley this year . although the former mining region is european capital of culture for 2010 , it is still richer in local color than high art .
case in point : the region is and remains germany 's pigeon-racing stronghold . pigeon sport is changing though , like the ruhr area itself . a whole new game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon-racing youth groups promote the sport in his half century of pigeon racing , dietmar schulz has seen the sport change considerably .
the 66-year-old retired locksmith from bochum remembers the days when 30 pigeon fanciers lived on his street .
now there are only three .
back then , in the summertime , the weekly release and return of the pigeons was the primary source of entertainment and bonding . " in the 40s , 50s and 60s , there were soccer clubs , pigeon clubs and rabbit clubs , " he recounted .
" that was it . " at the time of germany 's reunification in 1990 , well after pigeon racing 's heyday , there were still around 80,000 breeders in west germany alone .
today the german association of homing pigeon breeders estimates around 60,000 in all of germany . even so , the competition has become a good deal fiercer . dietmar schulz and his wife heike no longer bring home the big prizes .
they can not keep up with today 's wealthy breeders , some of whom can afford to buy single pigeons for the price of small houses and hire drivers to cart their birds hundreds of kilometers each day for training flights . the doctor is in with so much focus on success , it 's hard to tell what pigeon breeders love more : their pigeons or winning .
as head veterinarian at the pigeon clinic in essen - part of the extensive and evermore specialized homing-pigeon infrastructure - ludger kamphausen says the breeder-bird relationship plays a big role in his work . " there are those who see the pigeons as pets that they love , and others who are just interested in the birds ' performance , and who calculate every veterinary procedure as a financial investment , " he said . during the summer racing season , the clinic sees thousands of pigeons each day , as breeders try to figure out why their birds are n't winning .
in view of the amount of money invested in the hobby , it 's not surprising that the state-of-the-art clinic offers the kind of medical care unavailable to most humans . kamphausen 's colleague , elisabeth peus , has a simple explanation for why her costly veterinary services are in such demand . " the joy that breeders feel when their pigeons come home is what they invest so much in , " she says .
" i personally do n't have pigeons , because i 'd be too scared that they would n't come home ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money is no object for some pigeon racers the next generation christian nuesser does n't share dr. peus ' fear .
a fourth-generation pigeon racer from linnich , near the dutch border , nuesser is one of the few young people active in the sport .
at 16 , he spends two hours every weekday caring for his birds , and five hours a day on weekends .
" my dream , " he said , " is to get a few good pigeons which fly very quick and to be on the top of the charts . "
nuesser does n't know any pigeon breeders his own age .
what puts off other kids , he thinks , is the large time investment that 's necessary . indeed , attracting youth is the biggest challenge facing pigeon racing today , according to 23-year-old ruben hermans , president of the west european youth commission for pigeon sport . " it takes a few years to win prizes , and many young people do n't have the patience , " he said . yet there is a youth pigeon-racing scene , even if small .
hermans came to the fair in dortmund with several of his pigeon-buddies and had a hand in the youth section of the fair , which included games and even a young people 's pigeon auction . " the best pigeon experience is to make a lot of social contact with other people , " hermans said , " in pigeon sport there are lots of friends - also older people , also people from all over the world . " a complex love ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon breeding is usually a family activity back in bochum , the schulz family are trying their luck with a new flock .
their last flock of birds all ended in the saucepan - the fate of many racing pigeons who do n't make the grade . mr. schulz has high expectations of his birds ' performance but says that his love of pigeons and his desire to win are one and the same .
mrs. schulz , however , says that in the end it 's not just about winning . " when you have a stressful day or you 're depressed , you can come in here and sit down , " she said .
" the pigeons come to you and you can cuddle with them .
it makes you feel good . " while some of the sport 's newer , wealthier participants may come and go , the old guard is in the game for good .
prizes or no prizes , the schulzes say they will be raising and racing pigeons for as long as they 're still standing . author : david levitz editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

once a hobby for miners , pigeon racing now attracts the wealthy . thousands of peeled eyes and pricked ears follow the coveted first lot as it 's brought to the auction block in dortmund 's expo center .
within a few minutes the bids reach 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,730 -rrb- , and then the item is " going once , going twice , going three times , sold . "
the crowd roars as the happy bidders step forward - to claim their new homing pigeon .
this hullabaloo is n't about quicker postal service .
the pigeon is for racing . twenty thousand pigeon fanciers visited dortmund 's annual homing pigeon fair and auction in the heart of the ruhr valley this year . although the former mining region is european capital of culture for 2010 , it is still richer in local color than high art .
case in point : the region is and remains germany 's pigeon-racing stronghold . pigeon sport is changing though , like the ruhr area itself . a whole new game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon-racing youth groups promote the sport in his half century of pigeon racing , dietmar schulz has seen the sport change considerably .
the 66-year-old retired locksmith from bochum remembers the days when 30 pigeon fanciers lived on his street .
now there are only three .
back then , in the summertime , the weekly release and return of the pigeons was the primary source of entertainment and bonding . " in the 40s , 50s and 60s , there were soccer clubs , pigeon clubs and rabbit clubs , " he recounted .
" that was it . " at the time of germany 's reunification in 1990 , well after pigeon racing 's heyday , there were still around 80,000 breeders in west germany alone .
today the german association of homing pigeon breeders estimates around 60,000 in all of germany . even so , the competition has become a good deal fiercer . dietmar schulz and his wife heike no longer bring home the big prizes .
they can not keep up with today 's wealthy breeders , some of whom can afford to buy single pigeons for the price of small houses and hire drivers to cart their birds hundreds of kilometers each day for training flights . the doctor is in with so much focus on success , it 's hard to tell what pigeon breeders love more : their pigeons or winning .
as head veterinarian at the pigeon clinic in essen - part of the extensive and evermore specialized homing-pigeon infrastructure - ludger kamphausen says the breeder-bird relationship plays a big role in his work . " there are those who see the pigeons as pets that they love , and others who are just interested in the birds ' performance , and who calculate every veterinary procedure as a financial investment , " he said . during the summer racing season , the clinic sees thousands of pigeons each day , as breeders try to figure out why their birds are n't winning .
in view of the amount of money invested in the hobby , it 's not surprising that the state-of-the-art clinic offers the kind of medical care unavailable to most humans . kamphausen 's colleague , elisabeth peus , has a simple explanation for why her costly veterinary services are in such demand . " the joy that breeders feel when their pigeons come home is what they invest so much in , " she says .
" i personally do n't have pigeons , because i 'd be too scared that they would n't come home ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money is no object for some pigeon racers the next generation christian nuesser does n't share dr. peus ' fear .
a fourth-generation pigeon racer from linnich , near the dutch border , nuesser is one of the few young people active in the sport .
at 16 , he spends two hours every weekday caring for his birds , and five hours a day on weekends .
" my dream , " he said , " is to get a few good pigeons which fly very quick and to be on the top of the charts . "
nuesser does n't know any pigeon breeders his own age .
what puts off other kids , he thinks , is the large time investment that 's necessary . indeed , attracting youth is the biggest challenge facing pigeon racing today , according to 23-year-old ruben hermans , president of the west european youth commission for pigeon sport . " it takes a few years to win prizes , and many young people do n't have the patience , " he said . yet there is a youth pigeon-racing scene , even if small .

once a hobby for miners , pigeon racing now attracts the wealthy . thousands of peeled eyes and pricked ears follow the coveted first lot as it 's brought to the auction block in dortmund 's expo center .
within a few minutes the bids reach 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,730 -rrb- , and then the item is " going once , going twice , going three times , sold . "
the crowd roars as the happy bidders step forward - to claim their new homing pigeon .
this hullabaloo is n't about quicker postal service .
the pigeon is for racing . twenty thousand pigeon fanciers visited dortmund 's annual homing pigeon fair and auction in the heart of the ruhr valley this year . although the former mining region is european capital of culture for 2010 , it is still richer in local color than high art .
case in point : the region is and remains germany 's pigeon-racing stronghold . pigeon sport is changing though , like the ruhr area itself . a whole new game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon-racing youth groups promote the sport in his half century of pigeon racing , dietmar schulz has seen the sport change considerably .
the 66-year-old retired locksmith from bochum remembers the days when 30 pigeon fanciers lived on his street .
now there are only three .
back then , in the summertime , the weekly release and return of the pigeons was the primary source of entertainment and bonding . " in the 40s , 50s and 60s , there were soccer clubs , pigeon clubs and rabbit clubs , " he recounted .
" that was it . " at the time of germany 's reunification in 1990 , well after pigeon racing 's heyday , there were still around 80,000 breeders in west germany alone .
today the german association of homing pigeon breeders estimates around 60,000 in all of germany . even so , the competition has become a good deal fiercer . dietmar schulz and his wife heike no longer bring home the big prizes .
they can not keep up with today 's wealthy breeders , some of whom can afford to buy single pigeons for the price of small houses and hire drivers to cart their birds hundreds of kilometers each day for training flights . the doctor is in with so much focus on success , it 's hard to tell what pigeon breeders love more : their pigeons or winning .
as head veterinarian at the pigeon clinic in essen - part of the extensive and evermore specialized homing-pigeon infrastructure - ludger kamphausen says the breeder-bird relationship plays a big role in his work . " there are those who see the pigeons as pets that they love , and others who are just interested in the birds ' performance , and who calculate every veterinary procedure as a financial investment , " he said . during the summer racing season , the clinic sees thousands of pigeons each day , as breeders try to figure out why their birds are n't winning .
in view of the amount of money invested in the hobby , it 's not surprising that the state-of-the-art clinic offers the kind of medical care unavailable to most humans . kamphausen 's colleague , elisabeth peus , has a simple explanation for why her costly veterinary services are in such demand . " the joy that breeders feel when their pigeons come home is what they invest so much in , " she says .
" i personally do n't have pigeons , because i 'd be too scared that they would n't come home ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money is no object for some pigeon racers the next generation christian nuesser does n't share dr. peus ' fear .
a fourth-generation pigeon racer from linnich , near the dutch border , nuesser is one of the few young people active in the sport .
at 16 , he spends two hours every weekday caring for his birds , and five hours a day on weekends .
" my dream , " he said , " is to get a few good pigeons which fly very quick and to be on the top of the charts . "
nuesser does n't know any pigeon breeders his own age .
what puts off other kids , he thinks , is the large time investment that 's necessary . indeed , attracting youth is the biggest challenge facing pigeon racing today , according to 23-year-old ruben hermans , president of the west european youth commission for pigeon sport . " it takes a few years to win prizes , and many young people do n't have the patience , " he said . yet there is a youth pigeon-racing scene , even if small .
hermans came to the fair in dortmund with several of his pigeon-buddies and had a hand in the youth section of the fair , which included games and even a young people 's pigeon auction . " the best pigeon experience is to make a lot of social contact with other people , " hermans said , " in pigeon sport there are lots of friends - also older people , also people from all over the world . " a complex love ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon breeding is usually a family activity back in bochum , the schulz family are trying their luck with a new flock .
their last flock of birds all ended in the saucepan - the fate of many racing pigeons who do n't make the grade . mr. schulz has high expectations of his birds ' performance but says that his love of pigeons and his desire to win are one and the same .
mrs. schulz , however , says that in the end it 's not just about winning . " when you have a stressful day or you 're depressed , you can come in here and sit down , " she said .
" the pigeons come to you and you can cuddle with them .
it makes you feel good . " while some of the sport 's newer , wealthier participants may come and go , the old guard is in the game for good .
prizes or no prizes , the schulzes say they will be raising and racing pigeons for as long as they 're still standing . author : david levitz editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the red shirts hold suthep responsible for a clash with soldiers which left 25 people dead on april 10 , as he was in charge of security matters at that time .
suthep has denied responsibility for the deadly clash that was triggered by an unsuccessful attempt to remove the protesters by force .
but a government spokesman said suthep has agreed to meet investigators on tuesday to hear the accusations against him .
bargaining for bail thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva proposed a peace " road map " last week , which includes the dissolution of parliament in the second half of september and fresh elections on november 14 , as well as proposals for political reforms .
he also issued an ultimatum to the protesters , demanding they reply to his offer by monday , may 10 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red shirts will not end their protests for the time being the red shirts , supporters of the exiled former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , in turn also put forward several other demands , including a reopening of their tv channel .
observers believe they are reluctant to vacate their encampments because they fear legal repercussions for their partly violent protests .
their demand for suthep to turn himself in has been seen as an attempt to strike a bargain with the government to be assured bail once they end the protests. tb / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has shaped population curves all over the world , but not in china , where it ca n't seem to catch on . half a century ago , in the year 1960 , a birth control pill by the name of " evonid " went onto the market in the usa – today , 50 years later , the pill is one of the most important forms of contraception .
it is very popular in europe but in china , on the other hand , it is not so wide-spread .
the birth control pill is stocked on the shelves in every pharmacy in china - right next to nasal spray and pain relievers .
a month 's supply costs just over two euros .
people in china do not need a doctor 's prescription to buy it ; women who are interested just ask a pharmacist .
one woman in a pharmacy in beijing says , " i do n't know what different kinds of pills there are .

british elections last thursday resulted in a hung parliament , with neither of the major parties - center-left labour and the center-right conservatives - winning a majority in parliament .
nick clegg 's liberal democrat party came in third , allowing it to take on a kingmaker role for whichever of the major parties it chooses to form a coalition with .
the centrist lib dems spent the past three days holding coalition talks with the conservatives , led by david cameron .
brown 's announcement that he would " play no part " in the selection of the next labour leader came as a surprise .
brown said it was " in the interests of the whole country to form a progressive coalition government . "
" the reason we have a hung parliament is that no single party and no single leader was able to win the full support of the country , " brown said .
" as leader of my party , i must accept that that is a judgment on me . "

" five years ago , ruettgers won the nrw state election not because he was so convincing , but because the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- -green coalition government was doing so poorly .
this time , he lost the election - not because he was doing such a bad job , but because of the government in berlin . " the mass circulation bild zeitung writes in its monday edition that sunday 's state elections marked a " political landslide " in which voters gave merkel 's government a " lesson it will not forget during this term " , which lasts until 2013 .
" boom bang bang - nrw voters taught the christian democrats and free democrats a lesson and changed the country 's political statics , " writes the berliner morgenpost . the slap in the face by germany 's most populous state was meant also for chancellor -lrb- angela -rrb- merkel and her deputy -lrb- guido -rrb- westerwelle , the paper says , adding that in the end , it was most likely the highly unpopular greek bailout package that influenced the voters . the cdu and the fdp have suffered a major defeat , comments the ostsee-zeitung - with grave consequences beyond the state of nrw .
" the end of the cdu-fdp coalition government in nrw marks a turning point for the coalition with the same partners on the federal level as well , " the paper continues .
" the majority in the upper house is gone , and so are major projects : tax reform and extending the life-span of germany 's nuclear power plants .
the wiggle room for angela merkel and her deputy , fdp leader guido westerwelle , has shrunk before they even dared use it . "
the rheinische post also regards the loss of the majority in the upper house , the bundesrat , as a problem for angela merkel and her coalition government .
" no matter who ends up forming the new government in nrw , the chancellor will have to scramble for a majority in the bundesrat in each individual case . " ruettgers is taking the rap for a situation that berlin is really responsible for , writes the donaukurier . " voters in nrw did n't vote against juergen ruettgers ; rather , they showed angela merkel and guido westerwelle the yellow card . losing the majority in the upper house is a just penalty for a never-ending discussion on tax reforms that has paralysed the lower house of parliament for the past six months .

" five years ago , ruettgers won the nrw state election not because he was so convincing , but because the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- -green coalition government was doing so poorly .
this time , he lost the election - not because he was doing such a bad job , but because of the government in berlin . " the mass circulation bild zeitung writes in its monday edition that sunday 's state elections marked a " political landslide " in which voters gave merkel 's government a " lesson it will not forget during this term " , which lasts until 2013 .
" boom bang bang - nrw voters taught the christian democrats and free democrats a lesson and changed the country 's political statics , " writes the berliner morgenpost . the slap in the face by germany 's most populous state was meant also for chancellor -lrb- angela -rrb- merkel and her deputy -lrb- guido -rrb- westerwelle , the paper says , adding that in the end , it was most likely the highly unpopular greek bailout package that influenced the voters . the cdu and the fdp have suffered a major defeat , comments the ostsee-zeitung - with grave consequences beyond the state of nrw .
" the end of the cdu-fdp coalition government in nrw marks a turning point for the coalition with the same partners on the federal level as well , " the paper continues .
" the majority in the upper house is gone , and so are major projects : tax reform and extending the life-span of germany 's nuclear power plants .
the wiggle room for angela merkel and her deputy , fdp leader guido westerwelle , has shrunk before they even dared use it . "
the rheinische post also regards the loss of the majority in the upper house , the bundesrat , as a problem for angela merkel and her coalition government .
" no matter who ends up forming the new government in nrw , the chancellor will have to scramble for a majority in the bundesrat in each individual case . " ruettgers is taking the rap for a situation that berlin is really responsible for , writes the donaukurier . " voters in nrw did n't vote against juergen ruettgers ; rather , they showed angela merkel and guido westerwelle the yellow card . losing the majority in the upper house is a just penalty for a never-ending discussion on tax reforms that has paralysed the lower house of parliament for the past six months .

the funds will be used to rescue any eurozone country that gets into serious financial difficulty . news of the proposed eurozone stability package saw markets rise worldwide on monday , which was just the sort of reaction that european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund had hoped for .
frankfurt 's dax closed the day up 5.3 percent , london 's ftse 100 index ended the day up 5.16 percent , while in paris , the cac-40 soared to close up by 9.66 percent .
in new york , the dow jones jumped by more than four percent in early trading .
the euro shot up by 1.5 cents against the us dollar after the announcement of the deal , then fell slightly to 1.28 dollars as the markets waited to see if member nations would follow through with austerity measures .
this followed a 14-month low against the dollar last week , amid uncertainty that the bloc would rescue greece , spain and portugal from possible default . the markets were reacting to an announcement made by european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund in brussels early on monday , that they had agreed on the creation of permanent measures worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 964 billion -rrb- to bail out eurozone states that run into financial difficulty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has already secured a 110 billion-euro loan package from the eurozone and the imf under the plan , the european commission is to provide 60 billion euros , while members of the 16-nation eurozone have pledged 440 billion euros to the fund .
the imf is to contribute an additional 250 billion euros , said spanish finance minister elena salgado .
german chancellor angela merkel said that the nearly trillion-dollar package would serve to " strengthen and protect " the euro .
she said that the eurozone must actively resolve its stability problem " at the roots " by pressing member states to balance their budgets .
" budget consolidation in all member states is extraordinarily important , " said merkel .
the chancellor also welcomed new austerity measures promised by the spanish government , saying they send an important message to the markets .
washington has praised europe 's stabilization plans . one white house official said president barack obama supports " assertive action " to address the greek debt crisis , and that european leaders have his support .
calming the markets the european commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , olli rehn , said the massive bailout " proves that we will defend the euro , whatever it takes . "
the european central bank will also implement exceptional measures in support of the package , the eu 's top economic official said on monday .
international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn hailed the package as a big step forward , and said the imf would be happy to contribute should eurozone countries require additional help from beyond the european central bank .
calming the fears of international markets appears to be the main goal of the package , but swedish finance minister anders borg described the situation more bluntly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets seem to approve of the eurozone measures " we now see herd behavior in the markets that is really pack behavior , wolf pack behavior , " borg told reporters .
" if we will not stop these packs , they will tear the weaker countries apart . "
meanwhile , britain 's chancellor of the exchequer , alistair darling , said the package was a " good deal " for europe , and that it was in the best interests of britain 's banks and export market .
however , darling did make it clear that this was a problem for the eurogroup .
" what we ca n't do is provide support for the euro , " said darling .
" that 's got to be for those countries that use the euro that are members of the eurogroup . "
awkward timing the euro stabilization deal comes just as state elections in germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , have taken away merkel 's majority in the upper house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disapproval of the greek bailout could have been one of the factors to the cdu 's majority loss the results of the election in north rhine-westphalia were seen by some as a reaction to merkel 's reluctant support of the eu 's greek bailout , which is unpopular with many voters in germany .
nevertheless , merkel stressed the measures were needed to protect the euro and german incomes .
" it is the first time in the history of the euro and the eu , and we are protecting our currency in an extraordinary situation , " said merkel .
" i can also put it this way to the population : we are protecting the money of the people in germany . "

this followed a 14-month low against the dollar last week , amid uncertainty that the bloc would rescue greece , spain and portugal from possible default . the markets were reacting to an announcement made by european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund in brussels early on monday , that they had agreed on the creation of permanent measures worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 964 billion -rrb- to bail out eurozone states that run into financial difficulty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has already secured a 110 billion-euro loan package from the eurozone and the imf under the plan , the european commission is to provide 60 billion euros , while members of the 16-nation eurozone have pledged 440 billion euros to the fund .
the imf is to contribute an additional 250 billion euros , said spanish finance minister elena salgado .
german chancellor angela merkel said that the nearly trillion-dollar package would serve to " strengthen and protect " the euro .
she said that the eurozone must actively resolve its stability problem " at the roots " by pressing member states to balance their budgets .
" budget consolidation in all member states is extraordinarily important , " said merkel .
the chancellor also welcomed new austerity measures promised by the spanish government , saying they send an important message to the markets .

the european central bank will also implement exceptional measures in support of the package , the eu 's top economic official said on monday .
international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn hailed the package as a big step forward , and said the imf would be happy to contribute should eurozone countries require additional help from beyond the european central bank .

however , darling did make it clear that this was a problem for the eurogroup .
" what we ca n't do is provide support for the euro , " said darling .
" that 's got to be for those countries that use the euro that are members of the eurogroup . "

the funds will be used to rescue any eurozone country that gets into serious financial difficulty . news of the proposed eurozone stability package saw markets rise worldwide on monday , which was just the sort of reaction that european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund had hoped for .
frankfurt 's dax closed the day up 5.3 percent , london 's ftse 100 index ended the day up 5.16 percent , while in paris , the cac-40 soared to close up by 9.66 percent .
in new york , the dow jones jumped by more than four percent in early trading .
the euro shot up by 1.5 cents against the us dollar after the announcement of the deal , then fell slightly to 1.28 dollars as the markets waited to see if member nations would follow through with austerity measures .
this followed a 14-month low against the dollar last week , amid uncertainty that the bloc would rescue greece , spain and portugal from possible default . the markets were reacting to an announcement made by european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund in brussels early on monday , that they had agreed on the creation of permanent measures worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 964 billion -rrb- to bail out eurozone states that run into financial difficulty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has already secured a 110 billion-euro loan package from the eurozone and the imf under the plan , the european commission is to provide 60 billion euros , while members of the 16-nation eurozone have pledged 440 billion euros to the fund .
the imf is to contribute an additional 250 billion euros , said spanish finance minister elena salgado .
german chancellor angela merkel said that the nearly trillion-dollar package would serve to " strengthen and protect " the euro .
she said that the eurozone must actively resolve its stability problem " at the roots " by pressing member states to balance their budgets .
" budget consolidation in all member states is extraordinarily important , " said merkel .
the chancellor also welcomed new austerity measures promised by the spanish government , saying they send an important message to the markets .
washington has praised europe 's stabilization plans . one white house official said president barack obama supports " assertive action " to address the greek debt crisis , and that european leaders have his support .
calming the markets the european commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , olli rehn , said the massive bailout " proves that we will defend the euro , whatever it takes . "
the european central bank will also implement exceptional measures in support of the package , the eu 's top economic official said on monday .
international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn hailed the package as a big step forward , and said the imf would be happy to contribute should eurozone countries require additional help from beyond the european central bank .
calming the fears of international markets appears to be the main goal of the package , but swedish finance minister anders borg described the situation more bluntly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets seem to approve of the eurozone measures " we now see herd behavior in the markets that is really pack behavior , wolf pack behavior , " borg told reporters .
" if we will not stop these packs , they will tear the weaker countries apart . "
meanwhile , britain 's chancellor of the exchequer , alistair darling , said the package was a " good deal " for europe , and that it was in the best interests of britain 's banks and export market .
however , darling did make it clear that this was a problem for the eurogroup .
" what we ca n't do is provide support for the euro , " said darling .
" that 's got to be for those countries that use the euro that are members of the eurogroup . "
awkward timing the euro stabilization deal comes just as state elections in germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , have taken away merkel 's majority in the upper house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disapproval of the greek bailout could have been one of the factors to the cdu 's majority loss the results of the election in north rhine-westphalia were seen by some as a reaction to merkel 's reluctant support of the eu 's greek bailout , which is unpopular with many voters in germany .
nevertheless , merkel stressed the measures were needed to protect the euro and german incomes .
" it is the first time in the history of the euro and the eu , and we are protecting our currency in an extraordinary situation , " said merkel .
" i can also put it this way to the population : we are protecting the money of the people in germany . "
the european commission is planning to meet on wednesday to determine how to strengthen eu budget rules and economic surveillance in the eurozone to avoid a future crisis. mk / gb / apf / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" five years ago , ruettgers won the nrw state election not because he was so convincing , but because the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- -green coalition government was doing so poorly .
this time , he lost the election - not because he was doing such a bad job , but because of the government in berlin . " the mass circulation bild zeitung writes in its monday edition that sunday 's state elections marked a " political landslide " in which voters gave merkel 's government a " lesson it will not forget during this term " , which lasts until 2013 .
" boom bang bang - nrw voters taught the christian democrats and free democrats a lesson and changed the country 's political statics , " writes the berliner morgenpost . the slap in the face by germany 's most populous state was meant also for chancellor -lrb- angela -rrb- merkel and her deputy -lrb- guido -rrb- westerwelle , the paper says , adding that in the end , it was most likely the highly unpopular greek bailout package that influenced the voters . the cdu and the fdp have suffered a major defeat , comments the ostsee-zeitung - with grave consequences beyond the state of nrw .
" the end of the cdu-fdp coalition government in nrw marks a turning point for the coalition with the same partners on the federal level as well , " the paper continues .
" the majority in the upper house is gone , and so are major projects : tax reform and extending the life-span of germany 's nuclear power plants .
the wiggle room for angela merkel and her deputy , fdp leader guido westerwelle , has shrunk before they even dared use it . "

british elections last thursday resulted in a hung parliament , with neither of the major parties - center-left labour and the center-right conservatives - winning a majority in parliament .
nick clegg 's liberal democrat party came in third , allowing it to take on a kingmaker role for whichever of the major parties it chooses to form a coalition with .
the centrist lib dems spent the past three days holding coalition talks with the conservatives , led by david cameron .
brown 's announcement that he would " play no part " in the selection of the next labour leader came as a surprise .
brown said it was " in the interests of the whole country to form a progressive coalition government . "
" the reason we have a hung parliament is that no single party and no single leader was able to win the full support of the country , " brown said .
" as leader of my party , i must accept that that is a judgment on me . "
brown said he hoped that a new leader would be chosen before the party conference in september. svs / dpa / afp editor : send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the red shirts hold suthep responsible for a clash with soldiers which left 25 people dead on april 10 , as he was in charge of security matters at that time .
suthep has denied responsibility for the deadly clash that was triggered by an unsuccessful attempt to remove the protesters by force .
but a government spokesman said suthep has agreed to meet investigators on tuesday to hear the accusations against him .
bargaining for bail thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva proposed a peace " road map " last week , which includes the dissolution of parliament in the second half of september and fresh elections on november 14 , as well as proposals for political reforms .
he also issued an ultimatum to the protesters , demanding they reply to his offer by monday , may 10 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red shirts will not end their protests for the time being the red shirts , supporters of the exiled former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , in turn also put forward several other demands , including a reopening of their tv channel .
observers believe they are reluctant to vacate their encampments because they fear legal repercussions for their partly violent protests .
their demand for suthep to turn himself in has been seen as an attempt to strike a bargain with the government to be assured bail once they end the protests. tb / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has shaped population curves all over the world , but not in china , where it ca n't seem to catch on . half a century ago , in the year 1960 , a birth control pill by the name of " evonid " went onto the market in the usa – today , 50 years later , the pill is one of the most important forms of contraception .
it is very popular in europe but in china , on the other hand , it is not so wide-spread .
the birth control pill is stocked on the shelves in every pharmacy in china - right next to nasal spray and pain relievers .
a month 's supply costs just over two euros .
people in china do not need a doctor 's prescription to buy it ; women who are interested just ask a pharmacist .
one woman in a pharmacy in beijing says , " i do n't know what different kinds of pills there are .
i buy the one that the pharmacist suggests - the one with the least amount of side-effects . "
sexual emancipation - in the west when the pill went on the market in the usa in 1960 , china was quick to follow .
a few years later the country came out with its own contraceptive pills .
in the west , the pill was celebrated as sexual emancipation for women , but in china it was seen as merely a new form of contraception that could help slow down the rapid growth of the population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many young chinese women use the pill for contraception one woman from beijing remembers how the government propagated the pill .
she says , " in the beginning , our work units handed out the pill to us .
you could just go there and get it for free . "
despite being promoted by the government , the pill was never really accepted as a universal form of contraceptive in china , neither in the cities , nor in the country .
according to official chinese statistics , merely two to three percent of chinese women take the pill .
and even those numbers are dwindling .
' throws the body off balance ' women in beijing say they do n't like the pill 's side-effects .
one woman says , " the good thing about the pill is that it makes your skin nice and reduces acne , but it is also unhealthy .
i have heard it can cause vascular diseases in women over 40 and it is also not good for the heart . "
another woman agrees : " i used to take it , but only seldom .
taking the pill is primitive ; there are too many side-effects and it can cause damage to the body .
it throws the body off balance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six women who did n't take the pill - these ladies flaunt their bumps for the 2008 olympics other methods of contraception are preferred in china , like the contraceptive coil , condoms and plain " being careful " .
but because the latter is far from fool-proof , abortions are also very common .
they are carried out in normal hospitals or in private and often illegal clinics , where prices are very low , as are hygienic standards .
in a regular hospital , an abortion costs around 100 euros and getting an appointment is never a problem .
the patients do not need a doctor 's approval , nor consultation .
more and more young women get abortions , some even get many ; there is no talk of the psychological impact abortions can have .
china is one-of-a-kind in this respect .
it is not likely that china will ever change its policy and promote the pill over abortions .
discussions about the moral implications of killing an unborn child do not officially take place .

first there was the question whether germany even needed such a memorial and then what it should look like .
when american designer peter eisenman finally presented his design after considerable wrangling , the criticism came pouring in .
the memorial contained 2,711 concrete steles .
" too blockish , " complained the critics , " too abstract . "
they said it was just another drop zone for memorial wreaths , an adventure playground for teenaged antics .
a final stroke carved in stone for historical amnesiacs .
even an invitation for neo-nazi vandalism in the middle of berlin .
though the skepticism and concern were understandable , it has become clear over the five years of the monument 's existence that they were unnecessary . the field of pillars lies at the heart of berlin in quick walking distance to the brandenburg gate - arguably germany 's most famous national symbol .
open to visitors at all times , the memorial is not fenced off , there 's no entry fee , and it requires no more from its visitors than a willingness to engage with it .
the underground information center , which was added later , complements the abstract monument by giving the names of the victims and telling their tales of suffering .
some two million people have already visited the center ; many more have walked through the monument above .
even if it is just one more sight to see on their tour of berlin , the number of visitors the memorial receives daily testifies to the monument having become just as part of everyday life as it is part of germany 's larger culture of remembrance .
those who wish to learn more about the holocaust do n't have to look far .
the newly openend " topography of terror " - a sort of counterpart to the memorial - tells the story of the nazis ' crimes against humanity in explicit detail .
meanwhile , the memorial to europe 's murdered jews , remarkable for its abstraction and size , has become part of berlin 's historical landscape .
it is part of a germany-wide network of holocaust museums and memorials that so often commemorate victims ' individual fates .
one should not forget , as the memorial marks its fifth anniversary , that it was not something forced on the country from above or by the descendents of the victims .
nor did its conceptualization begin at an official level .
in fact , the idea was born twenty years ago in a citizens ' initiative spearheaded by journalist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
and so the monument is , in the best sense , a manifestation of personal dedication and historical conscience .
this memorial replaces neither live conversations with those who endured the holcaust , nor the private mourning of individuals .
and it certainly does n't absolve us from our responsibility of coming to terms with the holocaust , national-socialism and war in general in our schools , scholarship and society .
it is , however , an example of how intensively - after a long period of concealment and sugar-coating - germany is dealing with its nazi past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 10.05.2010 five years on , berlin holocaust memorial is a landmark of remembrance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin holocaust memorial was a long time in the making now five years old , berlin 's holocaust memorial serves as a landmark of remembrance and a symbol of collective conscience - even as the structure threatens to crumble .
dw looks at the memorial 's past , present and future . in 1953 - in the wake of the holocaust - a first order of business for the young israeli state was the construction of the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem .
forty years later , washington , d.c. built its holocaust memorial .
yet it was n't until 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii , that germany , the atrocity 's perpetrator , unveiled its memorial to the murdered jews of europe . it 's been five years since the holocaust memorial opened at the center of berlin .
support and appreciation for the monument - which caused 13 years of heated debate and may now be disintegrating - is stronger than ever . a grassroots proposal the idea for the memorial first came at the beginning of 1989 through a citizens ' initiative in berlin , spearheaded by journalist and publicist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
the group wanted to see a national memorial to the jews who perished in the holocaust built in berlin , which was the capital of east germany at the time . with the fall of the berlin wall a few months later and the excitement of germany 's reunification shortly thereafter , the idea was almost immediately placed on the backburner .
a few years later , in 1992 , chancellor helmut kohl 's government became proponents of the memorial 's construction and set aside space for it next to berlin 's brandenburg gate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect peter eisenman says he could n't have done it without rosh 's support in bonn , still the capital of west germany , many parliamentarians fought for the monument to be built .
among them was christian democrat norbert lammert , who is now head of the memorial 's curatorial committee . lammert says that he and several others " emphatically advocated that the government 's move to berlin after reunification needed to begin with such a demonstrative sign . " but the monument itself would not be realized for quite some time .
after rounds of hearings , debates , competitions and exhibitions , the german parliament finally decided to create a foundation to decide on and implement a design for the memorial . throughout this process and the further debates that ensued , the memorial 's conceptualists , rosh and jaeckel , remained clear on what they wanted their brainchild to accomplish .
" we wanted the memorial to do three things , " rosh told deutsche welle : " to commemorate what took place , to honor the victims and to give them back their names . " the fruits of a long labor today , the monument does just that .
spreading over 19,000 square meters -lrb- over 200,000 square feet -rrb- in the middle of berlin , the memorial to the murdered jews of europe is made up of 2,711 gray , concrete steles of varying heights - a seemingly endless landscape of concrete waves that ca n't be overlooked . some critics found the monument too abstract and anonymous , so an information center was later added beneath the terrain , where visitors can learn about the holocaust and its victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial , located at the heart of berlin , is facing serious renovation the monument 's designer , american architect peter eisenman , has not been back to the memorial since its opening in may 2005 , and was originally against the addition of the information center .
now , he is more pleased than ever with his work . " it 's unusual for an american to sit here and say , it was my intention to give you back your memory , " eisenman said .
" it sounds rather condescending , but i think if i had been german , i would have done it and perceived it in the same way . " it was n't an easy road for eisenman ; the memorial that was finally constructed was the second proposal , after the large-scale sculptor richard serra backed out of the project . " i 'm very proud of what we accomplished .
we encountered a great deal of disputes and setbacks .
but lea rosh kept us from giving up , and step by step we got there .
by now , those difficulties have faded into history .
now it 's about the present and the future . looking forward the monument 's future is not fully unproblematic .
recently , faulty construction has begun taking a toll on the concrete pillars , and renovation or partial reconstruction will soon become urgently necessary . uwe neumaerker , the director of the memorial foundation , told deutsche welle he does not know how long the process will take , adding that " tests have shown that unfortunately it will take a very long time . "
still , neumaerker assures that " nothing will fall apart . " more likely than the memorial 's concrete steles falling on visitors , it seems , is visitors falling off steles .
the monument has become a popular destination for games of hide-and-seek , parkour daredevils and sun-worshippers that come on warm days to enjoy the shade-free tops of the steles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial is sometimes used for other purposes rosh takes a relatively relaxed stance toward visitors repurposing her memorial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 10.05.2010 five years on , berlin holocaust memorial is a landmark of remembrance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin holocaust memorial was a long time in the making now five years old , berlin 's holocaust memorial serves as a landmark of remembrance and a symbol of collective conscience - even as the structure threatens to crumble .
dw looks at the memorial 's past , present and future . in 1953 - in the wake of the holocaust - a first order of business for the young israeli state was the construction of the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem .
forty years later , washington , d.c. built its holocaust memorial .
yet it was n't until 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii , that germany , the atrocity 's perpetrator , unveiled its memorial to the murdered jews of europe . it 's been five years since the holocaust memorial opened at the center of berlin .
support and appreciation for the monument - which caused 13 years of heated debate and may now be disintegrating - is stronger than ever . a grassroots proposal the idea for the memorial first came at the beginning of 1989 through a citizens ' initiative in berlin , spearheaded by journalist and publicist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
the group wanted to see a national memorial to the jews who perished in the holocaust built in berlin , which was the capital of east germany at the time . with the fall of the berlin wall a few months later and the excitement of germany 's reunification shortly thereafter , the idea was almost immediately placed on the backburner .
a few years later , in 1992 , chancellor helmut kohl 's government became proponents of the memorial 's construction and set aside space for it next to berlin 's brandenburg gate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect peter eisenman says he could n't have done it without rosh 's support in bonn , still the capital of west germany , many parliamentarians fought for the monument to be built .
among them was christian democrat norbert lammert , who is now head of the memorial 's curatorial committee . lammert says that he and several others " emphatically advocated that the government 's move to berlin after reunification needed to begin with such a demonstrative sign . " but the monument itself would not be realized for quite some time .
after rounds of hearings , debates , competitions and exhibitions , the german parliament finally decided to create a foundation to decide on and implement a design for the memorial . throughout this process and the further debates that ensued , the memorial 's conceptualists , rosh and jaeckel , remained clear on what they wanted their brainchild to accomplish .
" we wanted the memorial to do three things , " rosh told deutsche welle : " to commemorate what took place , to honor the victims and to give them back their names . " the fruits of a long labor today , the monument does just that .
spreading over 19,000 square meters -lrb- over 200,000 square feet -rrb- in the middle of berlin , the memorial to the murdered jews of europe is made up of 2,711 gray , concrete steles of varying heights - a seemingly endless landscape of concrete waves that ca n't be overlooked . some critics found the monument too abstract and anonymous , so an information center was later added beneath the terrain , where visitors can learn about the holocaust and its victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial , located at the heart of berlin , is facing serious renovation the monument 's designer , american architect peter eisenman , has not been back to the memorial since its opening in may 2005 , and was originally against the addition of the information center .
now , he is more pleased than ever with his work . " it 's unusual for an american to sit here and say , it was my intention to give you back your memory , " eisenman said .
" it sounds rather condescending , but i think if i had been german , i would have done it and perceived it in the same way . " it was n't an easy road for eisenman ; the memorial that was finally constructed was the second proposal , after the large-scale sculptor richard serra backed out of the project . " i 'm very proud of what we accomplished .
we encountered a great deal of disputes and setbacks .
but lea rosh kept us from giving up , and step by step we got there .
by now , those difficulties have faded into history .
now it 's about the present and the future . looking forward the monument 's future is not fully unproblematic .
recently , faulty construction has begun taking a toll on the concrete pillars , and renovation or partial reconstruction will soon become urgently necessary . uwe neumaerker , the director of the memorial foundation , told deutsche welle he does not know how long the process will take , adding that " tests have shown that unfortunately it will take a very long time . "
still , neumaerker assures that " nothing will fall apart . " more likely than the memorial 's concrete steles falling on visitors , it seems , is visitors falling off steles .
the monument has become a popular destination for games of hide-and-seek , parkour daredevils and sun-worshippers that come on warm days to enjoy the shade-free tops of the steles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial is sometimes used for other purposes rosh takes a relatively relaxed stance toward visitors repurposing her memorial . " sometimes i go and see people sunning themselves on the steles and tell them that there are lawns for sunbathing in the tiergarten just across the street , " she said .
" i tell the boys who are hopping around on the steles that they should do that somewhere else . " when i tell the eight- to 12-year-olds that they should go into the information center below the memorial and then come talk to me about it , it 's always very powerful .

those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .
no-names were the stars bildunterschrift : klose had a lot of time for rest and reflection this season the mvp of the season was arjen robben , who brought a whole new level of class to the bundesliga , but otherwise this was not a good year for marquee players .
at bayern , van gaal decided he could largely live without luca toni , miroslav klose , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuck , whose services had cost bayern at least 66 million euros -lrb- $ 86 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .
they 'll be playing in the champions league next season .
cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .
comedies of errors bildunterschrift : burchert learned the hard way about the risks of coming out of goal 2009-10 will also be remembered as the year established clubs found new and innovative ways to lose .
no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .
in fact , sometimes german football resembled professional wrestling , with a variety of objects being enlisted to help individuals express their dissatisfaction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero 's aim , in this instance , was good in bochum , a security official was clobbered with a chair , as fans realized they , too , had been relegated .
and down in the second division , hansa rostock supporters hit their own goalkeeper with a tossed firecracker .
but one player fought back .
hamburg striker paolo guerrero beaned a supporter with a water bottle after some unappreciated criticism .
it was one of peruvian 's rare appearances - he missed 28 games due to injury , fear of flying and suspension .
" when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro , " wrote the late , great hunter s. thompson .
but 2009-10 was a year in which once the season got going , the pros turned weird .

those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .
no-names were the stars bildunterschrift : klose had a lot of time for rest and reflection this season the mvp of the season was arjen robben , who brought a whole new level of class to the bundesliga , but otherwise this was not a good year for marquee players .
at bayern , van gaal decided he could largely live without luca toni , miroslav klose , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuck , whose services had cost bayern at least 66 million euros -lrb- $ 86 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .

cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .
comedies of errors bildunterschrift : burchert learned the hard way about the risks of coming out of goal 2009-10 will also be remembered as the year established clubs found new and innovative ways to lose .
no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .
in fact , sometimes german football resembled professional wrestling , with a variety of objects being enlisted to help individuals express their dissatisfaction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero 's aim , in this instance , was good in bochum , a security official was clobbered with a chair , as fans realized they , too , had been relegated .
and down in the second division , hansa rostock supporters hit their own goalkeeper with a tossed firecracker .
but one player fought back .
hamburg striker paolo guerrero beaned a supporter with a water bottle after some unappreciated criticism .
it was one of peruvian 's rare appearances - he missed 28 games due to injury , fear of flying and suspension .
" when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro , " wrote the late , great hunter s. thompson .
but 2009-10 was a year in which once the season got going , the pros turned weird .

at bayern , van gaal decided he could largely live without luca toni , miroslav klose , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuck , whose services had cost bayern at least 66 million euros -lrb- $ 86 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .

cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .

no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .

those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .

the red shirts hold suthep responsible for a clash with soldiers which left 25 people dead on april 10 , as he was in charge of security matters at that time .
suthep has denied responsibility for the deadly clash that was triggered by an unsuccessful attempt to remove the protesters by force .
but a government spokesman said suthep has agreed to meet investigators on tuesday to hear the accusations against him .
bargaining for bail thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva proposed a peace " road map " last week , which includes the dissolution of parliament in the second half of september and fresh elections on november 14 , as well as proposals for political reforms .
he also issued an ultimatum to the protesters , demanding they reply to his offer by monday , may 10 .

their demand for suthep to turn himself in has been seen as an attempt to strike a bargain with the government to be assured bail once they end the protests. tb / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

british elections last thursday resulted in a hung parliament , with neither of the major parties - center-left labour and the center-right conservatives - winning a majority in parliament .
nick clegg 's liberal democrat party came in third , allowing it to take on a kingmaker role for whichever of the major parties it chooses to form a coalition with .
the centrist lib dems spent the past three days holding coalition talks with the conservatives , led by david cameron .
brown 's announcement that he would " play no part " in the selection of the next labour leader came as a surprise .
brown said it was " in the interests of the whole country to form a progressive coalition government . "
" the reason we have a hung parliament is that no single party and no single leader was able to win the full support of the country , " brown said .
" as leader of my party , i must accept that that is a judgment on me . "
brown said he hoped that a new leader would be chosen before the party conference in september. svs / dpa / afp editor : send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the east asian nation has not only become one of sri lanka 's key trade partners and a major military ally , but it has helped the south asian country counter western pressure on issues such as human rights . it has been a year since sri lanka 's army secured victory over the tamil tiger rebels or ltte and the decades ' old civil war came to an end .
this would n't have become possible without the support of sri lanka 's key ally china , many in the south asian nation think .
" china helped the sri lankan state immensely with the war with the ltte when the sri lankan government needed assistance in terms of weapons and ammunition etc , " says si keethaponcalan , an expert from the university of colombo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sri lankan army received ammunition from china during the war diplomatic support the people 's republic 's support came on the diplomatic front as well .
when the west sharply criticized the sri lankan government 's handling of the conflict , particularly the final stages of the war , and the us stopped its military aid over human rights issues , beijing threw its weight behind colombo by blocking a resolution censuring sri lanka at the un security council .
after that the relations between the two traditional allies strengthened further . experts say the basis for the close bilateral ties between the two sides is the fact that china ’ s support to sri lanka is unconditional .

some western media have reported that china would like to use it as a naval base .

a debacle , a german political analyst says . " merkel has to start to think about how she can stay in power and make political decisions until the next federal elections in 2013 , " gero neugebauer , an analyst at the berlin-based otto-suhr-institute of political science , told deutsche welle .
until now , the western german state of north rhine-westphalia was ruled by the same coalition of center-right parties that angela merkel leads in berlin , the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the business-friendly , liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
sunday 's poll is being seen as a damaging referendum on her government in its first electoral test since she won re-election last september .
with both parties returning disappointing results , they no longer hold a majority of seats in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament .
merkel 's coalition is now in for tougher compromise negotiations with the social democratic and green opposition at the federal level when it comes to controversial plans for tax and budget cuts and health-care reform .
less room to maneuver " sixteen state governments and seven different types of coalitions - that has n't been easy in the past , and it will become more difficult in the future , " neugebauer said , adding that the chancellor could also benefit from the election results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's ruettgers could n't bring home the win merkel needed " merkel could use her party 's defeat and that of her coalition partner 's party to put more pressure on the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- to cooperate more closely than before . "
she could tell the liberals to " keep silent and reduce their demands . "
first , however , merkel may have to deal with critics from within her own party .
" the strategy of doing nothing has failed , " josef schlarmann , head of the cdu 's business wing and a member of the party executive told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
the cdu premiers , peter mueller of saarland and christian wulff of lower saxony warned that " business as usual " is not how the coalition government should proceed .
no more dithering a christian democratic politician and former deputy defense minister has called for serious consequences : " resignations are unavoidable to avoid a lingering decline , " willy wimmer told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
merkel must rethink her style of governing , political analyst neugebauer said .
" what she likes most is to sit in the middle and to try to mediate , to negotiate and to bring things together .
what she has to learn is that she ca n't always prevent every crisis - crisis management , that is what has to learn . "
the election debacle comes as eurozone members agreed late on sunday to an unprecedented 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 960 billion -rrb- safety net to ensure the stability of the euro currency .
merkel was scheduled to meet with all party leaders later on monday to discuss the deal , which requires legislative approval .

a debacle , a german political analyst says . " merkel has to start to think about how she can stay in power and make political decisions until the next federal elections in 2013 , " gero neugebauer , an analyst at the berlin-based otto-suhr-institute of political science , told deutsche welle .
until now , the western german state of north rhine-westphalia was ruled by the same coalition of center-right parties that angela merkel leads in berlin , the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the business-friendly , liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
sunday 's poll is being seen as a damaging referendum on her government in its first electoral test since she won re-election last september .
with both parties returning disappointing results , they no longer hold a majority of seats in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament .
merkel 's coalition is now in for tougher compromise negotiations with the social democratic and green opposition at the federal level when it comes to controversial plans for tax and budget cuts and health-care reform .
less room to maneuver " sixteen state governments and seven different types of coalitions - that has n't been easy in the past , and it will become more difficult in the future , " neugebauer said , adding that the chancellor could also benefit from the election results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's ruettgers could n't bring home the win merkel needed " merkel could use her party 's defeat and that of her coalition partner 's party to put more pressure on the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- to cooperate more closely than before . "
she could tell the liberals to " keep silent and reduce their demands . "
first , however , merkel may have to deal with critics from within her own party .
" the strategy of doing nothing has failed , " josef schlarmann , head of the cdu 's business wing and a member of the party executive told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
the cdu premiers , peter mueller of saarland and christian wulff of lower saxony warned that " business as usual " is not how the coalition government should proceed .
no more dithering a christian democratic politician and former deputy defense minister has called for serious consequences : " resignations are unavoidable to avoid a lingering decline , " willy wimmer told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
merkel must rethink her style of governing , political analyst neugebauer said .
" what she likes most is to sit in the middle and to try to mediate , to negotiate and to bring things together .
what she has to learn is that she ca n't always prevent every crisis - crisis management , that is what has to learn . "
the election debacle comes as eurozone members agreed late on sunday to an unprecedented 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 960 billion -rrb- safety net to ensure the stability of the euro currency .
merkel was scheduled to meet with all party leaders later on monday to discuss the deal , which requires legislative approval .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 10.05.2010 five years on , berlin holocaust memorial is a landmark of remembrance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin holocaust memorial was a long time in the making now five years old , berlin 's holocaust memorial serves as a landmark of remembrance and a symbol of collective conscience - even as the structure threatens to crumble .
dw looks at the memorial 's past , present and future . in 1953 - in the wake of the holocaust - a first order of business for the young israeli state was the construction of the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem .
forty years later , washington , d.c. built its holocaust memorial .
yet it was n't until 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii , that germany , the atrocity 's perpetrator , unveiled its memorial to the murdered jews of europe . it 's been five years since the holocaust memorial opened at the center of berlin .
support and appreciation for the monument - which caused 13 years of heated debate and may now be disintegrating - is stronger than ever . a grassroots proposal the idea for the memorial first came at the beginning of 1989 through a citizens ' initiative in berlin , spearheaded by journalist and publicist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
the group wanted to see a national memorial to the jews who perished in the holocaust built in berlin , which was the capital of east germany at the time . with the fall of the berlin wall a few months later and the excitement of germany 's reunification shortly thereafter , the idea was almost immediately placed on the backburner .
a few years later , in 1992 , chancellor helmut kohl 's government became proponents of the memorial 's construction and set aside space for it next to berlin 's brandenburg gate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect peter eisenman says he could n't have done it without rosh 's support in bonn , still the capital of west germany , many parliamentarians fought for the monument to be built .
among them was christian democrat norbert lammert , who is now head of the memorial 's curatorial committee . lammert says that he and several others " emphatically advocated that the government 's move to berlin after reunification needed to begin with such a demonstrative sign . " but the monument itself would not be realized for quite some time .
after rounds of hearings , debates , competitions and exhibitions , the german parliament finally decided to create a foundation to decide on and implement a design for the memorial . throughout this process and the further debates that ensued , the memorial 's conceptualists , rosh and jaeckel , remained clear on what they wanted their brainchild to accomplish .
" we wanted the memorial to do three things , " rosh told deutsche welle : " to commemorate what took place , to honor the victims and to give them back their names . " the fruits of a long labor today , the monument does just that .
spreading over 19,000 square meters -lrb- over 200,000 square feet -rrb- in the middle of berlin , the memorial to the murdered jews of europe is made up of 2,711 gray , concrete steles of varying heights - a seemingly endless landscape of concrete waves that ca n't be overlooked . some critics found the monument too abstract and anonymous , so an information center was later added beneath the terrain , where visitors can learn about the holocaust and its victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial , located at the heart of berlin , is facing serious renovation the monument 's designer , american architect peter eisenman , has not been back to the memorial since its opening in may 2005 , and was originally against the addition of the information center .
now , he is more pleased than ever with his work . " it 's unusual for an american to sit here and say , it was my intention to give you back your memory , " eisenman said .
" it sounds rather condescending , but i think if i had been german , i would have done it and perceived it in the same way . " it was n't an easy road for eisenman ; the memorial that was finally constructed was the second proposal , after the large-scale sculptor richard serra backed out of the project . " i 'm very proud of what we accomplished .
we encountered a great deal of disputes and setbacks .
but lea rosh kept us from giving up , and step by step we got there .
by now , those difficulties have faded into history .
now it 's about the present and the future . looking forward the monument 's future is not fully unproblematic .
recently , faulty construction has begun taking a toll on the concrete pillars , and renovation or partial reconstruction will soon become urgently necessary . uwe neumaerker , the director of the memorial foundation , told deutsche welle he does not know how long the process will take , adding that " tests have shown that unfortunately it will take a very long time . "
still , neumaerker assures that " nothing will fall apart . " more likely than the memorial 's concrete steles falling on visitors , it seems , is visitors falling off steles .
the monument has become a popular destination for games of hide-and-seek , parkour daredevils and sun-worshippers that come on warm days to enjoy the shade-free tops of the steles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial is sometimes used for other purposes rosh takes a relatively relaxed stance toward visitors repurposing her memorial . " sometimes i go and see people sunning themselves on the steles and tell them that there are lawns for sunbathing in the tiergarten just across the street , " she said .
" i tell the boys who are hopping around on the steles that they should do that somewhere else . " when i tell the eight- to 12-year-olds that they should go into the information center below the memorial and then come talk to me about it , it 's always very powerful .
they tell me they 've learned a lot . " author : marcel fuerstenau -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dome , which was lowered to the seafloor last thursday , was meant to funnel leaking crude into a rigger .
the oil has been shooting into the gulf at a rate of 5,000 barrels -lrb- 210,000 gallons -rrb- per day , since an april 20 explosion off the coast of louisiana that left 11 missing and presumably dead .
with no quick fix in sight now and the oil slick reaching shorelines , bp is calling on clever non-experts to come up with solutions .
one sure option bp is putting a brave face on their current dilemma , which is bringing them tens of millions of dollars in new lawsuits , and costing them six million dollars -lrb- 4.6 million euros -rrb- in cleanup each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp 's 100-ton containment dome filled with ice crystals instead of funneling oil " i would n't say it 's failed yet , " said doug suttles , bp 's chief operating officer , the day after ice crystals clogged the containment dome .
" what i would say is , what we attempted to do last night did n't work . "
bp is considering using a smaller containment dome that will be less prone to clogging .
admiral thad allen , head of the us coast guard , also told cbs television that a type of plug was also being considered .
" they 're actually going to take a bunch of debris – shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that – and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up and stop the leak . "
however , experts warn that if such a procedure failed , it could cause the flow of the oil to increase exponentially .
the only sure option , geologist lorenz schwark told deutsche welle , is to drill a relief well to intercept the original well and to fill it with very heavy cement that would block the oil 's flow .
this process was used once in the gulf of mexico in 1979 ; at the time taking 10 months .
this time , he estimates , it will take about three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with no quick fix in sight , bp is looking for clever ideas from the public hair-brained schemes ?
publically flummoxed – and threatened by a drastic loss of face – bp has launched the website www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com to collect creative ideas from the general public on how to solve the spill .
submissions are then forwarded to engineers .
bp spokesperson bryan ferguson told reporters in louisiana that he had " no idea " to what extent these suggestions were being worked on , but said that bp had " flown in experts from around the world to collaborate and contemplate the ideas that are presented . "
most of the ideas being presented are probably not feasible , unfortunately .
professor schwark at the university of kiel said that he has received a number of emails himself in recent days from individuals wanting to present him their own ideas .
" most of them were quite drastic , including planting a nuclear device on the seafloor and just blowing up the whole area , " he said .
" i was wondering whether people do consider the effects of such an event if carried out under water in the real world , and not just in a comic film . "
a local initiative some initiatives led by non-experts are already underway along the threatened gulf shoreline .
in walton county , florida , sheriff michael a. adkinson unveiled his plan to protect 42 kilometers of white , sandy beaches .
adkinson has hired a private contractor to float several barges loaded with 1,400 pound -lrb- 635 kilogram -rrb- bales of hay into the gulf , which will then be shredded and blown onto the surface of the water , where he believes it will absorb the oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already doing damage to marine life , the spill threatens shorelines as well as for the source of the problem , schwark said , if his three-month estimation for relief efforts is correct and the oil flow remains constant , the amount spilled will total around 40 thousand tons , equal to the amount of oil leaked during the alaskan exxon-valdez disaster in 1989 – the biggest in us history to date .
schwark added that , given the 80-kilometer -lrb- 50-mile -rrb- distance from the shoreline in this case , he did n't think the overall environmental impact would be as devastating as in alaska .
said mary landry of the us coast guard , " i do n't think any of us know at this time what the impact will be on the environment , or the economic issues that are associated with this spill . "

the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were only marginally behind , winning 34.5 percent of the vote . the business-friendly free democrats , the cdu 's current coalition partner in north rhine-westphalia and at the national level , gained half a percentage point , winning 6.7 percent of the vote .
the environmentalist greens did the best , almost doubling their showing from the last state election , securing 12.1 percent .
the left party won 5.6 percent , and is now poised to enter the nrw state parliament for the first time .
the election outcome means that the opposition social democrats and the green party could narrowly form a governing coalition in germany 's most populous state with a slim one-vote majority , but would likely require support from the left party . the alternatives are a coalition between the cdu and the greens , a grand coalition of spd and cdu , a so-called ' jamaica ' alliance between the cdu , greens and fdp , or a ' traffic light ' coalition between the spd , greens and fdp .
a failed test the nrw state election was the first litmus test for chancellor merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp government . the loss in north rhine-westphalia has cost her government its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
the debacle in nrw will make it considerably harder for merkel to push through parliament key reforms and tax cuts needed to revitalize europe 's largest economy .
the election comes just days after the german bundestag approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
" this is a bitter defeat for the cdu in the state and federally , " gerd langguth , political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency . " it is also an object lesson for the performance of the federal government , especially for the fdp , " he added . " the greek aid package also had an effect .
people are n't happy about germany being europe 's paymaster , " he said . results that ca n't be ignored spd and green leaders took the election results as a sign of bigger changes to come in the country 's political landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft celebrates with other spd members " the spd is back ! "
social democrat candidate hannelore kraft told supporters as the first results came in . " an spd-green alliance is what north rhine-westphalia wants ! "
the co-chair of the greens , claudia roth , said the vote was the payback for the government 's decisions in berlin .
" for the federal cdu-fdp coalition , my friends , this is the beginning of the end , " she said .
a leading member of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach , also said the loss for the conservatives was a sign of bigger issues .
" i can only warn the cdu against trying to put a positive spin on this result , " he said .
" it is a huge disappointment . "
according to german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who also leads the fdp , the coalition government wo n't ignore these results , describing them as a " warning shot " by voters .
" citizens need to know that we have heard their message , " he said .
" we must redouble our efforts to win back the lost confidence in our work . " gb / afp / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the slick reaches us shores , bp wants you to come up with a solution . the 100-ton containment dome that bp hoped would stop an ongoing oil spill into the gulf of mexico , has failed after clogging with ice crystals .
the dome , which was lowered to the seafloor last thursday , was meant to funnel leaking crude into a rigger .
the oil has been shooting into the gulf at a rate of 5,000 barrels -lrb- 210,000 gallons -rrb- per day , since an april 20 explosion off the coast of louisiana that left 11 missing and presumably dead .
with no quick fix in sight now and the oil slick reaching shorelines , bp is calling on clever non-experts to come up with solutions .
one sure option bp is putting a brave face on their current dilemma , which is bringing them tens of millions of dollars in new lawsuits , and costing them six million dollars -lrb- 4.6 million euros -rrb- in cleanup each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp 's 100-ton containment dome filled with ice crystals instead of funneling oil " i would n't say it 's failed yet , " said doug suttles , bp 's chief operating officer , the day after ice crystals clogged the containment dome .
" what i would say is , what we attempted to do last night did n't work . "
bp is considering using a smaller containment dome that will be less prone to clogging .
admiral thad allen , head of the us coast guard , also told cbs television that a type of plug was also being considered .
" they 're actually going to take a bunch of debris – shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that – and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up and stop the leak . "
however , experts warn that if such a procedure failed , it could cause the flow of the oil to increase exponentially .
the only sure option , geologist lorenz schwark told deutsche welle , is to drill a relief well to intercept the original well and to fill it with very heavy cement that would block the oil 's flow .
this process was used once in the gulf of mexico in 1979 ; at the time taking 10 months .
this time , he estimates , it will take about three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with no quick fix in sight , bp is looking for clever ideas from the public hair-brained schemes ?
publically flummoxed – and threatened by a drastic loss of face – bp has launched the website www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com to collect creative ideas from the general public on how to solve the spill .
submissions are then forwarded to engineers .
bp spokesperson bryan ferguson told reporters in louisiana that he had " no idea " to what extent these suggestions were being worked on , but said that bp had " flown in experts from around the world to collaborate and contemplate the ideas that are presented . "
most of the ideas being presented are probably not feasible , unfortunately .
professor schwark at the university of kiel said that he has received a number of emails himself in recent days from individuals wanting to present him their own ideas .
" most of them were quite drastic , including planting a nuclear device on the seafloor and just blowing up the whole area , " he said .
" i was wondering whether people do consider the effects of such an event if carried out under water in the real world , and not just in a comic film . "
a local initiative some initiatives led by non-experts are already underway along the threatened gulf shoreline .
in walton county , florida , sheriff michael a. adkinson unveiled his plan to protect 42 kilometers of white , sandy beaches .
adkinson has hired a private contractor to float several barges loaded with 1,400 pound -lrb- 635 kilogram -rrb- bales of hay into the gulf , which will then be shredded and blown onto the surface of the water , where he believes it will absorb the oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already doing damage to marine life , the spill threatens shorelines as well as for the source of the problem , schwark said , if his three-month estimation for relief efforts is correct and the oil flow remains constant , the amount spilled will total around 40 thousand tons , equal to the amount of oil leaked during the alaskan exxon-valdez disaster in 1989 – the biggest in us history to date .
schwark added that , given the 80-kilometer -lrb- 50-mile -rrb- distance from the shoreline in this case , he did n't think the overall environmental impact would be as devastating as in alaska .
said mary landry of the us coast guard , " i do n't think any of us know at this time what the impact will be on the environment , or the economic issues that are associated with this spill . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 10.05.2010 a bitter pill for the pill after 50 years in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women all over the world take the pill the 50th birthday of the birth control pill was celebrated on may 9 .
it has shaped population curves all over the world , but not in china , where it ca n't seem to catch on . half a century ago , in the year 1960 , a birth control pill by the name of " evonid " went onto the market in the usa – today , 50 years later , the pill is one of the most important forms of contraception .
it is very popular in europe but in china , on the other hand , it is not so wide-spread .
the birth control pill is stocked on the shelves in every pharmacy in china - right next to nasal spray and pain relievers .
a month 's supply costs just over two euros .
people in china do not need a doctor 's prescription to buy it ; women who are interested just ask a pharmacist .
one woman in a pharmacy in beijing says , " i do n't know what different kinds of pills there are .
i buy the one that the pharmacist suggests - the one with the least amount of side-effects . "
sexual emancipation - in the west when the pill went on the market in the usa in 1960 , china was quick to follow .
a few years later the country came out with its own contraceptive pills .
in the west , the pill was celebrated as sexual emancipation for women , but in china it was seen as merely a new form of contraception that could help slow down the rapid growth of the population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many young chinese women use the pill for contraception one woman from beijing remembers how the government propagated the pill .
she says , " in the beginning , our work units handed out the pill to us .
you could just go there and get it for free . "
despite being promoted by the government , the pill was never really accepted as a universal form of contraceptive in china , neither in the cities , nor in the country .
according to official chinese statistics , merely two to three percent of chinese women take the pill .
and even those numbers are dwindling .
' throws the body off balance ' women in beijing say they do n't like the pill 's side-effects .
one woman says , " the good thing about the pill is that it makes your skin nice and reduces acne , but it is also unhealthy .
i have heard it can cause vascular diseases in women over 40 and it is also not good for the heart . "
another woman agrees : " i used to take it , but only seldom .
taking the pill is primitive ; there are too many side-effects and it can cause damage to the body .
it throws the body off balance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six women who did n't take the pill - these ladies flaunt their bumps for the 2008 olympics other methods of contraception are preferred in china , like the contraceptive coil , condoms and plain " being careful " .
but because the latter is far from fool-proof , abortions are also very common .
they are carried out in normal hospitals or in private and often illegal clinics , where prices are very low , as are hygienic standards .
in a regular hospital , an abortion costs around 100 euros and getting an appointment is never a problem .
the patients do not need a doctor 's approval , nor consultation .
more and more young women get abortions , some even get many ; there is no talk of the psychological impact abortions can have .
china is one-of-a-kind in this respect .
it is not likely that china will ever change its policy and promote the pill over abortions .
discussions about the moral implications of killing an unborn child do not officially take place .

first there was the question whether germany even needed such a memorial and then what it should look like .
when american designer peter eisenman finally presented his design after considerable wrangling , the criticism came pouring in .
the memorial contained 2,711 concrete steles .
" too blockish , " complained the critics , " too abstract . "
they said it was just another drop zone for memorial wreaths , an adventure playground for teenaged antics .
a final stroke carved in stone for historical amnesiacs .
even an invitation for neo-nazi vandalism in the middle of berlin .
though the skepticism and concern were understandable , it has become clear over the five years of the monument 's existence that they were unnecessary . the field of pillars lies at the heart of berlin in quick walking distance to the brandenburg gate - arguably germany 's most famous national symbol .
open to visitors at all times , the memorial is not fenced off , there 's no entry fee , and it requires no more from its visitors than a willingness to engage with it .
the underground information center , which was added later , complements the abstract monument by giving the names of the victims and telling their tales of suffering .
some two million people have already visited the center ; many more have walked through the monument above .
even if it is just one more sight to see on their tour of berlin , the number of visitors the memorial receives daily testifies to the monument having become just as part of everyday life as it is part of germany 's larger culture of remembrance .
those who wish to learn more about the holocaust do n't have to look far .
the newly openend " topography of terror " - a sort of counterpart to the memorial - tells the story of the nazis ' crimes against humanity in explicit detail .
meanwhile , the memorial to europe 's murdered jews , remarkable for its abstraction and size , has become part of berlin 's historical landscape .
it is part of a germany-wide network of holocaust museums and memorials that so often commemorate victims ' individual fates .
one should not forget , as the memorial marks its fifth anniversary , that it was not something forced on the country from above or by the descendents of the victims .
nor did its conceptualization begin at an official level .
in fact , the idea was born twenty years ago in a citizens ' initiative spearheaded by journalist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
and so the monument is , in the best sense , a manifestation of personal dedication and historical conscience .
this memorial replaces neither live conversations with those who endured the holcaust , nor the private mourning of individuals .
and it certainly does n't absolve us from our responsibility of coming to terms with the holocaust , national-socialism and war in general in our schools , scholarship and society .
it is , however , an example of how intensively - after a long period of concealment and sugar-coating - germany is dealing with its nazi past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 10.05.2010 a bitter pill for the pill after 50 years in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women all over the world take the pill the 50th birthday of the birth control pill was celebrated on may 9 .
it has shaped population curves all over the world , but not in china , where it ca n't seem to catch on . half a century ago , in the year 1960 , a birth control pill by the name of " evonid " went onto the market in the usa – today , 50 years later , the pill is one of the most important forms of contraception .
it is very popular in europe but in china , on the other hand , it is not so wide-spread .
the birth control pill is stocked on the shelves in every pharmacy in china - right next to nasal spray and pain relievers .
a month 's supply costs just over two euros .
people in china do not need a doctor 's prescription to buy it ; women who are interested just ask a pharmacist .
one woman in a pharmacy in beijing says , " i do n't know what different kinds of pills there are .
i buy the one that the pharmacist suggests - the one with the least amount of side-effects . "
sexual emancipation - in the west when the pill went on the market in the usa in 1960 , china was quick to follow .
a few years later the country came out with its own contraceptive pills .
in the west , the pill was celebrated as sexual emancipation for women , but in china it was seen as merely a new form of contraception that could help slow down the rapid growth of the population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many young chinese women use the pill for contraception one woman from beijing remembers how the government propagated the pill .
she says , " in the beginning , our work units handed out the pill to us .
you could just go there and get it for free . "
despite being promoted by the government , the pill was never really accepted as a universal form of contraceptive in china , neither in the cities , nor in the country .
according to official chinese statistics , merely two to three percent of chinese women take the pill .
and even those numbers are dwindling .
' throws the body off balance ' women in beijing say they do n't like the pill 's side-effects .
one woman says , " the good thing about the pill is that it makes your skin nice and reduces acne , but it is also unhealthy .
i have heard it can cause vascular diseases in women over 40 and it is also not good for the heart . "
another woman agrees : " i used to take it , but only seldom .
taking the pill is primitive ; there are too many side-effects and it can cause damage to the body .
it throws the body off balance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six women who did n't take the pill - these ladies flaunt their bumps for the 2008 olympics other methods of contraception are preferred in china , like the contraceptive coil , condoms and plain " being careful " .
but because the latter is far from fool-proof , abortions are also very common .
they are carried out in normal hospitals or in private and often illegal clinics , where prices are very low , as are hygienic standards .
in a regular hospital , an abortion costs around 100 euros and getting an appointment is never a problem .
the patients do not need a doctor 's approval , nor consultation .
more and more young women get abortions , some even get many ; there is no talk of the psychological impact abortions can have .

it has shaped population curves all over the world , but not in china , where it ca n't seem to catch on . half a century ago , in the year 1960 , a birth control pill by the name of " evonid " went onto the market in the usa – today , 50 years later , the pill is one of the most important forms of contraception .
it is very popular in europe but in china , on the other hand , it is not so wide-spread .
the birth control pill is stocked on the shelves in every pharmacy in china - right next to nasal spray and pain relievers .
a month 's supply costs just over two euros .
people in china do not need a doctor 's prescription to buy it ; women who are interested just ask a pharmacist .
one woman in a pharmacy in beijing says , " i do n't know what different kinds of pills there are .
i buy the one that the pharmacist suggests - the one with the least amount of side-effects . "
sexual emancipation - in the west when the pill went on the market in the usa in 1960 , china was quick to follow .
a few years later the country came out with its own contraceptive pills .
in the west , the pill was celebrated as sexual emancipation for women , but in china it was seen as merely a new form of contraception that could help slow down the rapid growth of the population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many young chinese women use the pill for contraception one woman from beijing remembers how the government propagated the pill .
she says , " in the beginning , our work units handed out the pill to us .
you could just go there and get it for free . "
despite being promoted by the government , the pill was never really accepted as a universal form of contraceptive in china , neither in the cities , nor in the country .
according to official chinese statistics , merely two to three percent of chinese women take the pill .
and even those numbers are dwindling .
' throws the body off balance ' women in beijing say they do n't like the pill 's side-effects .
one woman says , " the good thing about the pill is that it makes your skin nice and reduces acne , but it is also unhealthy .
i have heard it can cause vascular diseases in women over 40 and it is also not good for the heart . "
another woman agrees : " i used to take it , but only seldom .
taking the pill is primitive ; there are too many side-effects and it can cause damage to the body .
it throws the body off balance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six women who did n't take the pill - these ladies flaunt their bumps for the 2008 olympics other methods of contraception are preferred in china , like the contraceptive coil , condoms and plain " being careful " .
but because the latter is far from fool-proof , abortions are also very common .
they are carried out in normal hospitals or in private and often illegal clinics , where prices are very low , as are hygienic standards .
in a regular hospital , an abortion costs around 100 euros and getting an appointment is never a problem .
the patients do not need a doctor 's approval , nor consultation .

it has shaped population curves all over the world , but not in china , where it ca n't seem to catch on . half a century ago , in the year 1960 , a birth control pill by the name of " evonid " went onto the market in the usa – today , 50 years later , the pill is one of the most important forms of contraception .
it is very popular in europe but in china , on the other hand , it is not so wide-spread .
the birth control pill is stocked on the shelves in every pharmacy in china - right next to nasal spray and pain relievers .
a month 's supply costs just over two euros .
people in china do not need a doctor 's prescription to buy it ; women who are interested just ask a pharmacist .
one woman in a pharmacy in beijing says , " i do n't know what different kinds of pills there are .
i buy the one that the pharmacist suggests - the one with the least amount of side-effects . "
sexual emancipation - in the west when the pill went on the market in the usa in 1960 , china was quick to follow .
a few years later the country came out with its own contraceptive pills .
in the west , the pill was celebrated as sexual emancipation for women , but in china it was seen as merely a new form of contraception that could help slow down the rapid growth of the population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many young chinese women use the pill for contraception one woman from beijing remembers how the government propagated the pill .
she says , " in the beginning , our work units handed out the pill to us .
you could just go there and get it for free . "
despite being promoted by the government , the pill was never really accepted as a universal form of contraceptive in china , neither in the cities , nor in the country .
according to official chinese statistics , merely two to three percent of chinese women take the pill .
and even those numbers are dwindling .
' throws the body off balance ' women in beijing say they do n't like the pill 's side-effects .
one woman says , " the good thing about the pill is that it makes your skin nice and reduces acne , but it is also unhealthy .
i have heard it can cause vascular diseases in women over 40 and it is also not good for the heart . "
another woman agrees : " i used to take it , but only seldom .
taking the pill is primitive ; there are too many side-effects and it can cause damage to the body .
it throws the body off balance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six women who did n't take the pill - these ladies flaunt their bumps for the 2008 olympics other methods of contraception are preferred in china , like the contraceptive coil , condoms and plain " being careful " .
but because the latter is far from fool-proof , abortions are also very common .
they are carried out in normal hospitals or in private and often illegal clinics , where prices are very low , as are hygienic standards .
in a regular hospital , an abortion costs around 100 euros and getting an appointment is never a problem .
the patients do not need a doctor 's approval , nor consultation .
more and more young women get abortions , some even get many ; there is no talk of the psychological impact abortions can have .
china is one-of-a-kind in this respect .
it is not likely that china will ever change its policy and promote the pill over abortions .
discussions about the moral implications of killing an unborn child do not officially take place .

first there was the question whether germany even needed such a memorial and then what it should look like .
when american designer peter eisenman finally presented his design after considerable wrangling , the criticism came pouring in .
the memorial contained 2,711 concrete steles .
" too blockish , " complained the critics , " too abstract . "
they said it was just another drop zone for memorial wreaths , an adventure playground for teenaged antics .
a final stroke carved in stone for historical amnesiacs .
even an invitation for neo-nazi vandalism in the middle of berlin .
though the skepticism and concern were understandable , it has become clear over the five years of the monument 's existence that they were unnecessary . the field of pillars lies at the heart of berlin in quick walking distance to the brandenburg gate - arguably germany 's most famous national symbol .
open to visitors at all times , the memorial is not fenced off , there 's no entry fee , and it requires no more from its visitors than a willingness to engage with it .
the underground information center , which was added later , complements the abstract monument by giving the names of the victims and telling their tales of suffering .
some two million people have already visited the center ; many more have walked through the monument above .
even if it is just one more sight to see on their tour of berlin , the number of visitors the memorial receives daily testifies to the monument having become just as part of everyday life as it is part of germany 's larger culture of remembrance .
those who wish to learn more about the holocaust do n't have to look far .
the newly openend " topography of terror " - a sort of counterpart to the memorial - tells the story of the nazis ' crimes against humanity in explicit detail .
meanwhile , the memorial to europe 's murdered jews , remarkable for its abstraction and size , has become part of berlin 's historical landscape .
it is part of a germany-wide network of holocaust museums and memorials that so often commemorate victims ' individual fates .
one should not forget , as the memorial marks its fifth anniversary , that it was not something forced on the country from above or by the descendents of the victims .
nor did its conceptualization begin at an official level .
in fact , the idea was born twenty years ago in a citizens ' initiative spearheaded by journalist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
and so the monument is , in the best sense , a manifestation of personal dedication and historical conscience .
this memorial replaces neither live conversations with those who endured the holcaust , nor the private mourning of individuals .
and it certainly does n't absolve us from our responsibility of coming to terms with the holocaust , national-socialism and war in general in our schools , scholarship and society .
it is , however , an example of how intensively - after a long period of concealment and sugar-coating - germany is dealing with its nazi past .

open to visitors at all times , the memorial is not fenced off , there 's no entry fee , and it requires no more from its visitors than a willingness to engage with it .
the underground information center , which was added later , complements the abstract monument by giving the names of the victims and telling their tales of suffering .
some two million people have already visited the center ; many more have walked through the monument above .
even if it is just one more sight to see on their tour of berlin , the number of visitors the memorial receives daily testifies to the monument having become just as part of everyday life as it is part of germany 's larger culture of remembrance .
those who wish to learn more about the holocaust do n't have to look far .
the newly openend " topography of terror " - a sort of counterpart to the memorial - tells the story of the nazis ' crimes against humanity in explicit detail .
meanwhile , the memorial to europe 's murdered jews , remarkable for its abstraction and size , has become part of berlin 's historical landscape .
it is part of a germany-wide network of holocaust museums and memorials that so often commemorate victims ' individual fates .
one should not forget , as the memorial marks its fifth anniversary , that it was not something forced on the country from above or by the descendents of the victims .
nor did its conceptualization begin at an official level .
in fact , the idea was born twenty years ago in a citizens ' initiative spearheaded by journalist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
and so the monument is , in the best sense , a manifestation of personal dedication and historical conscience .
this memorial replaces neither live conversations with those who endured the holcaust , nor the private mourning of individuals .
and it certainly does n't absolve us from our responsibility of coming to terms with the holocaust , national-socialism and war in general in our schools , scholarship and society .
it is , however , an example of how intensively - after a long period of concealment and sugar-coating - germany is dealing with its nazi past .

british elections last thursday resulted in a hung parliament , with neither of the major parties - center-left labour and the center-right conservatives - winning a majority in parliament .
nick clegg 's liberal democrat party came in third , allowing it to take on a kingmaker role for whichever of the major parties it chooses to form a coalition with .
the centrist lib dems spent the past three days holding coalition talks with the conservatives , led by david cameron .
brown 's announcement that he would " play no part " in the selection of the next labour leader came as a surprise .
brown said it was " in the interests of the whole country to form a progressive coalition government . "
" the reason we have a hung parliament is that no single party and no single leader was able to win the full support of the country , " brown said .
" as leader of my party , i must accept that that is a judgment on me . "

the red shirts hold suthep responsible for a clash with soldiers which left 25 people dead on april 10 , as he was in charge of security matters at that time .
suthep has denied responsibility for the deadly clash that was triggered by an unsuccessful attempt to remove the protesters by force .
but a government spokesman said suthep has agreed to meet investigators on tuesday to hear the accusations against him .
bargaining for bail thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva proposed a peace " road map " last week , which includes the dissolution of parliament in the second half of september and fresh elections on november 14 , as well as proposals for political reforms .
he also issued an ultimatum to the protesters , demanding they reply to his offer by monday , may 10 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red shirts will not end their protests for the time being the red shirts , supporters of the exiled former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , in turn also put forward several other demands , including a reopening of their tv channel .
observers believe they are reluctant to vacate their encampments because they fear legal repercussions for their partly violent protests .
their demand for suthep to turn himself in has been seen as an attempt to strike a bargain with the government to be assured bail once they end the protests. tb / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw looks at the memorial 's past , present and future . in 1953 - in the wake of the holocaust - a first order of business for the young israeli state was the construction of the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem .
forty years later , washington , d.c. built its holocaust memorial .
yet it was n't until 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii , that germany , the atrocity 's perpetrator , unveiled its memorial to the murdered jews of europe . it 's been five years since the holocaust memorial opened at the center of berlin .
support and appreciation for the monument - which caused 13 years of heated debate and may now be disintegrating - is stronger than ever . a grassroots proposal the idea for the memorial first came at the beginning of 1989 through a citizens ' initiative in berlin , spearheaded by journalist and publicist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
the group wanted to see a national memorial to the jews who perished in the holocaust built in berlin , which was the capital of east germany at the time . with the fall of the berlin wall a few months later and the excitement of germany 's reunification shortly thereafter , the idea was almost immediately placed on the backburner .
a few years later , in 1992 , chancellor helmut kohl 's government became proponents of the memorial 's construction and set aside space for it next to berlin 's brandenburg gate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect peter eisenman says he could n't have done it without rosh 's support in bonn , still the capital of west germany , many parliamentarians fought for the monument to be built .
among them was christian democrat norbert lammert , who is now head of the memorial 's curatorial committee . lammert says that he and several others " emphatically advocated that the government 's move to berlin after reunification needed to begin with such a demonstrative sign . " but the monument itself would not be realized for quite some time .
after rounds of hearings , debates , competitions and exhibitions , the german parliament finally decided to create a foundation to decide on and implement a design for the memorial . throughout this process and the further debates that ensued , the memorial 's conceptualists , rosh and jaeckel , remained clear on what they wanted their brainchild to accomplish .
" we wanted the memorial to do three things , " rosh told deutsche welle : " to commemorate what took place , to honor the victims and to give them back their names . " the fruits of a long labor today , the monument does just that .
spreading over 19,000 square meters -lrb- over 200,000 square feet -rrb- in the middle of berlin , the memorial to the murdered jews of europe is made up of 2,711 gray , concrete steles of varying heights - a seemingly endless landscape of concrete waves that ca n't be overlooked . some critics found the monument too abstract and anonymous , so an information center was later added beneath the terrain , where visitors can learn about the holocaust and its victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial , located at the heart of berlin , is facing serious renovation the monument 's designer , american architect peter eisenman , has not been back to the memorial since its opening in may 2005 , and was originally against the addition of the information center .
now , he is more pleased than ever with his work . " it 's unusual for an american to sit here and say , it was my intention to give you back your memory , " eisenman said .
" it sounds rather condescending , but i think if i had been german , i would have done it and perceived it in the same way . " it was n't an easy road for eisenman ; the memorial that was finally constructed was the second proposal , after the large-scale sculptor richard serra backed out of the project . " i 'm very proud of what we accomplished .
we encountered a great deal of disputes and setbacks .
but lea rosh kept us from giving up , and step by step we got there .
by now , those difficulties have faded into history .
now it 's about the present and the future . looking forward the monument 's future is not fully unproblematic .
recently , faulty construction has begun taking a toll on the concrete pillars , and renovation or partial reconstruction will soon become urgently necessary . uwe neumaerker , the director of the memorial foundation , told deutsche welle he does not know how long the process will take , adding that " tests have shown that unfortunately it will take a very long time . "
still , neumaerker assures that " nothing will fall apart . " more likely than the memorial 's concrete steles falling on visitors , it seems , is visitors falling off steles .

the site , near the kosovo border , was " more proof that serbia does not shy away from its dark past and is ready to bring to justice all those who have committed crimes , " said prosecutor vladimir vukcevic .
during the two-year conflict , serb forces controlled by former strongman slobodan milosevic transported the remains of hundreds of ethnic albanian civilians to several locations in serbia in a bid to cover up mass killings and war crimes .
in 2001 , the remains of more than 830 kosovo albanians were found at three sites in serbia .
over 700 bodies have since been uncovered in a mass grave located in a suburb of the capital , belgrade .
dozens more were found in the towns of petrovo selo and perucac .
the exhumation of bodies from the raska site is expected to begin soon when an evaluation of the crime scene is completed .
a former top police official and serbian deputy interior minister during the kosovo conflict , vlastimir djordjevic , is believed to have ordered the vast cover-up .
djordjevic is currently standing trial at the un war crimes tribunal in the hague. gb / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.05.2010 world markets rise on news of measures to stabilize the eurozone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro shot up in trading against the dollar monday international markets reacted positively to the creation of a eurozone-stabilization package .
the funds will be used to rescue any eurozone country that gets into serious financial difficulty . news of the proposed eurozone stability package saw markets rise worldwide on monday , which was just the sort of reaction that european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund had hoped for .
frankfurt 's dax closed the day up 5.3 percent , london 's ftse 100 index ended the day up 5.16 percent , while in paris , the cac-40 soared to close up by 9.66 percent .
in new york , the dow jones jumped by more than four percent in early trading .
the euro shot up by 1.5 cents against the us dollar after the announcement of the deal , then fell slightly to 1.28 dollars as the markets waited to see if member nations would follow through with austerity measures .
this followed a 14-month low against the dollar last week , amid uncertainty that the bloc would rescue greece , spain and portugal from possible default . the markets were reacting to an announcement made by european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund in brussels early on monday , that they had agreed on the creation of permanent measures worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 964 billion -rrb- to bail out eurozone states that run into financial difficulty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has already secured a 110 billion-euro loan package from the eurozone and the imf under the plan , the european commission is to provide 60 billion euros , while members of the 16-nation eurozone have pledged 440 billion euros to the fund .
the imf is to contribute an additional 250 billion euros , said spanish finance minister elena salgado .
german chancellor angela merkel said that the nearly trillion-dollar package would serve to " strengthen and protect " the euro .
she said that the eurozone must actively resolve its stability problem " at the roots " by pressing member states to balance their budgets .
" budget consolidation in all member states is extraordinarily important , " said merkel .
the chancellor also welcomed new austerity measures promised by the spanish government , saying they send an important message to the markets .
washington has praised europe 's stabilization plans . one white house official said president barack obama supports " assertive action " to address the greek debt crisis , and that european leaders have his support .
calming the markets the european commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , olli rehn , said the massive bailout " proves that we will defend the euro , whatever it takes . "
the european central bank will also implement exceptional measures in support of the package , the eu 's top economic official said on monday .
international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn hailed the package as a big step forward , and said the imf would be happy to contribute should eurozone countries require additional help from beyond the european central bank .
calming the fears of international markets appears to be the main goal of the package , but swedish finance minister anders borg described the situation more bluntly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets seem to approve of the eurozone measures " we now see herd behavior in the markets that is really pack behavior , wolf pack behavior , " borg told reporters .
" if we will not stop these packs , they will tear the weaker countries apart . "
meanwhile , britain 's chancellor of the exchequer , alistair darling , said the package was a " good deal " for europe , and that it was in the best interests of britain 's banks and export market .
however , darling did make it clear that this was a problem for the eurogroup .
" what we ca n't do is provide support for the euro , " said darling .
" that 's got to be for those countries that use the euro that are members of the eurogroup . "
awkward timing the euro stabilization deal comes just as state elections in germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , have taken away merkel 's majority in the upper house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disapproval of the greek bailout could have been one of the factors to the cdu 's majority loss the results of the election in north rhine-westphalia were seen by some as a reaction to merkel 's reluctant support of the eu 's greek bailout , which is unpopular with many voters in germany .
nevertheless , merkel stressed the measures were needed to protect the euro and german incomes .
" it is the first time in the history of the euro and the eu , and we are protecting our currency in an extraordinary situation , " said merkel .
" i can also put it this way to the population : we are protecting the money of the people in germany . "
the european commission is planning to meet on wednesday to determine how to strengthen eu budget rules and economic surveillance in the eurozone to avoid a future crisis. mk / gb / apf / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the funds will be used to rescue any eurozone country that gets into serious financial difficulty . news of the proposed eurozone stability package saw markets rise worldwide on monday , which was just the sort of reaction that european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund had hoped for .
frankfurt 's dax closed the day up 5.3 percent , london 's ftse 100 index ended the day up 5.16 percent , while in paris , the cac-40 soared to close up by 9.66 percent .
in new york , the dow jones jumped by more than four percent in early trading .
the euro shot up by 1.5 cents against the us dollar after the announcement of the deal , then fell slightly to 1.28 dollars as the markets waited to see if member nations would follow through with austerity measures .
this followed a 14-month low against the dollar last week , amid uncertainty that the bloc would rescue greece , spain and portugal from possible default . the markets were reacting to an announcement made by european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund in brussels early on monday , that they had agreed on the creation of permanent measures worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 964 billion -rrb- to bail out eurozone states that run into financial difficulty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has already secured a 110 billion-euro loan package from the eurozone and the imf under the plan , the european commission is to provide 60 billion euros , while members of the 16-nation eurozone have pledged 440 billion euros to the fund .
the imf is to contribute an additional 250 billion euros , said spanish finance minister elena salgado .
german chancellor angela merkel said that the nearly trillion-dollar package would serve to " strengthen and protect " the euro .
she said that the eurozone must actively resolve its stability problem " at the roots " by pressing member states to balance their budgets .
" budget consolidation in all member states is extraordinarily important , " said merkel .
the chancellor also welcomed new austerity measures promised by the spanish government , saying they send an important message to the markets .
washington has praised europe 's stabilization plans . one white house official said president barack obama supports " assertive action " to address the greek debt crisis , and that european leaders have his support .
calming the markets the european commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , olli rehn , said the massive bailout " proves that we will defend the euro , whatever it takes . "
the european central bank will also implement exceptional measures in support of the package , the eu 's top economic official said on monday .
international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn hailed the package as a big step forward , and said the imf would be happy to contribute should eurozone countries require additional help from beyond the european central bank .
calming the fears of international markets appears to be the main goal of the package , but swedish finance minister anders borg described the situation more bluntly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets seem to approve of the eurozone measures " we now see herd behavior in the markets that is really pack behavior , wolf pack behavior , " borg told reporters .
" if we will not stop these packs , they will tear the weaker countries apart . "
meanwhile , britain 's chancellor of the exchequer , alistair darling , said the package was a " good deal " for europe , and that it was in the best interests of britain 's banks and export market .
however , darling did make it clear that this was a problem for the eurogroup .
" what we ca n't do is provide support for the euro , " said darling .
" that 's got to be for those countries that use the euro that are members of the eurogroup . "
awkward timing the euro stabilization deal comes just as state elections in germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , have taken away merkel 's majority in the upper house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disapproval of the greek bailout could have been one of the factors to the cdu 's majority loss the results of the election in north rhine-westphalia were seen by some as a reaction to merkel 's reluctant support of the eu 's greek bailout , which is unpopular with many voters in germany .
nevertheless , merkel stressed the measures were needed to protect the euro and german incomes .
" it is the first time in the history of the euro and the eu , and we are protecting our currency in an extraordinary situation , " said merkel .
" i can also put it this way to the population : we are protecting the money of the people in germany . "
the european commission is planning to meet on wednesday to determine how to strengthen eu budget rules and economic surveillance in the eurozone to avoid a future crisis. mk / gb / apf / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

first there was the question whether germany even needed such a memorial and then what it should look like .
when american designer peter eisenman finally presented his design after considerable wrangling , the criticism came pouring in .
the memorial contained 2,711 concrete steles .
" too blockish , " complained the critics , " too abstract . "
they said it was just another drop zone for memorial wreaths , an adventure playground for teenaged antics .
a final stroke carved in stone for historical amnesiacs .
even an invitation for neo-nazi vandalism in the middle of berlin .
though the skepticism and concern were understandable , it has become clear over the five years of the monument 's existence that they were unnecessary . the field of pillars lies at the heart of berlin in quick walking distance to the brandenburg gate - arguably germany 's most famous national symbol .
open to visitors at all times , the memorial is not fenced off , there 's no entry fee , and it requires no more from its visitors than a willingness to engage with it .
the underground information center , which was added later , complements the abstract monument by giving the names of the victims and telling their tales of suffering .
some two million people have already visited the center ; many more have walked through the monument above .
even if it is just one more sight to see on their tour of berlin , the number of visitors the memorial receives daily testifies to the monument having become just as part of everyday life as it is part of germany 's larger culture of remembrance .
those who wish to learn more about the holocaust do n't have to look far .
the newly openend " topography of terror " - a sort of counterpart to the memorial - tells the story of the nazis ' crimes against humanity in explicit detail .
meanwhile , the memorial to europe 's murdered jews , remarkable for its abstraction and size , has become part of berlin 's historical landscape .
it is part of a germany-wide network of holocaust museums and memorials that so often commemorate victims ' individual fates .
one should not forget , as the memorial marks its fifth anniversary , that it was not something forced on the country from above or by the descendents of the victims .
nor did its conceptualization begin at an official level .
in fact , the idea was born twenty years ago in a citizens ' initiative spearheaded by journalist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
and so the monument is , in the best sense , a manifestation of personal dedication and historical conscience .
this memorial replaces neither live conversations with those who endured the holcaust , nor the private mourning of individuals .
and it certainly does n't absolve us from our responsibility of coming to terms with the holocaust , national-socialism and war in general in our schools , scholarship and society .
it is , however , an example of how intensively - after a long period of concealment and sugar-coating - germany is dealing with its nazi past .

the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were only marginally behind , winning 34.5 percent of the vote . the business-friendly free democrats , the cdu 's current coalition partner in north rhine-westphalia and at the national level , gained half a percentage point , winning 6.7 percent of the vote .
the environmentalist greens did the best , almost doubling their showing from the last state election , securing 12.1 percent .
the left party won 5.6 percent , and is now poised to enter the nrw state parliament for the first time .
the election outcome means that the opposition social democrats and the green party could narrowly form a governing coalition in germany 's most populous state with a slim one-vote majority , but would likely require support from the left party . the alternatives are a coalition between the cdu and the greens , a grand coalition of spd and cdu , a so-called ' jamaica ' alliance between the cdu , greens and fdp , or a ' traffic light ' coalition between the spd , greens and fdp .
a failed test the nrw state election was the first litmus test for chancellor merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp government . the loss in north rhine-westphalia has cost her government its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
the debacle in nrw will make it considerably harder for merkel to push through parliament key reforms and tax cuts needed to revitalize europe 's largest economy .
the election comes just days after the german bundestag approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
" this is a bitter defeat for the cdu in the state and federally , " gerd langguth , political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency . " it is also an object lesson for the performance of the federal government , especially for the fdp , " he added . " the greek aid package also had an effect .
people are n't happy about germany being europe 's paymaster , " he said . results that ca n't be ignored spd and green leaders took the election results as a sign of bigger changes to come in the country 's political landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft celebrates with other spd members " the spd is back ! "
social democrat candidate hannelore kraft told supporters as the first results came in . " an spd-green alliance is what north rhine-westphalia wants ! "
the co-chair of the greens , claudia roth , said the vote was the payback for the government 's decisions in berlin .
" for the federal cdu-fdp coalition , my friends , this is the beginning of the end , " she said .
a leading member of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach , also said the loss for the conservatives was a sign of bigger issues .
" i can only warn the cdu against trying to put a positive spin on this result , " he said .
" it is a huge disappointment . "
according to german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who also leads the fdp , the coalition government wo n't ignore these results , describing them as a " warning shot " by voters .
" citizens need to know that we have heard their message , " he said .

those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .
no-names were the stars bildunterschrift : klose had a lot of time for rest and reflection this season the mvp of the season was arjen robben , who brought a whole new level of class to the bundesliga , but otherwise this was not a good year for marquee players .
at bayern , van gaal decided he could largely live without luca toni , miroslav klose , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuck , whose services had cost bayern at least 66 million euros -lrb- $ 86 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .
they 'll be playing in the champions league next season .
cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .
comedies of errors bildunterschrift : burchert learned the hard way about the risks of coming out of goal 2009-10 will also be remembered as the year established clubs found new and innovative ways to lose .
no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .
in fact , sometimes german football resembled professional wrestling , with a variety of objects being enlisted to help individuals express their dissatisfaction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero 's aim , in this instance , was good in bochum , a security official was clobbered with a chair , as fans realized they , too , had been relegated .
and down in the second division , hansa rostock supporters hit their own goalkeeper with a tossed firecracker .
but one player fought back .
hamburg striker paolo guerrero beaned a supporter with a water bottle after some unappreciated criticism .
it was one of peruvian 's rare appearances - he missed 28 games due to injury , fear of flying and suspension .
" when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro , " wrote the late , great hunter s. thompson .
but 2009-10 was a year in which once the season got going , the pros turned weird .

the funds will be used to rescue any eurozone country that gets into serious financial difficulty . news of the proposed eurozone stability package saw markets rise worldwide on monday , which was just the sort of reaction that european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund had hoped for .
frankfurt 's dax closed the day up 5.3 percent , london 's ftse 100 index ended the day up 5.16 percent , while in paris , the cac-40 soared to close up by 9.66 percent .
in new york , the dow jones jumped by more than four percent in early trading .
the euro shot up by 1.5 cents against the us dollar after the announcement of the deal , then fell slightly to 1.28 dollars as the markets waited to see if member nations would follow through with austerity measures .
this followed a 14-month low against the dollar last week , amid uncertainty that the bloc would rescue greece , spain and portugal from possible default . the markets were reacting to an announcement made by european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund in brussels early on monday , that they had agreed on the creation of permanent measures worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 964 billion -rrb- to bail out eurozone states that run into financial difficulty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has already secured a 110 billion-euro loan package from the eurozone and the imf under the plan , the european commission is to provide 60 billion euros , while members of the 16-nation eurozone have pledged 440 billion euros to the fund .
the imf is to contribute an additional 250 billion euros , said spanish finance minister elena salgado .
german chancellor angela merkel said that the nearly trillion-dollar package would serve to " strengthen and protect " the euro .
she said that the eurozone must actively resolve its stability problem " at the roots " by pressing member states to balance their budgets .
" budget consolidation in all member states is extraordinarily important , " said merkel .
the chancellor also welcomed new austerity measures promised by the spanish government , saying they send an important message to the markets .
washington has praised europe 's stabilization plans . one white house official said president barack obama supports " assertive action " to address the greek debt crisis , and that european leaders have his support .
calming the markets the european commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , olli rehn , said the massive bailout " proves that we will defend the euro , whatever it takes . "
the european central bank will also implement exceptional measures in support of the package , the eu 's top economic official said on monday .
international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn hailed the package as a big step forward , and said the imf would be happy to contribute should eurozone countries require additional help from beyond the european central bank .
calming the fears of international markets appears to be the main goal of the package , but swedish finance minister anders borg described the situation more bluntly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets seem to approve of the eurozone measures " we now see herd behavior in the markets that is really pack behavior , wolf pack behavior , " borg told reporters .
" if we will not stop these packs , they will tear the weaker countries apart . "
meanwhile , britain 's chancellor of the exchequer , alistair darling , said the package was a " good deal " for europe , and that it was in the best interests of britain 's banks and export market .
however , darling did make it clear that this was a problem for the eurogroup .
" what we ca n't do is provide support for the euro , " said darling .
" that 's got to be for those countries that use the euro that are members of the eurogroup . "
awkward timing the euro stabilization deal comes just as state elections in germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , have taken away merkel 's majority in the upper house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disapproval of the greek bailout could have been one of the factors to the cdu 's majority loss the results of the election in north rhine-westphalia were seen by some as a reaction to merkel 's reluctant support of the eu 's greek bailout , which is unpopular with many voters in germany .
nevertheless , merkel stressed the measures were needed to protect the euro and german incomes .
" it is the first time in the history of the euro and the eu , and we are protecting our currency in an extraordinary situation , " said merkel .
" i can also put it this way to the population : we are protecting the money of the people in germany . "

the funds will be used to rescue any eurozone country that gets into serious financial difficulty . news of the proposed eurozone stability package saw markets rise worldwide on monday , which was just the sort of reaction that european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund had hoped for .
frankfurt 's dax closed the day up 5.3 percent , london 's ftse 100 index ended the day up 5.16 percent , while in paris , the cac-40 soared to close up by 9.66 percent .
in new york , the dow jones jumped by more than four percent in early trading .
the euro shot up by 1.5 cents against the us dollar after the announcement of the deal , then fell slightly to 1.28 dollars as the markets waited to see if member nations would follow through with austerity measures .
this followed a 14-month low against the dollar last week , amid uncertainty that the bloc would rescue greece , spain and portugal from possible default . the markets were reacting to an announcement made by european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund in brussels early on monday , that they had agreed on the creation of permanent measures worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 964 billion -rrb- to bail out eurozone states that run into financial difficulty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has already secured a 110 billion-euro loan package from the eurozone and the imf under the plan , the european commission is to provide 60 billion euros , while members of the 16-nation eurozone have pledged 440 billion euros to the fund .
the imf is to contribute an additional 250 billion euros , said spanish finance minister elena salgado .
german chancellor angela merkel said that the nearly trillion-dollar package would serve to " strengthen and protect " the euro .
she said that the eurozone must actively resolve its stability problem " at the roots " by pressing member states to balance their budgets .
" budget consolidation in all member states is extraordinarily important , " said merkel .
the chancellor also welcomed new austerity measures promised by the spanish government , saying they send an important message to the markets .
washington has praised europe 's stabilization plans . one white house official said president barack obama supports " assertive action " to address the greek debt crisis , and that european leaders have his support .
calming the markets the european commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , olli rehn , said the massive bailout " proves that we will defend the euro , whatever it takes . "
the european central bank will also implement exceptional measures in support of the package , the eu 's top economic official said on monday .
international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn hailed the package as a big step forward , and said the imf would be happy to contribute should eurozone countries require additional help from beyond the european central bank .
calming the fears of international markets appears to be the main goal of the package , but swedish finance minister anders borg described the situation more bluntly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets seem to approve of the eurozone measures " we now see herd behavior in the markets that is really pack behavior , wolf pack behavior , " borg told reporters .
" if we will not stop these packs , they will tear the weaker countries apart . "
meanwhile , britain 's chancellor of the exchequer , alistair darling , said the package was a " good deal " for europe , and that it was in the best interests of britain 's banks and export market .
however , darling did make it clear that this was a problem for the eurogroup .
" what we ca n't do is provide support for the euro , " said darling .
" that 's got to be for those countries that use the euro that are members of the eurogroup . "
awkward timing the euro stabilization deal comes just as state elections in germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , have taken away merkel 's majority in the upper house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disapproval of the greek bailout could have been one of the factors to the cdu 's majority loss the results of the election in north rhine-westphalia were seen by some as a reaction to merkel 's reluctant support of the eu 's greek bailout , which is unpopular with many voters in germany .
nevertheless , merkel stressed the measures were needed to protect the euro and german incomes .
" it is the first time in the history of the euro and the eu , and we are protecting our currency in an extraordinary situation , " said merkel .
" i can also put it this way to the population : we are protecting the money of the people in germany . "
the european commission is planning to meet on wednesday to determine how to strengthen eu budget rules and economic surveillance in the eurozone to avoid a future crisis. mk / gb / apf / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 10.05.2010 five years on , berlin holocaust memorial is a landmark of remembrance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin holocaust memorial was a long time in the making now five years old , berlin 's holocaust memorial serves as a landmark of remembrance and a symbol of collective conscience - even as the structure threatens to crumble .
dw looks at the memorial 's past , present and future . in 1953 - in the wake of the holocaust - a first order of business for the young israeli state was the construction of the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem .
forty years later , washington , d.c. built its holocaust memorial .
yet it was n't until 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii , that germany , the atrocity 's perpetrator , unveiled its memorial to the murdered jews of europe . it 's been five years since the holocaust memorial opened at the center of berlin .
support and appreciation for the monument - which caused 13 years of heated debate and may now be disintegrating - is stronger than ever . a grassroots proposal the idea for the memorial first came at the beginning of 1989 through a citizens ' initiative in berlin , spearheaded by journalist and publicist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
the group wanted to see a national memorial to the jews who perished in the holocaust built in berlin , which was the capital of east germany at the time . with the fall of the berlin wall a few months later and the excitement of germany 's reunification shortly thereafter , the idea was almost immediately placed on the backburner .
a few years later , in 1992 , chancellor helmut kohl 's government became proponents of the memorial 's construction and set aside space for it next to berlin 's brandenburg gate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect peter eisenman says he could n't have done it without rosh 's support in bonn , still the capital of west germany , many parliamentarians fought for the monument to be built .
among them was christian democrat norbert lammert , who is now head of the memorial 's curatorial committee . lammert says that he and several others " emphatically advocated that the government 's move to berlin after reunification needed to begin with such a demonstrative sign . " but the monument itself would not be realized for quite some time .
after rounds of hearings , debates , competitions and exhibitions , the german parliament finally decided to create a foundation to decide on and implement a design for the memorial . throughout this process and the further debates that ensued , the memorial 's conceptualists , rosh and jaeckel , remained clear on what they wanted their brainchild to accomplish .
" we wanted the memorial to do three things , " rosh told deutsche welle : " to commemorate what took place , to honor the victims and to give them back their names . " the fruits of a long labor today , the monument does just that .
spreading over 19,000 square meters -lrb- over 200,000 square feet -rrb- in the middle of berlin , the memorial to the murdered jews of europe is made up of 2,711 gray , concrete steles of varying heights - a seemingly endless landscape of concrete waves that ca n't be overlooked . some critics found the monument too abstract and anonymous , so an information center was later added beneath the terrain , where visitors can learn about the holocaust and its victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial , located at the heart of berlin , is facing serious renovation the monument 's designer , american architect peter eisenman , has not been back to the memorial since its opening in may 2005 , and was originally against the addition of the information center .
now , he is more pleased than ever with his work . " it 's unusual for an american to sit here and say , it was my intention to give you back your memory , " eisenman said .
" it sounds rather condescending , but i think if i had been german , i would have done it and perceived it in the same way . " it was n't an easy road for eisenman ; the memorial that was finally constructed was the second proposal , after the large-scale sculptor richard serra backed out of the project . " i 'm very proud of what we accomplished .
we encountered a great deal of disputes and setbacks .
but lea rosh kept us from giving up , and step by step we got there .
by now , those difficulties have faded into history .
now it 's about the present and the future . looking forward the monument 's future is not fully unproblematic .
recently , faulty construction has begun taking a toll on the concrete pillars , and renovation or partial reconstruction will soon become urgently necessary . uwe neumaerker , the director of the memorial foundation , told deutsche welle he does not know how long the process will take , adding that " tests have shown that unfortunately it will take a very long time . "
still , neumaerker assures that " nothing will fall apart . " more likely than the memorial 's concrete steles falling on visitors , it seems , is visitors falling off steles .
the monument has become a popular destination for games of hide-and-seek , parkour daredevils and sun-worshippers that come on warm days to enjoy the shade-free tops of the steles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial is sometimes used for other purposes rosh takes a relatively relaxed stance toward visitors repurposing her memorial . " sometimes i go and see people sunning themselves on the steles and tell them that there are lawns for sunbathing in the tiergarten just across the street , " she said .
" i tell the boys who are hopping around on the steles that they should do that somewhere else . " when i tell the eight- to 12-year-olds that they should go into the information center below the memorial and then come talk to me about it , it 's always very powerful .
they tell me they 've learned a lot . " author : marcel fuerstenau -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the site , near the kosovo border , was " more proof that serbia does not shy away from its dark past and is ready to bring to justice all those who have committed crimes , " said prosecutor vladimir vukcevic .
during the two-year conflict , serb forces controlled by former strongman slobodan milosevic transported the remains of hundreds of ethnic albanian civilians to several locations in serbia in a bid to cover up mass killings and war crimes .
in 2001 , the remains of more than 830 kosovo albanians were found at three sites in serbia .
over 700 bodies have since been uncovered in a mass grave located in a suburb of the capital , belgrade .
dozens more were found in the towns of petrovo selo and perucac .
the exhumation of bodies from the raska site is expected to begin soon when an evaluation of the crime scene is completed .
a former top police official and serbian deputy interior minister during the kosovo conflict , vlastimir djordjevic , is believed to have ordered the vast cover-up .
djordjevic is currently standing trial at the un war crimes tribunal in the hague. gb / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 10.05.2010 oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slick began hitting us shores late last week bp 's 100-ton containment dome failed to funnel oil leaks that have been polluting the gulf of mexico for over two weeks .
as the slick reaches us shores , bp wants you to come up with a solution . the 100-ton containment dome that bp hoped would stop an ongoing oil spill into the gulf of mexico , has failed after clogging with ice crystals .
the dome , which was lowered to the seafloor last thursday , was meant to funnel leaking crude into a rigger .
the oil has been shooting into the gulf at a rate of 5,000 barrels -lrb- 210,000 gallons -rrb- per day , since an april 20 explosion off the coast of louisiana that left 11 missing and presumably dead .
with no quick fix in sight now and the oil slick reaching shorelines , bp is calling on clever non-experts to come up with solutions .
one sure option bp is putting a brave face on their current dilemma , which is bringing them tens of millions of dollars in new lawsuits , and costing them six million dollars -lrb- 4.6 million euros -rrb- in cleanup each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp 's 100-ton containment dome filled with ice crystals instead of funneling oil " i would n't say it 's failed yet , " said doug suttles , bp 's chief operating officer , the day after ice crystals clogged the containment dome .
" what i would say is , what we attempted to do last night did n't work . "
bp is considering using a smaller containment dome that will be less prone to clogging .
admiral thad allen , head of the us coast guard , also told cbs television that a type of plug was also being considered .
" they 're actually going to take a bunch of debris – shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that – and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up and stop the leak . "
however , experts warn that if such a procedure failed , it could cause the flow of the oil to increase exponentially .
the only sure option , geologist lorenz schwark told deutsche welle , is to drill a relief well to intercept the original well and to fill it with very heavy cement that would block the oil 's flow .
this process was used once in the gulf of mexico in 1979 ; at the time taking 10 months .
this time , he estimates , it will take about three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with no quick fix in sight , bp is looking for clever ideas from the public hair-brained schemes ?
publically flummoxed – and threatened by a drastic loss of face – bp has launched the website www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com to collect creative ideas from the general public on how to solve the spill .
submissions are then forwarded to engineers .
bp spokesperson bryan ferguson told reporters in louisiana that he had " no idea " to what extent these suggestions were being worked on , but said that bp had " flown in experts from around the world to collaborate and contemplate the ideas that are presented . "
most of the ideas being presented are probably not feasible , unfortunately .
professor schwark at the university of kiel said that he has received a number of emails himself in recent days from individuals wanting to present him their own ideas .
" most of them were quite drastic , including planting a nuclear device on the seafloor and just blowing up the whole area , " he said .
" i was wondering whether people do consider the effects of such an event if carried out under water in the real world , and not just in a comic film . "
a local initiative some initiatives led by non-experts are already underway along the threatened gulf shoreline .
in walton county , florida , sheriff michael a. adkinson unveiled his plan to protect 42 kilometers of white , sandy beaches .
adkinson has hired a private contractor to float several barges loaded with 1,400 pound -lrb- 635 kilogram -rrb- bales of hay into the gulf , which will then be shredded and blown onto the surface of the water , where he believes it will absorb the oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already doing damage to marine life , the spill threatens shorelines as well as for the source of the problem , schwark said , if his three-month estimation for relief efforts is correct and the oil flow remains constant , the amount spilled will total around 40 thousand tons , equal to the amount of oil leaked during the alaskan exxon-valdez disaster in 1989 – the biggest in us history to date .
schwark added that , given the 80-kilometer -lrb- 50-mile -rrb- distance from the shoreline in this case , he did n't think the overall environmental impact would be as devastating as in alaska .
said mary landry of the us coast guard , " i do n't think any of us know at this time what the impact will be on the environment , or the economic issues that are associated with this spill . "

bp is considering using a smaller containment dome that will be less prone to clogging .
admiral thad allen , head of the us coast guard , also told cbs television that a type of plug was also being considered .
" they 're actually going to take a bunch of debris – shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that – and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up and stop the leak . "
however , experts warn that if such a procedure failed , it could cause the flow of the oil to increase exponentially .
the only sure option , geologist lorenz schwark told deutsche welle , is to drill a relief well to intercept the original well and to fill it with very heavy cement that would block the oil 's flow .
this process was used once in the gulf of mexico in 1979 ; at the time taking 10 months .
this time , he estimates , it will take about three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with no quick fix in sight , bp is looking for clever ideas from the public hair-brained schemes ?
publically flummoxed – and threatened by a drastic loss of face – bp has launched the website www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com to collect creative ideas from the general public on how to solve the spill .
submissions are then forwarded to engineers .
bp spokesperson bryan ferguson told reporters in louisiana that he had " no idea " to what extent these suggestions were being worked on , but said that bp had " flown in experts from around the world to collaborate and contemplate the ideas that are presented . "
most of the ideas being presented are probably not feasible , unfortunately .
professor schwark at the university of kiel said that he has received a number of emails himself in recent days from individuals wanting to present him their own ideas .
" most of them were quite drastic , including planting a nuclear device on the seafloor and just blowing up the whole area , " he said .
" i was wondering whether people do consider the effects of such an event if carried out under water in the real world , and not just in a comic film . "
a local initiative some initiatives led by non-experts are already underway along the threatened gulf shoreline .
in walton county , florida , sheriff michael a. adkinson unveiled his plan to protect 42 kilometers of white , sandy beaches .
adkinson has hired a private contractor to float several barges loaded with 1,400 pound -lrb- 635 kilogram -rrb- bales of hay into the gulf , which will then be shredded and blown onto the surface of the water , where he believes it will absorb the oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already doing damage to marine life , the spill threatens shorelines as well as for the source of the problem , schwark said , if his three-month estimation for relief efforts is correct and the oil flow remains constant , the amount spilled will total around 40 thousand tons , equal to the amount of oil leaked during the alaskan exxon-valdez disaster in 1989 – the biggest in us history to date .
schwark added that , given the 80-kilometer -lrb- 50-mile -rrb- distance from the shoreline in this case , he did n't think the overall environmental impact would be as devastating as in alaska .
said mary landry of the us coast guard , " i do n't think any of us know at this time what the impact will be on the environment , or the economic issues that are associated with this spill . "

first there was the question whether germany even needed such a memorial and then what it should look like .
when american designer peter eisenman finally presented his design after considerable wrangling , the criticism came pouring in .
the memorial contained 2,711 concrete steles .
" too blockish , " complained the critics , " too abstract . "
they said it was just another drop zone for memorial wreaths , an adventure playground for teenaged antics .
a final stroke carved in stone for historical amnesiacs .
even an invitation for neo-nazi vandalism in the middle of berlin .
though the skepticism and concern were understandable , it has become clear over the five years of the monument 's existence that they were unnecessary . the field of pillars lies at the heart of berlin in quick walking distance to the brandenburg gate - arguably germany 's most famous national symbol .
open to visitors at all times , the memorial is not fenced off , there 's no entry fee , and it requires no more from its visitors than a willingness to engage with it .
the underground information center , which was added later , complements the abstract monument by giving the names of the victims and telling their tales of suffering .
some two million people have already visited the center ; many more have walked through the monument above .
even if it is just one more sight to see on their tour of berlin , the number of visitors the memorial receives daily testifies to the monument having become just as part of everyday life as it is part of germany 's larger culture of remembrance .
those who wish to learn more about the holocaust do n't have to look far .
the newly openend " topography of terror " - a sort of counterpart to the memorial - tells the story of the nazis ' crimes against humanity in explicit detail .
meanwhile , the memorial to europe 's murdered jews , remarkable for its abstraction and size , has become part of berlin 's historical landscape .
it is part of a germany-wide network of holocaust museums and memorials that so often commemorate victims ' individual fates .
one should not forget , as the memorial marks its fifth anniversary , that it was not something forced on the country from above or by the descendents of the victims .
nor did its conceptualization begin at an official level .
in fact , the idea was born twenty years ago in a citizens ' initiative spearheaded by journalist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
and so the monument is , in the best sense , a manifestation of personal dedication and historical conscience .
this memorial replaces neither live conversations with those who endured the holcaust , nor the private mourning of individuals .
and it certainly does n't absolve us from our responsibility of coming to terms with the holocaust , national-socialism and war in general in our schools , scholarship and society .
it is , however , an example of how intensively - after a long period of concealment and sugar-coating - germany is dealing with its nazi past .

it is very popular in europe but in china , on the other hand , it is not so wide-spread .
the birth control pill is stocked on the shelves in every pharmacy in china - right next to nasal spray and pain relievers .
a month 's supply costs just over two euros .
people in china do not need a doctor 's prescription to buy it ; women who are interested just ask a pharmacist .

i have heard it can cause vascular diseases in women over 40 and it is also not good for the heart . "
another woman agrees : " i used to take it , but only seldom .

it has shaped population curves all over the world , but not in china , where it ca n't seem to catch on . half a century ago , in the year 1960 , a birth control pill by the name of " evonid " went onto the market in the usa – today , 50 years later , the pill is one of the most important forms of contraception .
it is very popular in europe but in china , on the other hand , it is not so wide-spread .
the birth control pill is stocked on the shelves in every pharmacy in china - right next to nasal spray and pain relievers .
a month 's supply costs just over two euros .
people in china do not need a doctor 's prescription to buy it ; women who are interested just ask a pharmacist .
one woman in a pharmacy in beijing says , " i do n't know what different kinds of pills there are .
i buy the one that the pharmacist suggests - the one with the least amount of side-effects . "
sexual emancipation - in the west when the pill went on the market in the usa in 1960 , china was quick to follow .
a few years later the country came out with its own contraceptive pills .
in the west , the pill was celebrated as sexual emancipation for women , but in china it was seen as merely a new form of contraception that could help slow down the rapid growth of the population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many young chinese women use the pill for contraception one woman from beijing remembers how the government propagated the pill .
she says , " in the beginning , our work units handed out the pill to us .
you could just go there and get it for free . "
despite being promoted by the government , the pill was never really accepted as a universal form of contraceptive in china , neither in the cities , nor in the country .
according to official chinese statistics , merely two to three percent of chinese women take the pill .
and even those numbers are dwindling .
' throws the body off balance ' women in beijing say they do n't like the pill 's side-effects .
one woman says , " the good thing about the pill is that it makes your skin nice and reduces acne , but it is also unhealthy .
i have heard it can cause vascular diseases in women over 40 and it is also not good for the heart . "
another woman agrees : " i used to take it , but only seldom .
taking the pill is primitive ; there are too many side-effects and it can cause damage to the body .
it throws the body off balance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six women who did n't take the pill - these ladies flaunt their bumps for the 2008 olympics other methods of contraception are preferred in china , like the contraceptive coil , condoms and plain " being careful " .
but because the latter is far from fool-proof , abortions are also very common .
they are carried out in normal hospitals or in private and often illegal clinics , where prices are very low , as are hygienic standards .
in a regular hospital , an abortion costs around 100 euros and getting an appointment is never a problem .
the patients do not need a doctor 's approval , nor consultation .
more and more young women get abortions , some even get many ; there is no talk of the psychological impact abortions can have .
china is one-of-a-kind in this respect .
it is not likely that china will ever change its policy and promote the pill over abortions .
discussions about the moral implications of killing an unborn child do not officially take place .

" five years ago , ruettgers won the nrw state election not because he was so convincing , but because the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- -green coalition government was doing so poorly .
this time , he lost the election - not because he was doing such a bad job , but because of the government in berlin . " the mass circulation bild zeitung writes in its monday edition that sunday 's state elections marked a " political landslide " in which voters gave merkel 's government a " lesson it will not forget during this term " , which lasts until 2013 .
" boom bang bang - nrw voters taught the christian democrats and free democrats a lesson and changed the country 's political statics , " writes the berliner morgenpost . the slap in the face by germany 's most populous state was meant also for chancellor -lrb- angela -rrb- merkel and her deputy -lrb- guido -rrb- westerwelle , the paper says , adding that in the end , it was most likely the highly unpopular greek bailout package that influenced the voters . the cdu and the fdp have suffered a major defeat , comments the ostsee-zeitung - with grave consequences beyond the state of nrw .
" the end of the cdu-fdp coalition government in nrw marks a turning point for the coalition with the same partners on the federal level as well , " the paper continues .
" the majority in the upper house is gone , and so are major projects : tax reform and extending the life-span of germany 's nuclear power plants .
the wiggle room for angela merkel and her deputy , fdp leader guido westerwelle , has shrunk before they even dared use it . "
the rheinische post also regards the loss of the majority in the upper house , the bundesrat , as a problem for angela merkel and her coalition government .
" no matter who ends up forming the new government in nrw , the chancellor will have to scramble for a majority in the bundesrat in each individual case . " ruettgers is taking the rap for a situation that berlin is really responsible for , writes the donaukurier . " voters in nrw did n't vote against juergen ruettgers ; rather , they showed angela merkel and guido westerwelle the yellow card . losing the majority in the upper house is a just penalty for a never-ending discussion on tax reforms that has paralysed the lower house of parliament for the past six months .

the east asian nation has not only become one of sri lanka 's key trade partners and a major military ally , but it has helped the south asian country counter western pressure on issues such as human rights . it has been a year since sri lanka 's army secured victory over the tamil tiger rebels or ltte and the decades ' old civil war came to an end .
this would n't have become possible without the support of sri lanka 's key ally china , many in the south asian nation think .

the east asian nation has not only become one of sri lanka 's key trade partners and a major military ally , but it has helped the south asian country counter western pressure on issues such as human rights . it has been a year since sri lanka 's army secured victory over the tamil tiger rebels or ltte and the decades ' old civil war came to an end .
this would n't have become possible without the support of sri lanka 's key ally china , many in the south asian nation think .

after that the relations between the two traditional allies strengthened further . experts say the basis for the close bilateral ties between the two sides is the fact that china ’ s support to sri lanka is unconditional .

a debacle , a german political analyst says . " merkel has to start to think about how she can stay in power and make political decisions until the next federal elections in 2013 , " gero neugebauer , an analyst at the berlin-based otto-suhr-institute of political science , told deutsche welle .
until now , the western german state of north rhine-westphalia was ruled by the same coalition of center-right parties that angela merkel leads in berlin , the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the business-friendly , liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
sunday 's poll is being seen as a damaging referendum on her government in its first electoral test since she won re-election last september .
with both parties returning disappointing results , they no longer hold a majority of seats in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament .
merkel 's coalition is now in for tougher compromise negotiations with the social democratic and green opposition at the federal level when it comes to controversial plans for tax and budget cuts and health-care reform .
less room to maneuver " sixteen state governments and seven different types of coalitions - that has n't been easy in the past , and it will become more difficult in the future , " neugebauer said , adding that the chancellor could also benefit from the election results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's ruettgers could n't bring home the win merkel needed " merkel could use her party 's defeat and that of her coalition partner 's party to put more pressure on the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- to cooperate more closely than before . "
she could tell the liberals to " keep silent and reduce their demands . "
first , however , merkel may have to deal with critics from within her own party .
" the strategy of doing nothing has failed , " josef schlarmann , head of the cdu 's business wing and a member of the party executive told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
the cdu premiers , peter mueller of saarland and christian wulff of lower saxony warned that " business as usual " is not how the coalition government should proceed .
no more dithering a christian democratic politician and former deputy defense minister has called for serious consequences : " resignations are unavoidable to avoid a lingering decline , " willy wimmer told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
merkel must rethink her style of governing , political analyst neugebauer said .
" what she likes most is to sit in the middle and to try to mediate , to negotiate and to bring things together .
what she has to learn is that she ca n't always prevent every crisis - crisis management , that is what has to learn . "
the election debacle comes as eurozone members agreed late on sunday to an unprecedented 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 960 billion -rrb- safety net to ensure the stability of the euro currency .
merkel was scheduled to meet with all party leaders later on monday to discuss the deal , which requires legislative approval .

a debacle , a german political analyst says . " merkel has to start to think about how she can stay in power and make political decisions until the next federal elections in 2013 , " gero neugebauer , an analyst at the berlin-based otto-suhr-institute of political science , told deutsche welle .
until now , the western german state of north rhine-westphalia was ruled by the same coalition of center-right parties that angela merkel leads in berlin , the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the business-friendly , liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
sunday 's poll is being seen as a damaging referendum on her government in its first electoral test since she won re-election last september .
with both parties returning disappointing results , they no longer hold a majority of seats in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament .
merkel 's coalition is now in for tougher compromise negotiations with the social democratic and green opposition at the federal level when it comes to controversial plans for tax and budget cuts and health-care reform .
less room to maneuver " sixteen state governments and seven different types of coalitions - that has n't been easy in the past , and it will become more difficult in the future , " neugebauer said , adding that the chancellor could also benefit from the election results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's ruettgers could n't bring home the win merkel needed " merkel could use her party 's defeat and that of her coalition partner 's party to put more pressure on the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- to cooperate more closely than before . "
she could tell the liberals to " keep silent and reduce their demands . "
first , however , merkel may have to deal with critics from within her own party .
" the strategy of doing nothing has failed , " josef schlarmann , head of the cdu 's business wing and a member of the party executive told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
the cdu premiers , peter mueller of saarland and christian wulff of lower saxony warned that " business as usual " is not how the coalition government should proceed .
no more dithering a christian democratic politician and former deputy defense minister has called for serious consequences : " resignations are unavoidable to avoid a lingering decline , " willy wimmer told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
merkel must rethink her style of governing , political analyst neugebauer said .
" what she likes most is to sit in the middle and to try to mediate , to negotiate and to bring things together .
what she has to learn is that she ca n't always prevent every crisis - crisis management , that is what has to learn . "
the election debacle comes as eurozone members agreed late on sunday to an unprecedented 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 960 billion -rrb- safety net to ensure the stability of the euro currency .
merkel was scheduled to meet with all party leaders later on monday to discuss the deal , which requires legislative approval .

those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .
no-names were the stars bildunterschrift : klose had a lot of time for rest and reflection this season the mvp of the season was arjen robben , who brought a whole new level of class to the bundesliga , but otherwise this was not a good year for marquee players .
at bayern , van gaal decided he could largely live without luca toni , miroslav klose , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuck , whose services had cost bayern at least 66 million euros -lrb- $ 86 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .
they 'll be playing in the champions league next season .
cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .
comedies of errors bildunterschrift : burchert learned the hard way about the risks of coming out of goal 2009-10 will also be remembered as the year established clubs found new and innovative ways to lose .
no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .
in fact , sometimes german football resembled professional wrestling , with a variety of objects being enlisted to help individuals express their dissatisfaction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero 's aim , in this instance , was good in bochum , a security official was clobbered with a chair , as fans realized they , too , had been relegated .
and down in the second division , hansa rostock supporters hit their own goalkeeper with a tossed firecracker .
but one player fought back .
hamburg striker paolo guerrero beaned a supporter with a water bottle after some unappreciated criticism .
it was one of peruvian 's rare appearances - he missed 28 games due to injury , fear of flying and suspension .
" when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro , " wrote the late , great hunter s. thompson .
but 2009-10 was a year in which once the season got going , the pros turned weird .

those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .
no-names were the stars bildunterschrift : klose had a lot of time for rest and reflection this season the mvp of the season was arjen robben , who brought a whole new level of class to the bundesliga , but otherwise this was not a good year for marquee players .
at bayern , van gaal decided he could largely live without luca toni , miroslav klose , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuck , whose services had cost bayern at least 66 million euros -lrb- $ 86 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .
they 'll be playing in the champions league next season .
cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .
comedies of errors bildunterschrift : burchert learned the hard way about the risks of coming out of goal 2009-10 will also be remembered as the year established clubs found new and innovative ways to lose .
no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .
in fact , sometimes german football resembled professional wrestling , with a variety of objects being enlisted to help individuals express their dissatisfaction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero 's aim , in this instance , was good in bochum , a security official was clobbered with a chair , as fans realized they , too , had been relegated .
and down in the second division , hansa rostock supporters hit their own goalkeeper with a tossed firecracker .
but one player fought back .
hamburg striker paolo guerrero beaned a supporter with a water bottle after some unappreciated criticism .
it was one of peruvian 's rare appearances - he missed 28 games due to injury , fear of flying and suspension .
" when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro , " wrote the late , great hunter s. thompson .
but 2009-10 was a year in which once the season got going , the pros turned weird .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 10.05.2010 merkel 's coalition suffers big defeat in key state election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier ruettgers suffered a ' bitter ' defeat german chancellor angela merkel 's center-right coalition parties have suffered huge losses in elections in north rhine-westphalia , robbing her government of a majority in the upper house of parliament . results from sunday 's poll show merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- won 34.6 percent of the vote , down a full 10 percentage points from the last election in 2005 and their worst showing ever in the state .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were only marginally behind , winning 34.5 percent of the vote . the business-friendly free democrats , the cdu 's current coalition partner in north rhine-westphalia and at the national level , gained half a percentage point , winning 6.7 percent of the vote .
the environmentalist greens did the best , almost doubling their showing from the last state election , securing 12.1 percent .
the left party won 5.6 percent , and is now poised to enter the nrw state parliament for the first time .
the election outcome means that the opposition social democrats and the green party could narrowly form a governing coalition in germany 's most populous state with a slim one-vote majority , but would likely require support from the left party . the alternatives are a coalition between the cdu and the greens , a grand coalition of spd and cdu , a so-called ' jamaica ' alliance between the cdu , greens and fdp , or a ' traffic light ' coalition between the spd , greens and fdp .
a failed test the nrw state election was the first litmus test for chancellor merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp government . the loss in north rhine-westphalia has cost her government its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .

the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were only marginally behind , winning 34.5 percent of the vote . the business-friendly free democrats , the cdu 's current coalition partner in north rhine-westphalia and at the national level , gained half a percentage point , winning 6.7 percent of the vote .

it has shaped population curves all over the world , but not in china , where it ca n't seem to catch on . half a century ago , in the year 1960 , a birth control pill by the name of " evonid " went onto the market in the usa – today , 50 years later , the pill is one of the most important forms of contraception .
it is very popular in europe but in china , on the other hand , it is not so wide-spread .
the birth control pill is stocked on the shelves in every pharmacy in china - right next to nasal spray and pain relievers .
a month 's supply costs just over two euros .
people in china do not need a doctor 's prescription to buy it ; women who are interested just ask a pharmacist .
one woman in a pharmacy in beijing says , " i do n't know what different kinds of pills there are .
i buy the one that the pharmacist suggests - the one with the least amount of side-effects . "
sexual emancipation - in the west when the pill went on the market in the usa in 1960 , china was quick to follow .
a few years later the country came out with its own contraceptive pills .
in the west , the pill was celebrated as sexual emancipation for women , but in china it was seen as merely a new form of contraception that could help slow down the rapid growth of the population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many young chinese women use the pill for contraception one woman from beijing remembers how the government propagated the pill .
she says , " in the beginning , our work units handed out the pill to us .
you could just go there and get it for free . "
despite being promoted by the government , the pill was never really accepted as a universal form of contraceptive in china , neither in the cities , nor in the country .
according to official chinese statistics , merely two to three percent of chinese women take the pill .
and even those numbers are dwindling .
' throws the body off balance ' women in beijing say they do n't like the pill 's side-effects .
one woman says , " the good thing about the pill is that it makes your skin nice and reduces acne , but it is also unhealthy .
i have heard it can cause vascular diseases in women over 40 and it is also not good for the heart . "
another woman agrees : " i used to take it , but only seldom .
taking the pill is primitive ; there are too many side-effects and it can cause damage to the body .
it throws the body off balance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six women who did n't take the pill - these ladies flaunt their bumps for the 2008 olympics other methods of contraception are preferred in china , like the contraceptive coil , condoms and plain " being careful " .
but because the latter is far from fool-proof , abortions are also very common .
they are carried out in normal hospitals or in private and often illegal clinics , where prices are very low , as are hygienic standards .
in a regular hospital , an abortion costs around 100 euros and getting an appointment is never a problem .
the patients do not need a doctor 's approval , nor consultation .
more and more young women get abortions , some even get many ; there is no talk of the psychological impact abortions can have .
china is one-of-a-kind in this respect .
it is not likely that china will ever change its policy and promote the pill over abortions .
discussions about the moral implications of killing an unborn child do not officially take place .

the red shirts hold suthep responsible for a clash with soldiers which left 25 people dead on april 10 , as he was in charge of security matters at that time .
suthep has denied responsibility for the deadly clash that was triggered by an unsuccessful attempt to remove the protesters by force .
but a government spokesman said suthep has agreed to meet investigators on tuesday to hear the accusations against him .
bargaining for bail thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva proposed a peace " road map " last week , which includes the dissolution of parliament in the second half of september and fresh elections on november 14 , as well as proposals for political reforms .
he also issued an ultimatum to the protesters , demanding they reply to his offer by monday , may 10 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red shirts will not end their protests for the time being the red shirts , supporters of the exiled former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , in turn also put forward several other demands , including a reopening of their tv channel .
observers believe they are reluctant to vacate their encampments because they fear legal repercussions for their partly violent protests .
their demand for suthep to turn himself in has been seen as an attempt to strike a bargain with the government to be assured bail once they end the protests. tb / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the site , near the kosovo border , was " more proof that serbia does not shy away from its dark past and is ready to bring to justice all those who have committed crimes , " said prosecutor vladimir vukcevic .
during the two-year conflict , serb forces controlled by former strongman slobodan milosevic transported the remains of hundreds of ethnic albanian civilians to several locations in serbia in a bid to cover up mass killings and war crimes .
in 2001 , the remains of more than 830 kosovo albanians were found at three sites in serbia .
over 700 bodies have since been uncovered in a mass grave located in a suburb of the capital , belgrade .
dozens more were found in the towns of petrovo selo and perucac .
the exhumation of bodies from the raska site is expected to begin soon when an evaluation of the crime scene is completed .
a former top police official and serbian deputy interior minister during the kosovo conflict , vlastimir djordjevic , is believed to have ordered the vast cover-up .

a debacle , a german political analyst says . " merkel has to start to think about how she can stay in power and make political decisions until the next federal elections in 2013 , " gero neugebauer , an analyst at the berlin-based otto-suhr-institute of political science , told deutsche welle .
until now , the western german state of north rhine-westphalia was ruled by the same coalition of center-right parties that angela merkel leads in berlin , the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the business-friendly , liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
sunday 's poll is being seen as a damaging referendum on her government in its first electoral test since she won re-election last september .
with both parties returning disappointing results , they no longer hold a majority of seats in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament .
merkel 's coalition is now in for tougher compromise negotiations with the social democratic and green opposition at the federal level when it comes to controversial plans for tax and budget cuts and health-care reform .
less room to maneuver " sixteen state governments and seven different types of coalitions - that has n't been easy in the past , and it will become more difficult in the future , " neugebauer said , adding that the chancellor could also benefit from the election results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's ruettgers could n't bring home the win merkel needed " merkel could use her party 's defeat and that of her coalition partner 's party to put more pressure on the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- to cooperate more closely than before . "
she could tell the liberals to " keep silent and reduce their demands . "
first , however , merkel may have to deal with critics from within her own party .
" the strategy of doing nothing has failed , " josef schlarmann , head of the cdu 's business wing and a member of the party executive told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
the cdu premiers , peter mueller of saarland and christian wulff of lower saxony warned that " business as usual " is not how the coalition government should proceed .
no more dithering a christian democratic politician and former deputy defense minister has called for serious consequences : " resignations are unavoidable to avoid a lingering decline , " willy wimmer told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
merkel must rethink her style of governing , political analyst neugebauer said .
" what she likes most is to sit in the middle and to try to mediate , to negotiate and to bring things together .
what she has to learn is that she ca n't always prevent every crisis - crisis management , that is what has to learn . "
the election debacle comes as eurozone members agreed late on sunday to an unprecedented 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 960 billion -rrb- safety net to ensure the stability of the euro currency .
merkel was scheduled to meet with all party leaders later on monday to discuss the deal , which requires legislative approval .

a debacle , a german political analyst says . " merkel has to start to think about how she can stay in power and make political decisions until the next federal elections in 2013 , " gero neugebauer , an analyst at the berlin-based otto-suhr-institute of political science , told deutsche welle .
until now , the western german state of north rhine-westphalia was ruled by the same coalition of center-right parties that angela merkel leads in berlin , the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the business-friendly , liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
sunday 's poll is being seen as a damaging referendum on her government in its first electoral test since she won re-election last september .
with both parties returning disappointing results , they no longer hold a majority of seats in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament .
merkel 's coalition is now in for tougher compromise negotiations with the social democratic and green opposition at the federal level when it comes to controversial plans for tax and budget cuts and health-care reform .
less room to maneuver " sixteen state governments and seven different types of coalitions - that has n't been easy in the past , and it will become more difficult in the future , " neugebauer said , adding that the chancellor could also benefit from the election results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's ruettgers could n't bring home the win merkel needed " merkel could use her party 's defeat and that of her coalition partner 's party to put more pressure on the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- to cooperate more closely than before . "
she could tell the liberals to " keep silent and reduce their demands . "
first , however , merkel may have to deal with critics from within her own party .
" the strategy of doing nothing has failed , " josef schlarmann , head of the cdu 's business wing and a member of the party executive told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
the cdu premiers , peter mueller of saarland and christian wulff of lower saxony warned that " business as usual " is not how the coalition government should proceed .
no more dithering a christian democratic politician and former deputy defense minister has called for serious consequences : " resignations are unavoidable to avoid a lingering decline , " willy wimmer told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
merkel must rethink her style of governing , political analyst neugebauer said .
" what she likes most is to sit in the middle and to try to mediate , to negotiate and to bring things together .
what she has to learn is that she ca n't always prevent every crisis - crisis management , that is what has to learn . "
the election debacle comes as eurozone members agreed late on sunday to an unprecedented 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 960 billion -rrb- safety net to ensure the stability of the euro currency .
merkel was scheduled to meet with all party leaders later on monday to discuss the deal , which requires legislative approval .

those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .
no-names were the stars bildunterschrift : klose had a lot of time for rest and reflection this season the mvp of the season was arjen robben , who brought a whole new level of class to the bundesliga , but otherwise this was not a good year for marquee players .
at bayern , van gaal decided he could largely live without luca toni , miroslav klose , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuck , whose services had cost bayern at least 66 million euros -lrb- $ 86 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .
they 'll be playing in the champions league next season .
cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .
comedies of errors bildunterschrift : burchert learned the hard way about the risks of coming out of goal 2009-10 will also be remembered as the year established clubs found new and innovative ways to lose .
no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .
in fact , sometimes german football resembled professional wrestling , with a variety of objects being enlisted to help individuals express their dissatisfaction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero 's aim , in this instance , was good in bochum , a security official was clobbered with a chair , as fans realized they , too , had been relegated .
and down in the second division , hansa rostock supporters hit their own goalkeeper with a tossed firecracker .
but one player fought back .
hamburg striker paolo guerrero beaned a supporter with a water bottle after some unappreciated criticism .
it was one of peruvian 's rare appearances - he missed 28 games due to injury , fear of flying and suspension .
" when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro , " wrote the late , great hunter s. thompson .
but 2009-10 was a year in which once the season got going , the pros turned weird .

those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .
no-names were the stars bildunterschrift : klose had a lot of time for rest and reflection this season the mvp of the season was arjen robben , who brought a whole new level of class to the bundesliga , but otherwise this was not a good year for marquee players .
at bayern , van gaal decided he could largely live without luca toni , miroslav klose , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuck , whose services had cost bayern at least 66 million euros -lrb- $ 86 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .
they 'll be playing in the champions league next season .
cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .
comedies of errors bildunterschrift : burchert learned the hard way about the risks of coming out of goal 2009-10 will also be remembered as the year established clubs found new and innovative ways to lose .
no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .
in fact , sometimes german football resembled professional wrestling , with a variety of objects being enlisted to help individuals express their dissatisfaction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero 's aim , in this instance , was good in bochum , a security official was clobbered with a chair , as fans realized they , too , had been relegated .
and down in the second division , hansa rostock supporters hit their own goalkeeper with a tossed firecracker .
but one player fought back .
hamburg striker paolo guerrero beaned a supporter with a water bottle after some unappreciated criticism .
it was one of peruvian 's rare appearances - he missed 28 games due to injury , fear of flying and suspension .
" when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro , " wrote the late , great hunter s. thompson .
but 2009-10 was a year in which once the season got going , the pros turned weird .

it has shaped population curves all over the world , but not in china , where it ca n't seem to catch on . half a century ago , in the year 1960 , a birth control pill by the name of " evonid " went onto the market in the usa – today , 50 years later , the pill is one of the most important forms of contraception .
it is very popular in europe but in china , on the other hand , it is not so wide-spread .
the birth control pill is stocked on the shelves in every pharmacy in china - right next to nasal spray and pain relievers .
a month 's supply costs just over two euros .
people in china do not need a doctor 's prescription to buy it ; women who are interested just ask a pharmacist .
one woman in a pharmacy in beijing says , " i do n't know what different kinds of pills there are .
i buy the one that the pharmacist suggests - the one with the least amount of side-effects . "
sexual emancipation - in the west when the pill went on the market in the usa in 1960 , china was quick to follow .
a few years later the country came out with its own contraceptive pills .
in the west , the pill was celebrated as sexual emancipation for women , but in china it was seen as merely a new form of contraception that could help slow down the rapid growth of the population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many young chinese women use the pill for contraception one woman from beijing remembers how the government propagated the pill .
she says , " in the beginning , our work units handed out the pill to us .
you could just go there and get it for free . "
despite being promoted by the government , the pill was never really accepted as a universal form of contraceptive in china , neither in the cities , nor in the country .
according to official chinese statistics , merely two to three percent of chinese women take the pill .
and even those numbers are dwindling .
' throws the body off balance ' women in beijing say they do n't like the pill 's side-effects .
one woman says , " the good thing about the pill is that it makes your skin nice and reduces acne , but it is also unhealthy .
i have heard it can cause vascular diseases in women over 40 and it is also not good for the heart . "
another woman agrees : " i used to take it , but only seldom .
taking the pill is primitive ; there are too many side-effects and it can cause damage to the body .
it throws the body off balance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six women who did n't take the pill - these ladies flaunt their bumps for the 2008 olympics other methods of contraception are preferred in china , like the contraceptive coil , condoms and plain " being careful " .
but because the latter is far from fool-proof , abortions are also very common .
they are carried out in normal hospitals or in private and often illegal clinics , where prices are very low , as are hygienic standards .
in a regular hospital , an abortion costs around 100 euros and getting an appointment is never a problem .
the patients do not need a doctor 's approval , nor consultation .
more and more young women get abortions , some even get many ; there is no talk of the psychological impact abortions can have .
china is one-of-a-kind in this respect .
it is not likely that china will ever change its policy and promote the pill over abortions .
discussions about the moral implications of killing an unborn child do not officially take place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 10.05.2010 oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slick began hitting us shores late last week bp 's 100-ton containment dome failed to funnel oil leaks that have been polluting the gulf of mexico for over two weeks .
as the slick reaches us shores , bp wants you to come up with a solution . the 100-ton containment dome that bp hoped would stop an ongoing oil spill into the gulf of mexico , has failed after clogging with ice crystals .
the dome , which was lowered to the seafloor last thursday , was meant to funnel leaking crude into a rigger .
the oil has been shooting into the gulf at a rate of 5,000 barrels -lrb- 210,000 gallons -rrb- per day , since an april 20 explosion off the coast of louisiana that left 11 missing and presumably dead .
with no quick fix in sight now and the oil slick reaching shorelines , bp is calling on clever non-experts to come up with solutions .
one sure option bp is putting a brave face on their current dilemma , which is bringing them tens of millions of dollars in new lawsuits , and costing them six million dollars -lrb- 4.6 million euros -rrb- in cleanup each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp 's 100-ton containment dome filled with ice crystals instead of funneling oil " i would n't say it 's failed yet , " said doug suttles , bp 's chief operating officer , the day after ice crystals clogged the containment dome .
" what i would say is , what we attempted to do last night did n't work . "
bp is considering using a smaller containment dome that will be less prone to clogging .
admiral thad allen , head of the us coast guard , also told cbs television that a type of plug was also being considered .
" they 're actually going to take a bunch of debris – shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that – and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up and stop the leak . "
however , experts warn that if such a procedure failed , it could cause the flow of the oil to increase exponentially .
the only sure option , geologist lorenz schwark told deutsche welle , is to drill a relief well to intercept the original well and to fill it with very heavy cement that would block the oil 's flow .
this process was used once in the gulf of mexico in 1979 ; at the time taking 10 months .
this time , he estimates , it will take about three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with no quick fix in sight , bp is looking for clever ideas from the public hair-brained schemes ?
publically flummoxed – and threatened by a drastic loss of face – bp has launched the website www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com to collect creative ideas from the general public on how to solve the spill .
submissions are then forwarded to engineers .
bp spokesperson bryan ferguson told reporters in louisiana that he had " no idea " to what extent these suggestions were being worked on , but said that bp had " flown in experts from around the world to collaborate and contemplate the ideas that are presented . "
most of the ideas being presented are probably not feasible , unfortunately .
professor schwark at the university of kiel said that he has received a number of emails himself in recent days from individuals wanting to present him their own ideas .
" most of them were quite drastic , including planting a nuclear device on the seafloor and just blowing up the whole area , " he said .
" i was wondering whether people do consider the effects of such an event if carried out under water in the real world , and not just in a comic film . "
a local initiative some initiatives led by non-experts are already underway along the threatened gulf shoreline .
in walton county , florida , sheriff michael a. adkinson unveiled his plan to protect 42 kilometers of white , sandy beaches .
adkinson has hired a private contractor to float several barges loaded with 1,400 pound -lrb- 635 kilogram -rrb- bales of hay into the gulf , which will then be shredded and blown onto the surface of the water , where he believes it will absorb the oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already doing damage to marine life , the spill threatens shorelines as well as for the source of the problem , schwark said , if his three-month estimation for relief efforts is correct and the oil flow remains constant , the amount spilled will total around 40 thousand tons , equal to the amount of oil leaked during the alaskan exxon-valdez disaster in 1989 – the biggest in us history to date .
schwark added that , given the 80-kilometer -lrb- 50-mile -rrb- distance from the shoreline in this case , he did n't think the overall environmental impact would be as devastating as in alaska .
said mary landry of the us coast guard , " i do n't think any of us know at this time what the impact will be on the environment , or the economic issues that are associated with this spill . "

british elections last thursday resulted in a hung parliament , with neither of the major parties - center-left labour and the center-right conservatives - winning a majority in parliament .
nick clegg 's liberal democrat party came in third , allowing it to take on a kingmaker role for whichever of the major parties it chooses to form a coalition with .
the centrist lib dems spent the past three days holding coalition talks with the conservatives , led by david cameron .
brown 's announcement that he would " play no part " in the selection of the next labour leader came as a surprise .
brown said it was " in the interests of the whole country to form a progressive coalition government . "
" the reason we have a hung parliament is that no single party and no single leader was able to win the full support of the country , " brown said .
" as leader of my party , i must accept that that is a judgment on me . "
brown said he hoped that a new leader would be chosen before the party conference in september. svs / dpa / afp editor : send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the red shirts hold suthep responsible for a clash with soldiers which left 25 people dead on april 10 , as he was in charge of security matters at that time .
suthep has denied responsibility for the deadly clash that was triggered by an unsuccessful attempt to remove the protesters by force .
but a government spokesman said suthep has agreed to meet investigators on tuesday to hear the accusations against him .
bargaining for bail thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva proposed a peace " road map " last week , which includes the dissolution of parliament in the second half of september and fresh elections on november 14 , as well as proposals for political reforms .
he also issued an ultimatum to the protesters , demanding they reply to his offer by monday , may 10 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red shirts will not end their protests for the time being the red shirts , supporters of the exiled former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , in turn also put forward several other demands , including a reopening of their tv channel .
observers believe they are reluctant to vacate their encampments because they fear legal repercussions for their partly violent protests .
their demand for suthep to turn himself in has been seen as an attempt to strike a bargain with the government to be assured bail once they end the protests. tb / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : disha uppal send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 10.05.2010 a bitter pill for the pill after 50 years in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many women all over the world take the pill the 50th birthday of the birth control pill was celebrated on may 9 .
it has shaped population curves all over the world , but not in china , where it ca n't seem to catch on . half a century ago , in the year 1960 , a birth control pill by the name of " evonid " went onto the market in the usa – today , 50 years later , the pill is one of the most important forms of contraception .
it is very popular in europe but in china , on the other hand , it is not so wide-spread .
the birth control pill is stocked on the shelves in every pharmacy in china - right next to nasal spray and pain relievers .
a month 's supply costs just over two euros .
people in china do not need a doctor 's prescription to buy it ; women who are interested just ask a pharmacist .
one woman in a pharmacy in beijing says , " i do n't know what different kinds of pills there are .
i buy the one that the pharmacist suggests - the one with the least amount of side-effects . "
sexual emancipation - in the west when the pill went on the market in the usa in 1960 , china was quick to follow .
a few years later the country came out with its own contraceptive pills .
in the west , the pill was celebrated as sexual emancipation for women , but in china it was seen as merely a new form of contraception that could help slow down the rapid growth of the population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many young chinese women use the pill for contraception one woman from beijing remembers how the government propagated the pill .
she says , " in the beginning , our work units handed out the pill to us .
you could just go there and get it for free . "
despite being promoted by the government , the pill was never really accepted as a universal form of contraceptive in china , neither in the cities , nor in the country .
according to official chinese statistics , merely two to three percent of chinese women take the pill .
and even those numbers are dwindling .
' throws the body off balance ' women in beijing say they do n't like the pill 's side-effects .
one woman says , " the good thing about the pill is that it makes your skin nice and reduces acne , but it is also unhealthy .
i have heard it can cause vascular diseases in women over 40 and it is also not good for the heart . "
another woman agrees : " i used to take it , but only seldom .
taking the pill is primitive ; there are too many side-effects and it can cause damage to the body .
it throws the body off balance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six women who did n't take the pill - these ladies flaunt their bumps for the 2008 olympics other methods of contraception are preferred in china , like the contraceptive coil , condoms and plain " being careful " .
but because the latter is far from fool-proof , abortions are also very common .
they are carried out in normal hospitals or in private and often illegal clinics , where prices are very low , as are hygienic standards .
in a regular hospital , an abortion costs around 100 euros and getting an appointment is never a problem .
the patients do not need a doctor 's approval , nor consultation .
more and more young women get abortions , some even get many ; there is no talk of the psychological impact abortions can have .
china is one-of-a-kind in this respect .
it is not likely that china will ever change its policy and promote the pill over abortions .
discussions about the moral implications of killing an unborn child do not officially take place .

" five years ago , ruettgers won the nrw state election not because he was so convincing , but because the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- -green coalition government was doing so poorly .
this time , he lost the election - not because he was doing such a bad job , but because of the government in berlin . " the mass circulation bild zeitung writes in its monday edition that sunday 's state elections marked a " political landslide " in which voters gave merkel 's government a " lesson it will not forget during this term " , which lasts until 2013 .
" boom bang bang - nrw voters taught the christian democrats and free democrats a lesson and changed the country 's political statics , " writes the berliner morgenpost . the slap in the face by germany 's most populous state was meant also for chancellor -lrb- angela -rrb- merkel and her deputy -lrb- guido -rrb- westerwelle , the paper says , adding that in the end , it was most likely the highly unpopular greek bailout package that influenced the voters . the cdu and the fdp have suffered a major defeat , comments the ostsee-zeitung - with grave consequences beyond the state of nrw .
" the end of the cdu-fdp coalition government in nrw marks a turning point for the coalition with the same partners on the federal level as well , " the paper continues .
" the majority in the upper house is gone , and so are major projects : tax reform and extending the life-span of germany 's nuclear power plants .
the wiggle room for angela merkel and her deputy , fdp leader guido westerwelle , has shrunk before they even dared use it . "
the rheinische post also regards the loss of the majority in the upper house , the bundesrat , as a problem for angela merkel and her coalition government .
" no matter who ends up forming the new government in nrw , the chancellor will have to scramble for a majority in the bundesrat in each individual case . " ruettgers is taking the rap for a situation that berlin is really responsible for , writes the donaukurier . " voters in nrw did n't vote against juergen ruettgers ; rather , they showed angela merkel and guido westerwelle the yellow card . losing the majority in the upper house is a just penalty for a never-ending discussion on tax reforms that has paralysed the lower house of parliament for the past six months .

the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were only marginally behind , winning 34.5 percent of the vote . the business-friendly free democrats , the cdu 's current coalition partner in north rhine-westphalia and at the national level , gained half a percentage point , winning 6.7 percent of the vote .
the environmentalist greens did the best , almost doubling their showing from the last state election , securing 12.1 percent .
the left party won 5.6 percent , and is now poised to enter the nrw state parliament for the first time .
the election outcome means that the opposition social democrats and the green party could narrowly form a governing coalition in germany 's most populous state with a slim one-vote majority , but would likely require support from the left party . the alternatives are a coalition between the cdu and the greens , a grand coalition of spd and cdu , a so-called ' jamaica ' alliance between the cdu , greens and fdp , or a ' traffic light ' coalition between the spd , greens and fdp .
a failed test the nrw state election was the first litmus test for chancellor merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp government . the loss in north rhine-westphalia has cost her government its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
the debacle in nrw will make it considerably harder for merkel to push through parliament key reforms and tax cuts needed to revitalize europe 's largest economy .
the election comes just days after the german bundestag approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
" this is a bitter defeat for the cdu in the state and federally , " gerd langguth , political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency . " it is also an object lesson for the performance of the federal government , especially for the fdp , " he added . " the greek aid package also had an effect .
people are n't happy about germany being europe 's paymaster , " he said . results that ca n't be ignored spd and green leaders took the election results as a sign of bigger changes to come in the country 's political landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft celebrates with other spd members " the spd is back ! "
social democrat candidate hannelore kraft told supporters as the first results came in . " an spd-green alliance is what north rhine-westphalia wants ! "
the co-chair of the greens , claudia roth , said the vote was the payback for the government 's decisions in berlin .
" for the federal cdu-fdp coalition , my friends , this is the beginning of the end , " she said .
a leading member of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach , also said the loss for the conservatives was a sign of bigger issues .
" i can only warn the cdu against trying to put a positive spin on this result , " he said .
" it is a huge disappointment . "
according to german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who also leads the fdp , the coalition government wo n't ignore these results , describing them as a " warning shot " by voters .

those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .
no-names were the stars bildunterschrift : klose had a lot of time for rest and reflection this season the mvp of the season was arjen robben , who brought a whole new level of class to the bundesliga , but otherwise this was not a good year for marquee players .
at bayern , van gaal decided he could largely live without luca toni , miroslav klose , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuck , whose services had cost bayern at least 66 million euros -lrb- $ 86 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .
they 'll be playing in the champions league next season .
cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .
comedies of errors bildunterschrift : burchert learned the hard way about the risks of coming out of goal 2009-10 will also be remembered as the year established clubs found new and innovative ways to lose .
no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .
in fact , sometimes german football resembled professional wrestling , with a variety of objects being enlisted to help individuals express their dissatisfaction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero 's aim , in this instance , was good in bochum , a security official was clobbered with a chair , as fans realized they , too , had been relegated .
and down in the second division , hansa rostock supporters hit their own goalkeeper with a tossed firecracker .
but one player fought back .

those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .
no-names were the stars bildunterschrift : klose had a lot of time for rest and reflection this season the mvp of the season was arjen robben , who brought a whole new level of class to the bundesliga , but otherwise this was not a good year for marquee players .
at bayern , van gaal decided he could largely live without luca toni , miroslav klose , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuck , whose services had cost bayern at least 66 million euros -lrb- $ 86 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .
they 'll be playing in the champions league next season .
cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .
comedies of errors bildunterschrift : burchert learned the hard way about the risks of coming out of goal 2009-10 will also be remembered as the year established clubs found new and innovative ways to lose .
no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .
in fact , sometimes german football resembled professional wrestling , with a variety of objects being enlisted to help individuals express their dissatisfaction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero 's aim , in this instance , was good in bochum , a security official was clobbered with a chair , as fans realized they , too , had been relegated .
and down in the second division , hansa rostock supporters hit their own goalkeeper with a tossed firecracker .
but one player fought back .
hamburg striker paolo guerrero beaned a supporter with a water bottle after some unappreciated criticism .
it was one of peruvian 's rare appearances - he missed 28 games due to injury , fear of flying and suspension .
" when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro , " wrote the late , great hunter s. thompson .
but 2009-10 was a year in which once the season got going , the pros turned weird .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 10.05.2010 five years on , berlin holocaust memorial is a landmark of remembrance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin holocaust memorial was a long time in the making now five years old , berlin 's holocaust memorial serves as a landmark of remembrance and a symbol of collective conscience - even as the structure threatens to crumble .
dw looks at the memorial 's past , present and future . in 1953 - in the wake of the holocaust - a first order of business for the young israeli state was the construction of the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem .
forty years later , washington , d.c. built its holocaust memorial .
yet it was n't until 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii , that germany , the atrocity 's perpetrator , unveiled its memorial to the murdered jews of europe . it 's been five years since the holocaust memorial opened at the center of berlin .
support and appreciation for the monument - which caused 13 years of heated debate and may now be disintegrating - is stronger than ever . a grassroots proposal the idea for the memorial first came at the beginning of 1989 through a citizens ' initiative in berlin , spearheaded by journalist and publicist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
the group wanted to see a national memorial to the jews who perished in the holocaust built in berlin , which was the capital of east germany at the time . with the fall of the berlin wall a few months later and the excitement of germany 's reunification shortly thereafter , the idea was almost immediately placed on the backburner .
a few years later , in 1992 , chancellor helmut kohl 's government became proponents of the memorial 's construction and set aside space for it next to berlin 's brandenburg gate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect peter eisenman says he could n't have done it without rosh 's support in bonn , still the capital of west germany , many parliamentarians fought for the monument to be built .
among them was christian democrat norbert lammert , who is now head of the memorial 's curatorial committee . lammert says that he and several others " emphatically advocated that the government 's move to berlin after reunification needed to begin with such a demonstrative sign . " but the monument itself would not be realized for quite some time .
after rounds of hearings , debates , competitions and exhibitions , the german parliament finally decided to create a foundation to decide on and implement a design for the memorial . throughout this process and the further debates that ensued , the memorial 's conceptualists , rosh and jaeckel , remained clear on what they wanted their brainchild to accomplish .
" we wanted the memorial to do three things , " rosh told deutsche welle : " to commemorate what took place , to honor the victims and to give them back their names . " the fruits of a long labor today , the monument does just that .
spreading over 19,000 square meters -lrb- over 200,000 square feet -rrb- in the middle of berlin , the memorial to the murdered jews of europe is made up of 2,711 gray , concrete steles of varying heights - a seemingly endless landscape of concrete waves that ca n't be overlooked . some critics found the monument too abstract and anonymous , so an information center was later added beneath the terrain , where visitors can learn about the holocaust and its victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial , located at the heart of berlin , is facing serious renovation the monument 's designer , american architect peter eisenman , has not been back to the memorial since its opening in may 2005 , and was originally against the addition of the information center .
now , he is more pleased than ever with his work . " it 's unusual for an american to sit here and say , it was my intention to give you back your memory , " eisenman said .
" it sounds rather condescending , but i think if i had been german , i would have done it and perceived it in the same way . " it was n't an easy road for eisenman ; the memorial that was finally constructed was the second proposal , after the large-scale sculptor richard serra backed out of the project . " i 'm very proud of what we accomplished .
we encountered a great deal of disputes and setbacks .
but lea rosh kept us from giving up , and step by step we got there .
by now , those difficulties have faded into history .
now it 's about the present and the future . looking forward the monument 's future is not fully unproblematic .
recently , faulty construction has begun taking a toll on the concrete pillars , and renovation or partial reconstruction will soon become urgently necessary . uwe neumaerker , the director of the memorial foundation , told deutsche welle he does not know how long the process will take , adding that " tests have shown that unfortunately it will take a very long time . "
still , neumaerker assures that " nothing will fall apart . " more likely than the memorial 's concrete steles falling on visitors , it seems , is visitors falling off steles .
the monument has become a popular destination for games of hide-and-seek , parkour daredevils and sun-worshippers that come on warm days to enjoy the shade-free tops of the steles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial is sometimes used for other purposes rosh takes a relatively relaxed stance toward visitors repurposing her memorial . " sometimes i go and see people sunning themselves on the steles and tell them that there are lawns for sunbathing in the tiergarten just across the street , " she said .
" i tell the boys who are hopping around on the steles that they should do that somewhere else . " when i tell the eight- to 12-year-olds that they should go into the information center below the memorial and then come talk to me about it , it 's always very powerful .
they tell me they 've learned a lot . " author : marcel fuerstenau -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" five years ago , ruettgers won the nrw state election not because he was so convincing , but because the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- -green coalition government was doing so poorly .
this time , he lost the election - not because he was doing such a bad job , but because of the government in berlin . " the mass circulation bild zeitung writes in its monday edition that sunday 's state elections marked a " political landslide " in which voters gave merkel 's government a " lesson it will not forget during this term " , which lasts until 2013 .
" boom bang bang - nrw voters taught the christian democrats and free democrats a lesson and changed the country 's political statics , " writes the berliner morgenpost . the slap in the face by germany 's most populous state was meant also for chancellor -lrb- angela -rrb- merkel and her deputy -lrb- guido -rrb- westerwelle , the paper says , adding that in the end , it was most likely the highly unpopular greek bailout package that influenced the voters . the cdu and the fdp have suffered a major defeat , comments the ostsee-zeitung - with grave consequences beyond the state of nrw .
" the end of the cdu-fdp coalition government in nrw marks a turning point for the coalition with the same partners on the federal level as well , " the paper continues .
" the majority in the upper house is gone , and so are major projects : tax reform and extending the life-span of germany 's nuclear power plants .
the wiggle room for angela merkel and her deputy , fdp leader guido westerwelle , has shrunk before they even dared use it . "
the rheinische post also regards the loss of the majority in the upper house , the bundesrat , as a problem for angela merkel and her coalition government .
" no matter who ends up forming the new government in nrw , the chancellor will have to scramble for a majority in the bundesrat in each individual case . " ruettgers is taking the rap for a situation that berlin is really responsible for , writes the donaukurier . " voters in nrw did n't vote against juergen ruettgers ; rather , they showed angela merkel and guido westerwelle the yellow card . losing the majority in the upper house is a just penalty for a never-ending discussion on tax reforms that has paralysed the lower house of parliament for the past six months .

british elections last thursday resulted in a hung parliament , with neither of the major parties - center-left labour and the center-right conservatives - winning a majority in parliament .
nick clegg 's liberal democrat party came in third , allowing it to take on a kingmaker role for whichever of the major parties it chooses to form a coalition with .
the centrist lib dems spent the past three days holding coalition talks with the conservatives , led by david cameron .
brown 's announcement that he would " play no part " in the selection of the next labour leader came as a surprise .
brown said it was " in the interests of the whole country to form a progressive coalition government . "
" the reason we have a hung parliament is that no single party and no single leader was able to win the full support of the country , " brown said .
" as leader of my party , i must accept that that is a judgment on me . "
brown said he hoped that a new leader would be chosen before the party conference in september. svs / dpa / afp editor : send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

british elections last thursday resulted in a hung parliament , with neither of the major parties - center-left labour and the center-right conservatives - winning a majority in parliament .
nick clegg 's liberal democrat party came in third , allowing it to take on a kingmaker role for whichever of the major parties it chooses to form a coalition with .
the centrist lib dems spent the past three days holding coalition talks with the conservatives , led by david cameron .
brown 's announcement that he would " play no part " in the selection of the next labour leader came as a surprise .
brown said it was " in the interests of the whole country to form a progressive coalition government . "
" the reason we have a hung parliament is that no single party and no single leader was able to win the full support of the country , " brown said .
" as leader of my party , i must accept that that is a judgment on me . "
brown said he hoped that a new leader would be chosen before the party conference in september. svs / dpa / afp editor : send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 10.05.2010 oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slick began hitting us shores late last week bp 's 100-ton containment dome failed to funnel oil leaks that have been polluting the gulf of mexico for over two weeks .
as the slick reaches us shores , bp wants you to come up with a solution . the 100-ton containment dome that bp hoped would stop an ongoing oil spill into the gulf of mexico , has failed after clogging with ice crystals .
the dome , which was lowered to the seafloor last thursday , was meant to funnel leaking crude into a rigger .
the oil has been shooting into the gulf at a rate of 5,000 barrels -lrb- 210,000 gallons -rrb- per day , since an april 20 explosion off the coast of louisiana that left 11 missing and presumably dead .
with no quick fix in sight now and the oil slick reaching shorelines , bp is calling on clever non-experts to come up with solutions .
one sure option bp is putting a brave face on their current dilemma , which is bringing them tens of millions of dollars in new lawsuits , and costing them six million dollars -lrb- 4.6 million euros -rrb- in cleanup each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp 's 100-ton containment dome filled with ice crystals instead of funneling oil " i would n't say it 's failed yet , " said doug suttles , bp 's chief operating officer , the day after ice crystals clogged the containment dome .
" what i would say is , what we attempted to do last night did n't work . "
bp is considering using a smaller containment dome that will be less prone to clogging .
admiral thad allen , head of the us coast guard , also told cbs television that a type of plug was also being considered .
" they 're actually going to take a bunch of debris – shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that – and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up and stop the leak . "
however , experts warn that if such a procedure failed , it could cause the flow of the oil to increase exponentially .
the only sure option , geologist lorenz schwark told deutsche welle , is to drill a relief well to intercept the original well and to fill it with very heavy cement that would block the oil 's flow .
this process was used once in the gulf of mexico in 1979 ; at the time taking 10 months .
this time , he estimates , it will take about three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with no quick fix in sight , bp is looking for clever ideas from the public hair-brained schemes ?
publically flummoxed – and threatened by a drastic loss of face – bp has launched the website www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com to collect creative ideas from the general public on how to solve the spill .
submissions are then forwarded to engineers .
bp spokesperson bryan ferguson told reporters in louisiana that he had " no idea " to what extent these suggestions were being worked on , but said that bp had " flown in experts from around the world to collaborate and contemplate the ideas that are presented . "
most of the ideas being presented are probably not feasible , unfortunately .
professor schwark at the university of kiel said that he has received a number of emails himself in recent days from individuals wanting to present him their own ideas .
" most of them were quite drastic , including planting a nuclear device on the seafloor and just blowing up the whole area , " he said .
" i was wondering whether people do consider the effects of such an event if carried out under water in the real world , and not just in a comic film . "
a local initiative some initiatives led by non-experts are already underway along the threatened gulf shoreline .
in walton county , florida , sheriff michael a. adkinson unveiled his plan to protect 42 kilometers of white , sandy beaches .
adkinson has hired a private contractor to float several barges loaded with 1,400 pound -lrb- 635 kilogram -rrb- bales of hay into the gulf , which will then be shredded and blown onto the surface of the water , where he believes it will absorb the oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already doing damage to marine life , the spill threatens shorelines as well as for the source of the problem , schwark said , if his three-month estimation for relief efforts is correct and the oil flow remains constant , the amount spilled will total around 40 thousand tons , equal to the amount of oil leaked during the alaskan exxon-valdez disaster in 1989 – the biggest in us history to date .
schwark added that , given the 80-kilometer -lrb- 50-mile -rrb- distance from the shoreline in this case , he did n't think the overall environmental impact would be as devastating as in alaska .
said mary landry of the us coast guard , " i do n't think any of us know at this time what the impact will be on the environment , or the economic issues that are associated with this spill . "

the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were only marginally behind , winning 34.5 percent of the vote . the business-friendly free democrats , the cdu 's current coalition partner in north rhine-westphalia and at the national level , gained half a percentage point , winning 6.7 percent of the vote .
the environmentalist greens did the best , almost doubling their showing from the last state election , securing 12.1 percent .
the left party won 5.6 percent , and is now poised to enter the nrw state parliament for the first time .
the election outcome means that the opposition social democrats and the green party could narrowly form a governing coalition in germany 's most populous state with a slim one-vote majority , but would likely require support from the left party . the alternatives are a coalition between the cdu and the greens , a grand coalition of spd and cdu , a so-called ' jamaica ' alliance between the cdu , greens and fdp , or a ' traffic light ' coalition between the spd , greens and fdp .
a failed test the nrw state election was the first litmus test for chancellor merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp government . the loss in north rhine-westphalia has cost her government its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
the debacle in nrw will make it considerably harder for merkel to push through parliament key reforms and tax cuts needed to revitalize europe 's largest economy .
the election comes just days after the german bundestag approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
" this is a bitter defeat for the cdu in the state and federally , " gerd langguth , political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency . " it is also an object lesson for the performance of the federal government , especially for the fdp , " he added . " the greek aid package also had an effect .
people are n't happy about germany being europe 's paymaster , " he said . results that ca n't be ignored spd and green leaders took the election results as a sign of bigger changes to come in the country 's political landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft celebrates with other spd members " the spd is back ! "
social democrat candidate hannelore kraft told supporters as the first results came in . " an spd-green alliance is what north rhine-westphalia wants ! "
the co-chair of the greens , claudia roth , said the vote was the payback for the government 's decisions in berlin .
" for the federal cdu-fdp coalition , my friends , this is the beginning of the end , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 10.05.2010 oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slick began hitting us shores late last week bp 's 100-ton containment dome failed to funnel oil leaks that have been polluting the gulf of mexico for over two weeks .
as the slick reaches us shores , bp wants you to come up with a solution . the 100-ton containment dome that bp hoped would stop an ongoing oil spill into the gulf of mexico , has failed after clogging with ice crystals .
the dome , which was lowered to the seafloor last thursday , was meant to funnel leaking crude into a rigger .
the oil has been shooting into the gulf at a rate of 5,000 barrels -lrb- 210,000 gallons -rrb- per day , since an april 20 explosion off the coast of louisiana that left 11 missing and presumably dead .
with no quick fix in sight now and the oil slick reaching shorelines , bp is calling on clever non-experts to come up with solutions .
one sure option bp is putting a brave face on their current dilemma , which is bringing them tens of millions of dollars in new lawsuits , and costing them six million dollars -lrb- 4.6 million euros -rrb- in cleanup each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp 's 100-ton containment dome filled with ice crystals instead of funneling oil " i would n't say it 's failed yet , " said doug suttles , bp 's chief operating officer , the day after ice crystals clogged the containment dome .
" what i would say is , what we attempted to do last night did n't work . "
bp is considering using a smaller containment dome that will be less prone to clogging .
admiral thad allen , head of the us coast guard , also told cbs television that a type of plug was also being considered .
" they 're actually going to take a bunch of debris – shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that – and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up and stop the leak . "
however , experts warn that if such a procedure failed , it could cause the flow of the oil to increase exponentially .
the only sure option , geologist lorenz schwark told deutsche welle , is to drill a relief well to intercept the original well and to fill it with very heavy cement that would block the oil 's flow .
this process was used once in the gulf of mexico in 1979 ; at the time taking 10 months .
this time , he estimates , it will take about three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with no quick fix in sight , bp is looking for clever ideas from the public hair-brained schemes ?
publically flummoxed – and threatened by a drastic loss of face – bp has launched the website www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com to collect creative ideas from the general public on how to solve the spill .
submissions are then forwarded to engineers .
bp spokesperson bryan ferguson told reporters in louisiana that he had " no idea " to what extent these suggestions were being worked on , but said that bp had " flown in experts from around the world to collaborate and contemplate the ideas that are presented . "
most of the ideas being presented are probably not feasible , unfortunately .
professor schwark at the university of kiel said that he has received a number of emails himself in recent days from individuals wanting to present him their own ideas .
" most of them were quite drastic , including planting a nuclear device on the seafloor and just blowing up the whole area , " he said .
" i was wondering whether people do consider the effects of such an event if carried out under water in the real world , and not just in a comic film . "
a local initiative some initiatives led by non-experts are already underway along the threatened gulf shoreline .
in walton county , florida , sheriff michael a. adkinson unveiled his plan to protect 42 kilometers of white , sandy beaches .
adkinson has hired a private contractor to float several barges loaded with 1,400 pound -lrb- 635 kilogram -rrb- bales of hay into the gulf , which will then be shredded and blown onto the surface of the water , where he believes it will absorb the oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already doing damage to marine life , the spill threatens shorelines as well as for the source of the problem , schwark said , if his three-month estimation for relief efforts is correct and the oil flow remains constant , the amount spilled will total around 40 thousand tons , equal to the amount of oil leaked during the alaskan exxon-valdez disaster in 1989 – the biggest in us history to date .
schwark added that , given the 80-kilometer -lrb- 50-mile -rrb- distance from the shoreline in this case , he did n't think the overall environmental impact would be as devastating as in alaska .
said mary landry of the us coast guard , " i do n't think any of us know at this time what the impact will be on the environment , or the economic issues that are associated with this spill . "

the red shirts hold suthep responsible for a clash with soldiers which left 25 people dead on april 10 , as he was in charge of security matters at that time .
suthep has denied responsibility for the deadly clash that was triggered by an unsuccessful attempt to remove the protesters by force .
but a government spokesman said suthep has agreed to meet investigators on tuesday to hear the accusations against him .
bargaining for bail thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva proposed a peace " road map " last week , which includes the dissolution of parliament in the second half of september and fresh elections on november 14 , as well as proposals for political reforms .
he also issued an ultimatum to the protesters , demanding they reply to his offer by monday , may 10 .

" five years ago , ruettgers won the nrw state election not because he was so convincing , but because the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- -green coalition government was doing so poorly .
this time , he lost the election - not because he was doing such a bad job , but because of the government in berlin . " the mass circulation bild zeitung writes in its monday edition that sunday 's state elections marked a " political landslide " in which voters gave merkel 's government a " lesson it will not forget during this term " , which lasts until 2013 .
" boom bang bang - nrw voters taught the christian democrats and free democrats a lesson and changed the country 's political statics , " writes the berliner morgenpost . the slap in the face by germany 's most populous state was meant also for chancellor -lrb- angela -rrb- merkel and her deputy -lrb- guido -rrb- westerwelle , the paper says , adding that in the end , it was most likely the highly unpopular greek bailout package that influenced the voters . the cdu and the fdp have suffered a major defeat , comments the ostsee-zeitung - with grave consequences beyond the state of nrw .
" the end of the cdu-fdp coalition government in nrw marks a turning point for the coalition with the same partners on the federal level as well , " the paper continues .
" the majority in the upper house is gone , and so are major projects : tax reform and extending the life-span of germany 's nuclear power plants .
the wiggle room for angela merkel and her deputy , fdp leader guido westerwelle , has shrunk before they even dared use it . "
the rheinische post also regards the loss of the majority in the upper house , the bundesrat , as a problem for angela merkel and her coalition government .
" no matter who ends up forming the new government in nrw , the chancellor will have to scramble for a majority in the bundesrat in each individual case . " ruettgers is taking the rap for a situation that berlin is really responsible for , writes the donaukurier . " voters in nrw did n't vote against juergen ruettgers ; rather , they showed angela merkel and guido westerwelle the yellow card . losing the majority in the upper house is a just penalty for a never-ending discussion on tax reforms that has paralysed the lower house of parliament for the past six months .

the east asian nation has not only become one of sri lanka 's key trade partners and a major military ally , but it has helped the south asian country counter western pressure on issues such as human rights . it has been a year since sri lanka 's army secured victory over the tamil tiger rebels or ltte and the decades ' old civil war came to an end .
this would n't have become possible without the support of sri lanka 's key ally china , many in the south asian nation think .
" china helped the sri lankan state immensely with the war with the ltte when the sri lankan government needed assistance in terms of weapons and ammunition etc , " says si keethaponcalan , an expert from the university of colombo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sri lankan army received ammunition from china during the war diplomatic support the people 's republic 's support came on the diplomatic front as well .
when the west sharply criticized the sri lankan government 's handling of the conflict , particularly the final stages of the war , and the us stopped its military aid over human rights issues , beijing threw its weight behind colombo by blocking a resolution censuring sri lanka at the un security council .
after that the relations between the two traditional allies strengthened further . experts say the basis for the close bilateral ties between the two sides is the fact that china ’ s support to sri lanka is unconditional .
" unlike the western countries and organizations which impose conditions when they give us aid , whether it is the world bank or imf or bilateral aid , the chinese have been giving us aid without asking questions , " says kalyananda godage , a former sri lankan ambassador to the eu . countering india another major reason why sri lanka values this relationship is that china acts as a counterweight to its long-term ally india , says jehan perera , the executive director of the national peace council , a civil rights body in colombo : " india has had a major impact on sri lanka and has pressurized sri lanka in various ways in the past .
so sri lanka would like to have a counterweight of equal size and stature to india to balance it off , " says perera . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lankan gems are world renowned , especially its blue sapphires and cat 's eyes growing chinese investment with almost $ 1 billion in development aid , beijing surpassed tokyo as colombo 's largest foreign donor last year . the chinese are also building a massive port worth almost a billion us dollars in hambantota on sri lanka 's southeastern coast .
some western media have reported that china would like to use it as a naval base .
but the sri lankan government has insisted that the purpose of the port is purely commercial . " china has a huge navy . it is now an emerging superpower and its trade is huge with the west .
china needs energy supplies from the middle east .
and all of this passes via sri lanka because of our location in the indian ocean .
so that has become very important , " says former diplomat godage . exciting market the emerging superpower has also become an increasingly important trading partner for the sri lankans .
gems , jewelry , tea and natural rubber are areas where colombo sees potential for the bilateral trade to grow further . " it is a market that is going to mature , " says shezard careem , one of the leading gem traders in colombo .
" it is tremendously wealthy and a luxury market as well .
it provides a whole gamut of opportunities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of sri lankans follow buddhism human rights : an ' internal issue ' while china and its western partners have differences over issues such as human rights in china , many in sri lanka consider this as china 's internal matter . " we are not going to be concerned about china 's human rights record , they can look after that , " says godage .
" we are interested in a good mutually beneficial relationship which also looks after our security , economic and political interests .
so we are very happy with our relationship with china . " the urge to not to lose or upset this ' valuable ' partner is so huge that sri lanka , a predominantly buddhist country , even stopped two of its cricket players from meeting the dalai lama in india recently . author : disha uppal editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.05.2010 world markets rise on news of measures to stabilize the eurozone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro shot up in trading against the dollar monday international markets reacted positively to the creation of a eurozone-stabilization package .
the funds will be used to rescue any eurozone country that gets into serious financial difficulty . news of the proposed eurozone stability package saw markets rise worldwide on monday , which was just the sort of reaction that european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund had hoped for .
frankfurt 's dax closed the day up 5.3 percent , london 's ftse 100 index ended the day up 5.16 percent , while in paris , the cac-40 soared to close up by 9.66 percent .
in new york , the dow jones jumped by more than four percent in early trading .
the euro shot up by 1.5 cents against the us dollar after the announcement of the deal , then fell slightly to 1.28 dollars as the markets waited to see if member nations would follow through with austerity measures .
this followed a 14-month low against the dollar last week , amid uncertainty that the bloc would rescue greece , spain and portugal from possible default . the markets were reacting to an announcement made by european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund in brussels early on monday , that they had agreed on the creation of permanent measures worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 964 billion -rrb- to bail out eurozone states that run into financial difficulty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has already secured a 110 billion-euro loan package from the eurozone and the imf under the plan , the european commission is to provide 60 billion euros , while members of the 16-nation eurozone have pledged 440 billion euros to the fund .
the imf is to contribute an additional 250 billion euros , said spanish finance minister elena salgado .
german chancellor angela merkel said that the nearly trillion-dollar package would serve to " strengthen and protect " the euro .
she said that the eurozone must actively resolve its stability problem " at the roots " by pressing member states to balance their budgets .
" budget consolidation in all member states is extraordinarily important , " said merkel .
the chancellor also welcomed new austerity measures promised by the spanish government , saying they send an important message to the markets .
washington has praised europe 's stabilization plans . one white house official said president barack obama supports " assertive action " to address the greek debt crisis , and that european leaders have his support .
calming the markets the european commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , olli rehn , said the massive bailout " proves that we will defend the euro , whatever it takes . "
the european central bank will also implement exceptional measures in support of the package , the eu 's top economic official said on monday .
international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn hailed the package as a big step forward , and said the imf would be happy to contribute should eurozone countries require additional help from beyond the european central bank .
calming the fears of international markets appears to be the main goal of the package , but swedish finance minister anders borg described the situation more bluntly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets seem to approve of the eurozone measures " we now see herd behavior in the markets that is really pack behavior , wolf pack behavior , " borg told reporters .
" if we will not stop these packs , they will tear the weaker countries apart . "
meanwhile , britain 's chancellor of the exchequer , alistair darling , said the package was a " good deal " for europe , and that it was in the best interests of britain 's banks and export market .
however , darling did make it clear that this was a problem for the eurogroup .
" what we ca n't do is provide support for the euro , " said darling .
" that 's got to be for those countries that use the euro that are members of the eurogroup . "
awkward timing the euro stabilization deal comes just as state elections in germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , have taken away merkel 's majority in the upper house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disapproval of the greek bailout could have been one of the factors to the cdu 's majority loss the results of the election in north rhine-westphalia were seen by some as a reaction to merkel 's reluctant support of the eu 's greek bailout , which is unpopular with many voters in germany .
nevertheless , merkel stressed the measures were needed to protect the euro and german incomes .
" it is the first time in the history of the euro and the eu , and we are protecting our currency in an extraordinary situation , " said merkel .
" i can also put it this way to the population : we are protecting the money of the people in germany . "
the european commission is planning to meet on wednesday to determine how to strengthen eu budget rules and economic surveillance in the eurozone to avoid a future crisis. mk / gb / apf / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the funds will be used to rescue any eurozone country that gets into serious financial difficulty . news of the proposed eurozone stability package saw markets rise worldwide on monday , which was just the sort of reaction that european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund had hoped for .
frankfurt 's dax closed the day up 5.3 percent , london 's ftse 100 index ended the day up 5.16 percent , while in paris , the cac-40 soared to close up by 9.66 percent .
in new york , the dow jones jumped by more than four percent in early trading .
the euro shot up by 1.5 cents against the us dollar after the announcement of the deal , then fell slightly to 1.28 dollars as the markets waited to see if member nations would follow through with austerity measures .
this followed a 14-month low against the dollar last week , amid uncertainty that the bloc would rescue greece , spain and portugal from possible default . the markets were reacting to an announcement made by european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund in brussels early on monday , that they had agreed on the creation of permanent measures worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 964 billion -rrb- to bail out eurozone states that run into financial difficulty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has already secured a 110 billion-euro loan package from the eurozone and the imf under the plan , the european commission is to provide 60 billion euros , while members of the 16-nation eurozone have pledged 440 billion euros to the fund .
the imf is to contribute an additional 250 billion euros , said spanish finance minister elena salgado .
german chancellor angela merkel said that the nearly trillion-dollar package would serve to " strengthen and protect " the euro .
she said that the eurozone must actively resolve its stability problem " at the roots " by pressing member states to balance their budgets .
" budget consolidation in all member states is extraordinarily important , " said merkel .
the chancellor also welcomed new austerity measures promised by the spanish government , saying they send an important message to the markets .
washington has praised europe 's stabilization plans . one white house official said president barack obama supports " assertive action " to address the greek debt crisis , and that european leaders have his support .
calming the markets the european commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , olli rehn , said the massive bailout " proves that we will defend the euro , whatever it takes . "
the european central bank will also implement exceptional measures in support of the package , the eu 's top economic official said on monday .
international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn hailed the package as a big step forward , and said the imf would be happy to contribute should eurozone countries require additional help from beyond the european central bank .
calming the fears of international markets appears to be the main goal of the package , but swedish finance minister anders borg described the situation more bluntly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets seem to approve of the eurozone measures " we now see herd behavior in the markets that is really pack behavior , wolf pack behavior , " borg told reporters .
" if we will not stop these packs , they will tear the weaker countries apart . "
meanwhile , britain 's chancellor of the exchequer , alistair darling , said the package was a " good deal " for europe , and that it was in the best interests of britain 's banks and export market .
however , darling did make it clear that this was a problem for the eurogroup .
" what we ca n't do is provide support for the euro , " said darling .
" that 's got to be for those countries that use the euro that are members of the eurogroup . "
awkward timing the euro stabilization deal comes just as state elections in germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , have taken away merkel 's majority in the upper house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disapproval of the greek bailout could have been one of the factors to the cdu 's majority loss the results of the election in north rhine-westphalia were seen by some as a reaction to merkel 's reluctant support of the eu 's greek bailout , which is unpopular with many voters in germany .
nevertheless , merkel stressed the measures were needed to protect the euro and german incomes .
" it is the first time in the history of the euro and the eu , and we are protecting our currency in an extraordinary situation , " said merkel .
" i can also put it this way to the population : we are protecting the money of the people in germany . "

it has shaped population curves all over the world , but not in china , where it ca n't seem to catch on . half a century ago , in the year 1960 , a birth control pill by the name of " evonid " went onto the market in the usa – today , 50 years later , the pill is one of the most important forms of contraception .
it is very popular in europe but in china , on the other hand , it is not so wide-spread .
the birth control pill is stocked on the shelves in every pharmacy in china - right next to nasal spray and pain relievers .
a month 's supply costs just over two euros .
people in china do not need a doctor 's prescription to buy it ; women who are interested just ask a pharmacist .
one woman in a pharmacy in beijing says , " i do n't know what different kinds of pills there are .
i buy the one that the pharmacist suggests - the one with the least amount of side-effects . "
sexual emancipation - in the west when the pill went on the market in the usa in 1960 , china was quick to follow .
a few years later the country came out with its own contraceptive pills .
in the west , the pill was celebrated as sexual emancipation for women , but in china it was seen as merely a new form of contraception that could help slow down the rapid growth of the population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many young chinese women use the pill for contraception one woman from beijing remembers how the government propagated the pill .
she says , " in the beginning , our work units handed out the pill to us .
you could just go there and get it for free . "
despite being promoted by the government , the pill was never really accepted as a universal form of contraceptive in china , neither in the cities , nor in the country .
according to official chinese statistics , merely two to three percent of chinese women take the pill .
and even those numbers are dwindling .
' throws the body off balance ' women in beijing say they do n't like the pill 's side-effects .
one woman says , " the good thing about the pill is that it makes your skin nice and reduces acne , but it is also unhealthy .
i have heard it can cause vascular diseases in women over 40 and it is also not good for the heart . "
another woman agrees : " i used to take it , but only seldom .
taking the pill is primitive ; there are too many side-effects and it can cause damage to the body .
it throws the body off balance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six women who did n't take the pill - these ladies flaunt their bumps for the 2008 olympics other methods of contraception are preferred in china , like the contraceptive coil , condoms and plain " being careful " .
but because the latter is far from fool-proof , abortions are also very common .
they are carried out in normal hospitals or in private and often illegal clinics , where prices are very low , as are hygienic standards .
in a regular hospital , an abortion costs around 100 euros and getting an appointment is never a problem .
the patients do not need a doctor 's approval , nor consultation .

british elections last thursday resulted in a hung parliament , with neither of the major parties - center-left labour and the center-right conservatives - winning a majority in parliament .
nick clegg 's liberal democrat party came in third , allowing it to take on a kingmaker role for whichever of the major parties it chooses to form a coalition with .
the centrist lib dems spent the past three days holding coalition talks with the conservatives , led by david cameron .
brown 's announcement that he would " play no part " in the selection of the next labour leader came as a surprise .
brown said it was " in the interests of the whole country to form a progressive coalition government . "
" the reason we have a hung parliament is that no single party and no single leader was able to win the full support of the country , " brown said .
" as leader of my party , i must accept that that is a judgment on me . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.05.2010 world markets rise on news of measures to stabilize the eurozone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro shot up in trading against the dollar monday international markets reacted positively to the creation of a eurozone-stabilization package .
the funds will be used to rescue any eurozone country that gets into serious financial difficulty . news of the proposed eurozone stability package saw markets rise worldwide on monday , which was just the sort of reaction that european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund had hoped for .
frankfurt 's dax closed the day up 5.3 percent , london 's ftse 100 index ended the day up 5.16 percent , while in paris , the cac-40 soared to close up by 9.66 percent .
in new york , the dow jones jumped by more than four percent in early trading .
the euro shot up by 1.5 cents against the us dollar after the announcement of the deal , then fell slightly to 1.28 dollars as the markets waited to see if member nations would follow through with austerity measures .
this followed a 14-month low against the dollar last week , amid uncertainty that the bloc would rescue greece , spain and portugal from possible default . the markets were reacting to an announcement made by european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund in brussels early on monday , that they had agreed on the creation of permanent measures worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 964 billion -rrb- to bail out eurozone states that run into financial difficulty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has already secured a 110 billion-euro loan package from the eurozone and the imf under the plan , the european commission is to provide 60 billion euros , while members of the 16-nation eurozone have pledged 440 billion euros to the fund .
the imf is to contribute an additional 250 billion euros , said spanish finance minister elena salgado .
german chancellor angela merkel said that the nearly trillion-dollar package would serve to " strengthen and protect " the euro .
she said that the eurozone must actively resolve its stability problem " at the roots " by pressing member states to balance their budgets .
" budget consolidation in all member states is extraordinarily important , " said merkel .
the chancellor also welcomed new austerity measures promised by the spanish government , saying they send an important message to the markets .
washington has praised europe 's stabilization plans . one white house official said president barack obama supports " assertive action " to address the greek debt crisis , and that european leaders have his support .
calming the markets the european commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , olli rehn , said the massive bailout " proves that we will defend the euro , whatever it takes . "
the european central bank will also implement exceptional measures in support of the package , the eu 's top economic official said on monday .
international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn hailed the package as a big step forward , and said the imf would be happy to contribute should eurozone countries require additional help from beyond the european central bank .
calming the fears of international markets appears to be the main goal of the package , but swedish finance minister anders borg described the situation more bluntly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets seem to approve of the eurozone measures " we now see herd behavior in the markets that is really pack behavior , wolf pack behavior , " borg told reporters .
" if we will not stop these packs , they will tear the weaker countries apart . "
meanwhile , britain 's chancellor of the exchequer , alistair darling , said the package was a " good deal " for europe , and that it was in the best interests of britain 's banks and export market .
however , darling did make it clear that this was a problem for the eurogroup .
" what we ca n't do is provide support for the euro , " said darling .
" that 's got to be for those countries that use the euro that are members of the eurogroup . "
awkward timing the euro stabilization deal comes just as state elections in germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , have taken away merkel 's majority in the upper house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disapproval of the greek bailout could have been one of the factors to the cdu 's majority loss the results of the election in north rhine-westphalia were seen by some as a reaction to merkel 's reluctant support of the eu 's greek bailout , which is unpopular with many voters in germany .
nevertheless , merkel stressed the measures were needed to protect the euro and german incomes .
" it is the first time in the history of the euro and the eu , and we are protecting our currency in an extraordinary situation , " said merkel .
" i can also put it this way to the population : we are protecting the money of the people in germany . "
the european commission is planning to meet on wednesday to determine how to strengthen eu budget rules and economic surveillance in the eurozone to avoid a future crisis. mk / gb / apf / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the euro shot up by 1.5 cents against the us dollar after the announcement of the deal , then fell slightly to 1.28 dollars as the markets waited to see if member nations would follow through with austerity measures .
this followed a 14-month low against the dollar last week , amid uncertainty that the bloc would rescue greece , spain and portugal from possible default . the markets were reacting to an announcement made by european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund in brussels early on monday , that they had agreed on the creation of permanent measures worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 964 billion -rrb- to bail out eurozone states that run into financial difficulty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has already secured a 110 billion-euro loan package from the eurozone and the imf under the plan , the european commission is to provide 60 billion euros , while members of the 16-nation eurozone have pledged 440 billion euros to the fund .

international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn hailed the package as a big step forward , and said the imf would be happy to contribute should eurozone countries require additional help from beyond the european central bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 10.05.2010 merkel 's coalition suffers big defeat in key state election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier ruettgers suffered a ' bitter ' defeat german chancellor angela merkel 's center-right coalition parties have suffered huge losses in elections in north rhine-westphalia , robbing her government of a majority in the upper house of parliament . results from sunday 's poll show merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- won 34.6 percent of the vote , down a full 10 percentage points from the last election in 2005 and their worst showing ever in the state .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were only marginally behind , winning 34.5 percent of the vote . the business-friendly free democrats , the cdu 's current coalition partner in north rhine-westphalia and at the national level , gained half a percentage point , winning 6.7 percent of the vote .
the environmentalist greens did the best , almost doubling their showing from the last state election , securing 12.1 percent .
the left party won 5.6 percent , and is now poised to enter the nrw state parliament for the first time .
the election outcome means that the opposition social democrats and the green party could narrowly form a governing coalition in germany 's most populous state with a slim one-vote majority , but would likely require support from the left party . the alternatives are a coalition between the cdu and the greens , a grand coalition of spd and cdu , a so-called ' jamaica ' alliance between the cdu , greens and fdp , or a ' traffic light ' coalition between the spd , greens and fdp .
a failed test the nrw state election was the first litmus test for chancellor merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp government . the loss in north rhine-westphalia has cost her government its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
the debacle in nrw will make it considerably harder for merkel to push through parliament key reforms and tax cuts needed to revitalize europe 's largest economy .
the election comes just days after the german bundestag approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
" this is a bitter defeat for the cdu in the state and federally , " gerd langguth , political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency . " it is also an object lesson for the performance of the federal government , especially for the fdp , " he added . " the greek aid package also had an effect .
people are n't happy about germany being europe 's paymaster , " he said . results that ca n't be ignored spd and green leaders took the election results as a sign of bigger changes to come in the country 's political landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft celebrates with other spd members " the spd is back ! "
social democrat candidate hannelore kraft told supporters as the first results came in . " an spd-green alliance is what north rhine-westphalia wants ! "
the co-chair of the greens , claudia roth , said the vote was the payback for the government 's decisions in berlin .
" for the federal cdu-fdp coalition , my friends , this is the beginning of the end , " she said .
a leading member of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach , also said the loss for the conservatives was a sign of bigger issues .
" i can only warn the cdu against trying to put a positive spin on this result , " he said .
" it is a huge disappointment . "
according to german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who also leads the fdp , the coalition government wo n't ignore these results , describing them as a " warning shot " by voters .
" citizens need to know that we have heard their message , " he said .
" we must redouble our efforts to win back the lost confidence in our work . " gb / afp / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 10.05.2010 five years on , berlin holocaust memorial is a landmark of remembrance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin holocaust memorial was a long time in the making now five years old , berlin 's holocaust memorial serves as a landmark of remembrance and a symbol of collective conscience - even as the structure threatens to crumble .
dw looks at the memorial 's past , present and future . in 1953 - in the wake of the holocaust - a first order of business for the young israeli state was the construction of the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem .
forty years later , washington , d.c. built its holocaust memorial .
yet it was n't until 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii , that germany , the atrocity 's perpetrator , unveiled its memorial to the murdered jews of europe . it 's been five years since the holocaust memorial opened at the center of berlin .
support and appreciation for the monument - which caused 13 years of heated debate and may now be disintegrating - is stronger than ever . a grassroots proposal the idea for the memorial first came at the beginning of 1989 through a citizens ' initiative in berlin , spearheaded by journalist and publicist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
the group wanted to see a national memorial to the jews who perished in the holocaust built in berlin , which was the capital of east germany at the time . with the fall of the berlin wall a few months later and the excitement of germany 's reunification shortly thereafter , the idea was almost immediately placed on the backburner .
a few years later , in 1992 , chancellor helmut kohl 's government became proponents of the memorial 's construction and set aside space for it next to berlin 's brandenburg gate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect peter eisenman says he could n't have done it without rosh 's support in bonn , still the capital of west germany , many parliamentarians fought for the monument to be built .
among them was christian democrat norbert lammert , who is now head of the memorial 's curatorial committee . lammert says that he and several others " emphatically advocated that the government 's move to berlin after reunification needed to begin with such a demonstrative sign . " but the monument itself would not be realized for quite some time .
after rounds of hearings , debates , competitions and exhibitions , the german parliament finally decided to create a foundation to decide on and implement a design for the memorial . throughout this process and the further debates that ensued , the memorial 's conceptualists , rosh and jaeckel , remained clear on what they wanted their brainchild to accomplish .
" we wanted the memorial to do three things , " rosh told deutsche welle : " to commemorate what took place , to honor the victims and to give them back their names . " the fruits of a long labor today , the monument does just that .
spreading over 19,000 square meters -lrb- over 200,000 square feet -rrb- in the middle of berlin , the memorial to the murdered jews of europe is made up of 2,711 gray , concrete steles of varying heights - a seemingly endless landscape of concrete waves that ca n't be overlooked . some critics found the monument too abstract and anonymous , so an information center was later added beneath the terrain , where visitors can learn about the holocaust and its victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial , located at the heart of berlin , is facing serious renovation the monument 's designer , american architect peter eisenman , has not been back to the memorial since its opening in may 2005 , and was originally against the addition of the information center .
now , he is more pleased than ever with his work . " it 's unusual for an american to sit here and say , it was my intention to give you back your memory , " eisenman said .
" it sounds rather condescending , but i think if i had been german , i would have done it and perceived it in the same way . " it was n't an easy road for eisenman ; the memorial that was finally constructed was the second proposal , after the large-scale sculptor richard serra backed out of the project . " i 'm very proud of what we accomplished .
we encountered a great deal of disputes and setbacks .
but lea rosh kept us from giving up , and step by step we got there .
by now , those difficulties have faded into history .
now it 's about the present and the future . looking forward the monument 's future is not fully unproblematic .
recently , faulty construction has begun taking a toll on the concrete pillars , and renovation or partial reconstruction will soon become urgently necessary . uwe neumaerker , the director of the memorial foundation , told deutsche welle he does not know how long the process will take , adding that " tests have shown that unfortunately it will take a very long time . "
still , neumaerker assures that " nothing will fall apart . " more likely than the memorial 's concrete steles falling on visitors , it seems , is visitors falling off steles .
the monument has become a popular destination for games of hide-and-seek , parkour daredevils and sun-worshippers that come on warm days to enjoy the shade-free tops of the steles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial is sometimes used for other purposes rosh takes a relatively relaxed stance toward visitors repurposing her memorial . " sometimes i go and see people sunning themselves on the steles and tell them that there are lawns for sunbathing in the tiergarten just across the street , " she said .
" i tell the boys who are hopping around on the steles that they should do that somewhere else . " when i tell the eight- to 12-year-olds that they should go into the information center below the memorial and then come talk to me about it , it 's always very powerful .
they tell me they 've learned a lot . " author : marcel fuerstenau -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were only marginally behind , winning 34.5 percent of the vote . the business-friendly free democrats , the cdu 's current coalition partner in north rhine-westphalia and at the national level , gained half a percentage point , winning 6.7 percent of the vote .
the environmentalist greens did the best , almost doubling their showing from the last state election , securing 12.1 percent .
the left party won 5.6 percent , and is now poised to enter the nrw state parliament for the first time .
the election outcome means that the opposition social democrats and the green party could narrowly form a governing coalition in germany 's most populous state with a slim one-vote majority , but would likely require support from the left party . the alternatives are a coalition between the cdu and the greens , a grand coalition of spd and cdu , a so-called ' jamaica ' alliance between the cdu , greens and fdp , or a ' traffic light ' coalition between the spd , greens and fdp .

the debacle in nrw will make it considerably harder for merkel to push through parliament key reforms and tax cuts needed to revitalize europe 's largest economy .
the election comes just days after the german bundestag approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
" this is a bitter defeat for the cdu in the state and federally , " gerd langguth , political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency .

those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .
no-names were the stars bildunterschrift : klose had a lot of time for rest and reflection this season the mvp of the season was arjen robben , who brought a whole new level of class to the bundesliga , but otherwise this was not a good year for marquee players .

instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .

maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .

but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .

those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .
no-names were the stars bildunterschrift : klose had a lot of time for rest and reflection this season the mvp of the season was arjen robben , who brought a whole new level of class to the bundesliga , but otherwise this was not a good year for marquee players .
at bayern , van gaal decided he could largely live without luca toni , miroslav klose , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuck , whose services had cost bayern at least 66 million euros -lrb- $ 86 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .
they 'll be playing in the champions league next season .
cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .
comedies of errors bildunterschrift : burchert learned the hard way about the risks of coming out of goal 2009-10 will also be remembered as the year established clubs found new and innovative ways to lose .
no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .
in fact , sometimes german football resembled professional wrestling , with a variety of objects being enlisted to help individuals express their dissatisfaction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero 's aim , in this instance , was good in bochum , a security official was clobbered with a chair , as fans realized they , too , had been relegated .
and down in the second division , hansa rostock supporters hit their own goalkeeper with a tossed firecracker .
but one player fought back .
hamburg striker paolo guerrero beaned a supporter with a water bottle after some unappreciated criticism .
it was one of peruvian 's rare appearances - he missed 28 games due to injury , fear of flying and suspension .
" when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro , " wrote the late , great hunter s. thompson .
but 2009-10 was a year in which once the season got going , the pros turned weird .

instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .
they 'll be playing in the champions league next season .
cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .
comedies of errors bildunterschrift : burchert learned the hard way about the risks of coming out of goal 2009-10 will also be remembered as the year established clubs found new and innovative ways to lose .
no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .
in fact , sometimes german football resembled professional wrestling , with a variety of objects being enlisted to help individuals express their dissatisfaction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero 's aim , in this instance , was good in bochum , a security official was clobbered with a chair , as fans realized they , too , had been relegated .
and down in the second division , hansa rostock supporters hit their own goalkeeper with a tossed firecracker .
but one player fought back .
hamburg striker paolo guerrero beaned a supporter with a water bottle after some unappreciated criticism .
it was one of peruvian 's rare appearances - he missed 28 games due to injury , fear of flying and suspension .
" when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro , " wrote the late , great hunter s. thompson .
but 2009-10 was a year in which once the season got going , the pros turned weird .

a debacle , a german political analyst says . " merkel has to start to think about how she can stay in power and make political decisions until the next federal elections in 2013 , " gero neugebauer , an analyst at the berlin-based otto-suhr-institute of political science , told deutsche welle .
until now , the western german state of north rhine-westphalia was ruled by the same coalition of center-right parties that angela merkel leads in berlin , the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the business-friendly , liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
sunday 's poll is being seen as a damaging referendum on her government in its first electoral test since she won re-election last september .
with both parties returning disappointing results , they no longer hold a majority of seats in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament .
merkel 's coalition is now in for tougher compromise negotiations with the social democratic and green opposition at the federal level when it comes to controversial plans for tax and budget cuts and health-care reform .
less room to maneuver " sixteen state governments and seven different types of coalitions - that has n't been easy in the past , and it will become more difficult in the future , " neugebauer said , adding that the chancellor could also benefit from the election results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's ruettgers could n't bring home the win merkel needed " merkel could use her party 's defeat and that of her coalition partner 's party to put more pressure on the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- to cooperate more closely than before . "
she could tell the liberals to " keep silent and reduce their demands . "
first , however , merkel may have to deal with critics from within her own party .
" the strategy of doing nothing has failed , " josef schlarmann , head of the cdu 's business wing and a member of the party executive told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
the cdu premiers , peter mueller of saarland and christian wulff of lower saxony warned that " business as usual " is not how the coalition government should proceed .
no more dithering a christian democratic politician and former deputy defense minister has called for serious consequences : " resignations are unavoidable to avoid a lingering decline , " willy wimmer told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
merkel must rethink her style of governing , political analyst neugebauer said .
" what she likes most is to sit in the middle and to try to mediate , to negotiate and to bring things together .
what she has to learn is that she ca n't always prevent every crisis - crisis management , that is what has to learn . "
the election debacle comes as eurozone members agreed late on sunday to an unprecedented 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 960 billion -rrb- safety net to ensure the stability of the euro currency .
merkel was scheduled to meet with all party leaders later on monday to discuss the deal , which requires legislative approval .

the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were only marginally behind , winning 34.5 percent of the vote . the business-friendly free democrats , the cdu 's current coalition partner in north rhine-westphalia and at the national level , gained half a percentage point , winning 6.7 percent of the vote .
the environmentalist greens did the best , almost doubling their showing from the last state election , securing 12.1 percent .
the left party won 5.6 percent , and is now poised to enter the nrw state parliament for the first time .
the election outcome means that the opposition social democrats and the green party could narrowly form a governing coalition in germany 's most populous state with a slim one-vote majority , but would likely require support from the left party . the alternatives are a coalition between the cdu and the greens , a grand coalition of spd and cdu , a so-called ' jamaica ' alliance between the cdu , greens and fdp , or a ' traffic light ' coalition between the spd , greens and fdp .
a failed test the nrw state election was the first litmus test for chancellor merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp government . the loss in north rhine-westphalia has cost her government its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
the debacle in nrw will make it considerably harder for merkel to push through parliament key reforms and tax cuts needed to revitalize europe 's largest economy .
the election comes just days after the german bundestag approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
" this is a bitter defeat for the cdu in the state and federally , " gerd langguth , political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency . " it is also an object lesson for the performance of the federal government , especially for the fdp , " he added . " the greek aid package also had an effect .

social democrat candidate hannelore kraft told supporters as the first results came in . " an spd-green alliance is what north rhine-westphalia wants ! "
the co-chair of the greens , claudia roth , said the vote was the payback for the government 's decisions in berlin .

the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were only marginally behind , winning 34.5 percent of the vote . the business-friendly free democrats , the cdu 's current coalition partner in north rhine-westphalia and at the national level , gained half a percentage point , winning 6.7 percent of the vote .
the environmentalist greens did the best , almost doubling their showing from the last state election , securing 12.1 percent .
the left party won 5.6 percent , and is now poised to enter the nrw state parliament for the first time .
the election outcome means that the opposition social democrats and the green party could narrowly form a governing coalition in germany 's most populous state with a slim one-vote majority , but would likely require support from the left party . the alternatives are a coalition between the cdu and the greens , a grand coalition of spd and cdu , a so-called ' jamaica ' alliance between the cdu , greens and fdp , or a ' traffic light ' coalition between the spd , greens and fdp .
a failed test the nrw state election was the first litmus test for chancellor merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp government . the loss in north rhine-westphalia has cost her government its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
the debacle in nrw will make it considerably harder for merkel to push through parliament key reforms and tax cuts needed to revitalize europe 's largest economy .
the election comes just days after the german bundestag approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
" this is a bitter defeat for the cdu in the state and federally , " gerd langguth , political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency . " it is also an object lesson for the performance of the federal government , especially for the fdp , " he added . " the greek aid package also had an effect .
people are n't happy about germany being europe 's paymaster , " he said . results that ca n't be ignored spd and green leaders took the election results as a sign of bigger changes to come in the country 's political landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft celebrates with other spd members " the spd is back ! "
social democrat candidate hannelore kraft told supporters as the first results came in . " an spd-green alliance is what north rhine-westphalia wants ! "
the co-chair of the greens , claudia roth , said the vote was the payback for the government 's decisions in berlin .
" for the federal cdu-fdp coalition , my friends , this is the beginning of the end , " she said .
a leading member of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach , also said the loss for the conservatives was a sign of bigger issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 10.05.2010 oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slick began hitting us shores late last week bp 's 100-ton containment dome failed to funnel oil leaks that have been polluting the gulf of mexico for over two weeks .
as the slick reaches us shores , bp wants you to come up with a solution . the 100-ton containment dome that bp hoped would stop an ongoing oil spill into the gulf of mexico , has failed after clogging with ice crystals .
the dome , which was lowered to the seafloor last thursday , was meant to funnel leaking crude into a rigger .
the oil has been shooting into the gulf at a rate of 5,000 barrels -lrb- 210,000 gallons -rrb- per day , since an april 20 explosion off the coast of louisiana that left 11 missing and presumably dead .
with no quick fix in sight now and the oil slick reaching shorelines , bp is calling on clever non-experts to come up with solutions .
one sure option bp is putting a brave face on their current dilemma , which is bringing them tens of millions of dollars in new lawsuits , and costing them six million dollars -lrb- 4.6 million euros -rrb- in cleanup each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp 's 100-ton containment dome filled with ice crystals instead of funneling oil " i would n't say it 's failed yet , " said doug suttles , bp 's chief operating officer , the day after ice crystals clogged the containment dome .
" what i would say is , what we attempted to do last night did n't work . "
bp is considering using a smaller containment dome that will be less prone to clogging .
admiral thad allen , head of the us coast guard , also told cbs television that a type of plug was also being considered .
" they 're actually going to take a bunch of debris – shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that – and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up and stop the leak . "
however , experts warn that if such a procedure failed , it could cause the flow of the oil to increase exponentially .
the only sure option , geologist lorenz schwark told deutsche welle , is to drill a relief well to intercept the original well and to fill it with very heavy cement that would block the oil 's flow .
this process was used once in the gulf of mexico in 1979 ; at the time taking 10 months .
this time , he estimates , it will take about three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with no quick fix in sight , bp is looking for clever ideas from the public hair-brained schemes ?
publically flummoxed – and threatened by a drastic loss of face – bp has launched the website www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com to collect creative ideas from the general public on how to solve the spill .
submissions are then forwarded to engineers .
bp spokesperson bryan ferguson told reporters in louisiana that he had " no idea " to what extent these suggestions were being worked on , but said that bp had " flown in experts from around the world to collaborate and contemplate the ideas that are presented . "
most of the ideas being presented are probably not feasible , unfortunately .
professor schwark at the university of kiel said that he has received a number of emails himself in recent days from individuals wanting to present him their own ideas .
" most of them were quite drastic , including planting a nuclear device on the seafloor and just blowing up the whole area , " he said .
" i was wondering whether people do consider the effects of such an event if carried out under water in the real world , and not just in a comic film . "
a local initiative some initiatives led by non-experts are already underway along the threatened gulf shoreline .
in walton county , florida , sheriff michael a. adkinson unveiled his plan to protect 42 kilometers of white , sandy beaches .
adkinson has hired a private contractor to float several barges loaded with 1,400 pound -lrb- 635 kilogram -rrb- bales of hay into the gulf , which will then be shredded and blown onto the surface of the water , where he believes it will absorb the oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already doing damage to marine life , the spill threatens shorelines as well as for the source of the problem , schwark said , if his three-month estimation for relief efforts is correct and the oil flow remains constant , the amount spilled will total around 40 thousand tons , equal to the amount of oil leaked during the alaskan exxon-valdez disaster in 1989 – the biggest in us history to date .
schwark added that , given the 80-kilometer -lrb- 50-mile -rrb- distance from the shoreline in this case , he did n't think the overall environmental impact would be as devastating as in alaska .
said mary landry of the us coast guard , " i do n't think any of us know at this time what the impact will be on the environment , or the economic issues that are associated with this spill . "

as the slick reaches us shores , bp wants you to come up with a solution . the 100-ton containment dome that bp hoped would stop an ongoing oil spill into the gulf of mexico , has failed after clogging with ice crystals .
the dome , which was lowered to the seafloor last thursday , was meant to funnel leaking crude into a rigger .
the oil has been shooting into the gulf at a rate of 5,000 barrels -lrb- 210,000 gallons -rrb- per day , since an april 20 explosion off the coast of louisiana that left 11 missing and presumably dead .
with no quick fix in sight now and the oil slick reaching shorelines , bp is calling on clever non-experts to come up with solutions .
one sure option bp is putting a brave face on their current dilemma , which is bringing them tens of millions of dollars in new lawsuits , and costing them six million dollars -lrb- 4.6 million euros -rrb- in cleanup each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp 's 100-ton containment dome filled with ice crystals instead of funneling oil " i would n't say it 's failed yet , " said doug suttles , bp 's chief operating officer , the day after ice crystals clogged the containment dome .
" what i would say is , what we attempted to do last night did n't work . "
bp is considering using a smaller containment dome that will be less prone to clogging .
admiral thad allen , head of the us coast guard , also told cbs television that a type of plug was also being considered .
" they 're actually going to take a bunch of debris – shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that – and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up and stop the leak . "
however , experts warn that if such a procedure failed , it could cause the flow of the oil to increase exponentially .
the only sure option , geologist lorenz schwark told deutsche welle , is to drill a relief well to intercept the original well and to fill it with very heavy cement that would block the oil 's flow .
this process was used once in the gulf of mexico in 1979 ; at the time taking 10 months .
this time , he estimates , it will take about three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with no quick fix in sight , bp is looking for clever ideas from the public hair-brained schemes ?
publically flummoxed – and threatened by a drastic loss of face – bp has launched the website www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com to collect creative ideas from the general public on how to solve the spill .
submissions are then forwarded to engineers .
bp spokesperson bryan ferguson told reporters in louisiana that he had " no idea " to what extent these suggestions were being worked on , but said that bp had " flown in experts from around the world to collaborate and contemplate the ideas that are presented . "
most of the ideas being presented are probably not feasible , unfortunately .
professor schwark at the university of kiel said that he has received a number of emails himself in recent days from individuals wanting to present him their own ideas .
" most of them were quite drastic , including planting a nuclear device on the seafloor and just blowing up the whole area , " he said .
" i was wondering whether people do consider the effects of such an event if carried out under water in the real world , and not just in a comic film . "
a local initiative some initiatives led by non-experts are already underway along the threatened gulf shoreline .
in walton county , florida , sheriff michael a. adkinson unveiled his plan to protect 42 kilometers of white , sandy beaches .
adkinson has hired a private contractor to float several barges loaded with 1,400 pound -lrb- 635 kilogram -rrb- bales of hay into the gulf , which will then be shredded and blown onto the surface of the water , where he believes it will absorb the oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already doing damage to marine life , the spill threatens shorelines as well as for the source of the problem , schwark said , if his three-month estimation for relief efforts is correct and the oil flow remains constant , the amount spilled will total around 40 thousand tons , equal to the amount of oil leaked during the alaskan exxon-valdez disaster in 1989 – the biggest in us history to date .
schwark added that , given the 80-kilometer -lrb- 50-mile -rrb- distance from the shoreline in this case , he did n't think the overall environmental impact would be as devastating as in alaska .

the germans must now beat the undefeated danes to advance . germany put up a good fight but could not resist the finnish assault on monday , losing 1-0 in their second game at the world ice hockey championship in cologne .
finland , who lost their opening match against denmark on saturday , needed to win against host germany to have a chance at making it to the qualifying round .
the group d game remained scoreless until early in the second period , when finland 's jarkko immonen sent the puck zipping into the net off a shot from jussi jokinen .
the germans stepped up their efforts , but despite the support from a capacity crowd of 18,654 they were n't able to break through the defense , giving finland their much-needed win .
the hosts must now beat denmark in their final group match on wednesday to advance , or hope for a finnish victory over the united states on the same day .
denmark pulls off second upset in an earlier game in cologne , the danes went up against the united states in what resulted in the second upset of the tournament , taking down the americans 2-1 with an overtime goal by defenseman stefan lassen .
the win was denmark 's second in the tournament , after trouncing finland 4-1 on saturday .
they are now the first team to reach the second round .
" this is the best danish team ever , " danish nhl player peter regin told reporters following the game .
the us loss was the second consecutive defeat for the americans , who were favored to win before the start of the championship .
the team must win their final match against finland on wednesday in order to avoid the relegation round .
" inexcusable - the us should not be losing these games , " said captain jack johnson .
" now we have a huge game against finland .
we have to start winning games or we 'll find ourselves going home a lot earlier than we should . "
monday 's other games in mannheim saw olympic champions canada rout latvia 6-1 to advance in group b , while switzerland guaranteed their place in the qualifying round with a 3-0 win over italy. cmk / afp / reuters editor : john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the east asian nation has not only become one of sri lanka 's key trade partners and a major military ally , but it has helped the south asian country counter western pressure on issues such as human rights . it has been a year since sri lanka 's army secured victory over the tamil tiger rebels or ltte and the decades ' old civil war came to an end .
this would n't have become possible without the support of sri lanka 's key ally china , many in the south asian nation think .
" china helped the sri lankan state immensely with the war with the ltte when the sri lankan government needed assistance in terms of weapons and ammunition etc , " says si keethaponcalan , an expert from the university of colombo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sri lankan army received ammunition from china during the war diplomatic support the people 's republic 's support came on the diplomatic front as well .
when the west sharply criticized the sri lankan government 's handling of the conflict , particularly the final stages of the war , and the us stopped its military aid over human rights issues , beijing threw its weight behind colombo by blocking a resolution censuring sri lanka at the un security council .
after that the relations between the two traditional allies strengthened further . experts say the basis for the close bilateral ties between the two sides is the fact that china ’ s support to sri lanka is unconditional .
" unlike the western countries and organizations which impose conditions when they give us aid , whether it is the world bank or imf or bilateral aid , the chinese have been giving us aid without asking questions , " says kalyananda godage , a former sri lankan ambassador to the eu . countering india another major reason why sri lanka values this relationship is that china acts as a counterweight to its long-term ally india , says jehan perera , the executive director of the national peace council , a civil rights body in colombo : " india has had a major impact on sri lanka and has pressurized sri lanka in various ways in the past .
so sri lanka would like to have a counterweight of equal size and stature to india to balance it off , " says perera . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lankan gems are world renowned , especially its blue sapphires and cat 's eyes growing chinese investment with almost $ 1 billion in development aid , beijing surpassed tokyo as colombo 's largest foreign donor last year . the chinese are also building a massive port worth almost a billion us dollars in hambantota on sri lanka 's southeastern coast .
some western media have reported that china would like to use it as a naval base .
but the sri lankan government has insisted that the purpose of the port is purely commercial . " china has a huge navy . it is now an emerging superpower and its trade is huge with the west .
china needs energy supplies from the middle east .
and all of this passes via sri lanka because of our location in the indian ocean .
so that has become very important , " says former diplomat godage . exciting market the emerging superpower has also become an increasingly important trading partner for the sri lankans .
gems , jewelry , tea and natural rubber are areas where colombo sees potential for the bilateral trade to grow further . " it is a market that is going to mature , " says shezard careem , one of the leading gem traders in colombo .
" it is tremendously wealthy and a luxury market as well .
it provides a whole gamut of opportunities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of sri lankans follow buddhism human rights : an ' internal issue ' while china and its western partners have differences over issues such as human rights in china , many in sri lanka consider this as china 's internal matter . " we are not going to be concerned about china 's human rights record , they can look after that , " says godage .
" we are interested in a good mutually beneficial relationship which also looks after our security , economic and political interests .
so we are very happy with our relationship with china . " the urge to not to lose or upset this ' valuable ' partner is so huge that sri lanka , a predominantly buddhist country , even stopped two of its cricket players from meeting the dalai lama in india recently . author : disha uppal editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the red shirts hold suthep responsible for a clash with soldiers which left 25 people dead on april 10 , as he was in charge of security matters at that time .
suthep has denied responsibility for the deadly clash that was triggered by an unsuccessful attempt to remove the protesters by force .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 10.05.2010 oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slick began hitting us shores late last week bp 's 100-ton containment dome failed to funnel oil leaks that have been polluting the gulf of mexico for over two weeks .
as the slick reaches us shores , bp wants you to come up with a solution . the 100-ton containment dome that bp hoped would stop an ongoing oil spill into the gulf of mexico , has failed after clogging with ice crystals .
the dome , which was lowered to the seafloor last thursday , was meant to funnel leaking crude into a rigger .
the oil has been shooting into the gulf at a rate of 5,000 barrels -lrb- 210,000 gallons -rrb- per day , since an april 20 explosion off the coast of louisiana that left 11 missing and presumably dead .
with no quick fix in sight now and the oil slick reaching shorelines , bp is calling on clever non-experts to come up with solutions .
one sure option bp is putting a brave face on their current dilemma , which is bringing them tens of millions of dollars in new lawsuits , and costing them six million dollars -lrb- 4.6 million euros -rrb- in cleanup each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp 's 100-ton containment dome filled with ice crystals instead of funneling oil " i would n't say it 's failed yet , " said doug suttles , bp 's chief operating officer , the day after ice crystals clogged the containment dome .
" what i would say is , what we attempted to do last night did n't work . "
bp is considering using a smaller containment dome that will be less prone to clogging .
admiral thad allen , head of the us coast guard , also told cbs television that a type of plug was also being considered .
" they 're actually going to take a bunch of debris – shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that – and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up and stop the leak . "
however , experts warn that if such a procedure failed , it could cause the flow of the oil to increase exponentially .
the only sure option , geologist lorenz schwark told deutsche welle , is to drill a relief well to intercept the original well and to fill it with very heavy cement that would block the oil 's flow .
this process was used once in the gulf of mexico in 1979 ; at the time taking 10 months .
this time , he estimates , it will take about three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with no quick fix in sight , bp is looking for clever ideas from the public hair-brained schemes ?
publically flummoxed – and threatened by a drastic loss of face – bp has launched the website www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com to collect creative ideas from the general public on how to solve the spill .
submissions are then forwarded to engineers .
bp spokesperson bryan ferguson told reporters in louisiana that he had " no idea " to what extent these suggestions were being worked on , but said that bp had " flown in experts from around the world to collaborate and contemplate the ideas that are presented . "
most of the ideas being presented are probably not feasible , unfortunately .
professor schwark at the university of kiel said that he has received a number of emails himself in recent days from individuals wanting to present him their own ideas .
" most of them were quite drastic , including planting a nuclear device on the seafloor and just blowing up the whole area , " he said .
" i was wondering whether people do consider the effects of such an event if carried out under water in the real world , and not just in a comic film . "
a local initiative some initiatives led by non-experts are already underway along the threatened gulf shoreline .
in walton county , florida , sheriff michael a. adkinson unveiled his plan to protect 42 kilometers of white , sandy beaches .
adkinson has hired a private contractor to float several barges loaded with 1,400 pound -lrb- 635 kilogram -rrb- bales of hay into the gulf , which will then be shredded and blown onto the surface of the water , where he believes it will absorb the oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already doing damage to marine life , the spill threatens shorelines as well as for the source of the problem , schwark said , if his three-month estimation for relief efforts is correct and the oil flow remains constant , the amount spilled will total around 40 thousand tons , equal to the amount of oil leaked during the alaskan exxon-valdez disaster in 1989 – the biggest in us history to date .
schwark added that , given the 80-kilometer -lrb- 50-mile -rrb- distance from the shoreline in this case , he did n't think the overall environmental impact would be as devastating as in alaska .
said mary landry of the us coast guard , " i do n't think any of us know at this time what the impact will be on the environment , or the economic issues that are associated with this spill . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 10.05.2010 five years on , berlin holocaust memorial is a landmark of remembrance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin holocaust memorial was a long time in the making now five years old , berlin 's holocaust memorial serves as a landmark of remembrance and a symbol of collective conscience - even as the structure threatens to crumble .
dw looks at the memorial 's past , present and future . in 1953 - in the wake of the holocaust - a first order of business for the young israeli state was the construction of the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem .
forty years later , washington , d.c. built its holocaust memorial .
yet it was n't until 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii , that germany , the atrocity 's perpetrator , unveiled its memorial to the murdered jews of europe . it 's been five years since the holocaust memorial opened at the center of berlin .
support and appreciation for the monument - which caused 13 years of heated debate and may now be disintegrating - is stronger than ever . a grassroots proposal the idea for the memorial first came at the beginning of 1989 through a citizens ' initiative in berlin , spearheaded by journalist and publicist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
the group wanted to see a national memorial to the jews who perished in the holocaust built in berlin , which was the capital of east germany at the time . with the fall of the berlin wall a few months later and the excitement of germany 's reunification shortly thereafter , the idea was almost immediately placed on the backburner .
a few years later , in 1992 , chancellor helmut kohl 's government became proponents of the memorial 's construction and set aside space for it next to berlin 's brandenburg gate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect peter eisenman says he could n't have done it without rosh 's support in bonn , still the capital of west germany , many parliamentarians fought for the monument to be built .
among them was christian democrat norbert lammert , who is now head of the memorial 's curatorial committee . lammert says that he and several others " emphatically advocated that the government 's move to berlin after reunification needed to begin with such a demonstrative sign . " but the monument itself would not be realized for quite some time .
after rounds of hearings , debates , competitions and exhibitions , the german parliament finally decided to create a foundation to decide on and implement a design for the memorial . throughout this process and the further debates that ensued , the memorial 's conceptualists , rosh and jaeckel , remained clear on what they wanted their brainchild to accomplish .
" we wanted the memorial to do three things , " rosh told deutsche welle : " to commemorate what took place , to honor the victims and to give them back their names . " the fruits of a long labor today , the monument does just that .
spreading over 19,000 square meters -lrb- over 200,000 square feet -rrb- in the middle of berlin , the memorial to the murdered jews of europe is made up of 2,711 gray , concrete steles of varying heights - a seemingly endless landscape of concrete waves that ca n't be overlooked . some critics found the monument too abstract and anonymous , so an information center was later added beneath the terrain , where visitors can learn about the holocaust and its victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial , located at the heart of berlin , is facing serious renovation the monument 's designer , american architect peter eisenman , has not been back to the memorial since its opening in may 2005 , and was originally against the addition of the information center .
now , he is more pleased than ever with his work . " it 's unusual for an american to sit here and say , it was my intention to give you back your memory , " eisenman said .
" it sounds rather condescending , but i think if i had been german , i would have done it and perceived it in the same way . " it was n't an easy road for eisenman ; the memorial that was finally constructed was the second proposal , after the large-scale sculptor richard serra backed out of the project . " i 'm very proud of what we accomplished .
we encountered a great deal of disputes and setbacks .
but lea rosh kept us from giving up , and step by step we got there .
by now , those difficulties have faded into history .
now it 's about the present and the future . looking forward the monument 's future is not fully unproblematic .
recently , faulty construction has begun taking a toll on the concrete pillars , and renovation or partial reconstruction will soon become urgently necessary . uwe neumaerker , the director of the memorial foundation , told deutsche welle he does not know how long the process will take , adding that " tests have shown that unfortunately it will take a very long time . "
still , neumaerker assures that " nothing will fall apart . " more likely than the memorial 's concrete steles falling on visitors , it seems , is visitors falling off steles .
the monument has become a popular destination for games of hide-and-seek , parkour daredevils and sun-worshippers that come on warm days to enjoy the shade-free tops of the steles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial is sometimes used for other purposes rosh takes a relatively relaxed stance toward visitors repurposing her memorial . " sometimes i go and see people sunning themselves on the steles and tell them that there are lawns for sunbathing in the tiergarten just across the street , " she said .
" i tell the boys who are hopping around on the steles that they should do that somewhere else . " when i tell the eight- to 12-year-olds that they should go into the information center below the memorial and then come talk to me about it , it 's always very powerful .
they tell me they 've learned a lot . " author : marcel fuerstenau -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" five years ago , ruettgers won the nrw state election not because he was so convincing , but because the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- -green coalition government was doing so poorly .
this time , he lost the election - not because he was doing such a bad job , but because of the government in berlin . " the mass circulation bild zeitung writes in its monday edition that sunday 's state elections marked a " political landslide " in which voters gave merkel 's government a " lesson it will not forget during this term " , which lasts until 2013 .
" boom bang bang - nrw voters taught the christian democrats and free democrats a lesson and changed the country 's political statics , " writes the berliner morgenpost . the slap in the face by germany 's most populous state was meant also for chancellor -lrb- angela -rrb- merkel and her deputy -lrb- guido -rrb- westerwelle , the paper says , adding that in the end , it was most likely the highly unpopular greek bailout package that influenced the voters . the cdu and the fdp have suffered a major defeat , comments the ostsee-zeitung - with grave consequences beyond the state of nrw .
" the end of the cdu-fdp coalition government in nrw marks a turning point for the coalition with the same partners on the federal level as well , " the paper continues .
" the majority in the upper house is gone , and so are major projects : tax reform and extending the life-span of germany 's nuclear power plants .
the wiggle room for angela merkel and her deputy , fdp leader guido westerwelle , has shrunk before they even dared use it . "
the rheinische post also regards the loss of the majority in the upper house , the bundesrat , as a problem for angela merkel and her coalition government .
" no matter who ends up forming the new government in nrw , the chancellor will have to scramble for a majority in the bundesrat in each individual case . " ruettgers is taking the rap for a situation that berlin is really responsible for , writes the donaukurier . " voters in nrw did n't vote against juergen ruettgers ; rather , they showed angela merkel and guido westerwelle the yellow card . losing the majority in the upper house is a just penalty for a never-ending discussion on tax reforms that has paralysed the lower house of parliament for the past six months .

the site , near the kosovo border , was " more proof that serbia does not shy away from its dark past and is ready to bring to justice all those who have committed crimes , " said prosecutor vladimir vukcevic .
during the two-year conflict , serb forces controlled by former strongman slobodan milosevic transported the remains of hundreds of ethnic albanian civilians to several locations in serbia in a bid to cover up mass killings and war crimes .
in 2001 , the remains of more than 830 kosovo albanians were found at three sites in serbia .
over 700 bodies have since been uncovered in a mass grave located in a suburb of the capital , belgrade .
dozens more were found in the towns of petrovo selo and perucac .
the exhumation of bodies from the raska site is expected to begin soon when an evaluation of the crime scene is completed .

the site , near the kosovo border , was " more proof that serbia does not shy away from its dark past and is ready to bring to justice all those who have committed crimes , " said prosecutor vladimir vukcevic .
during the two-year conflict , serb forces controlled by former strongman slobodan milosevic transported the remains of hundreds of ethnic albanian civilians to several locations in serbia in a bid to cover up mass killings and war crimes .
in 2001 , the remains of more than 830 kosovo albanians were found at three sites in serbia .
over 700 bodies have since been uncovered in a mass grave located in a suburb of the capital , belgrade .
dozens more were found in the towns of petrovo selo and perucac .
the exhumation of bodies from the raska site is expected to begin soon when an evaluation of the crime scene is completed .
a former top police official and serbian deputy interior minister during the kosovo conflict , vlastimir djordjevic , is believed to have ordered the vast cover-up .
djordjevic is currently standing trial at the un war crimes tribunal in the hague. gb / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw looks at the memorial 's past , present and future . in 1953 - in the wake of the holocaust - a first order of business for the young israeli state was the construction of the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem .
forty years later , washington , d.c. built its holocaust memorial .
yet it was n't until 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii , that germany , the atrocity 's perpetrator , unveiled its memorial to the murdered jews of europe . it 's been five years since the holocaust memorial opened at the center of berlin .
support and appreciation for the monument - which caused 13 years of heated debate and may now be disintegrating - is stronger than ever . a grassroots proposal the idea for the memorial first came at the beginning of 1989 through a citizens ' initiative in berlin , spearheaded by journalist and publicist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
the group wanted to see a national memorial to the jews who perished in the holocaust built in berlin , which was the capital of east germany at the time . with the fall of the berlin wall a few months later and the excitement of germany 's reunification shortly thereafter , the idea was almost immediately placed on the backburner .
a few years later , in 1992 , chancellor helmut kohl 's government became proponents of the memorial 's construction and set aside space for it next to berlin 's brandenburg gate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect peter eisenman says he could n't have done it without rosh 's support in bonn , still the capital of west germany , many parliamentarians fought for the monument to be built .
among them was christian democrat norbert lammert , who is now head of the memorial 's curatorial committee . lammert says that he and several others " emphatically advocated that the government 's move to berlin after reunification needed to begin with such a demonstrative sign . " but the monument itself would not be realized for quite some time .
after rounds of hearings , debates , competitions and exhibitions , the german parliament finally decided to create a foundation to decide on and implement a design for the memorial . throughout this process and the further debates that ensued , the memorial 's conceptualists , rosh and jaeckel , remained clear on what they wanted their brainchild to accomplish .
" we wanted the memorial to do three things , " rosh told deutsche welle : " to commemorate what took place , to honor the victims and to give them back their names . " the fruits of a long labor today , the monument does just that .
spreading over 19,000 square meters -lrb- over 200,000 square feet -rrb- in the middle of berlin , the memorial to the murdered jews of europe is made up of 2,711 gray , concrete steles of varying heights - a seemingly endless landscape of concrete waves that ca n't be overlooked . some critics found the monument too abstract and anonymous , so an information center was later added beneath the terrain , where visitors can learn about the holocaust and its victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial , located at the heart of berlin , is facing serious renovation the monument 's designer , american architect peter eisenman , has not been back to the memorial since its opening in may 2005 , and was originally against the addition of the information center .
now , he is more pleased than ever with his work . " it 's unusual for an american to sit here and say , it was my intention to give you back your memory , " eisenman said .
" it sounds rather condescending , but i think if i had been german , i would have done it and perceived it in the same way . " it was n't an easy road for eisenman ; the memorial that was finally constructed was the second proposal , after the large-scale sculptor richard serra backed out of the project . " i 'm very proud of what we accomplished .
we encountered a great deal of disputes and setbacks .
but lea rosh kept us from giving up , and step by step we got there .
by now , those difficulties have faded into history .
now it 's about the present and the future . looking forward the monument 's future is not fully unproblematic .
recently , faulty construction has begun taking a toll on the concrete pillars , and renovation or partial reconstruction will soon become urgently necessary . uwe neumaerker , the director of the memorial foundation , told deutsche welle he does not know how long the process will take , adding that " tests have shown that unfortunately it will take a very long time . "
still , neumaerker assures that " nothing will fall apart . " more likely than the memorial 's concrete steles falling on visitors , it seems , is visitors falling off steles .

the funds will be used to rescue any eurozone country that gets into serious financial difficulty . news of the proposed eurozone stability package saw markets rise worldwide on monday , which was just the sort of reaction that european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund had hoped for .
frankfurt 's dax closed the day up 5.3 percent , london 's ftse 100 index ended the day up 5.16 percent , while in paris , the cac-40 soared to close up by 9.66 percent .
in new york , the dow jones jumped by more than four percent in early trading .
the euro shot up by 1.5 cents against the us dollar after the announcement of the deal , then fell slightly to 1.28 dollars as the markets waited to see if member nations would follow through with austerity measures .
this followed a 14-month low against the dollar last week , amid uncertainty that the bloc would rescue greece , spain and portugal from possible default . the markets were reacting to an announcement made by european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund in brussels early on monday , that they had agreed on the creation of permanent measures worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 964 billion -rrb- to bail out eurozone states that run into financial difficulty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has already secured a 110 billion-euro loan package from the eurozone and the imf under the plan , the european commission is to provide 60 billion euros , while members of the 16-nation eurozone have pledged 440 billion euros to the fund .
the imf is to contribute an additional 250 billion euros , said spanish finance minister elena salgado .
german chancellor angela merkel said that the nearly trillion-dollar package would serve to " strengthen and protect " the euro .
she said that the eurozone must actively resolve its stability problem " at the roots " by pressing member states to balance their budgets .
" budget consolidation in all member states is extraordinarily important , " said merkel .
the chancellor also welcomed new austerity measures promised by the spanish government , saying they send an important message to the markets .
washington has praised europe 's stabilization plans . one white house official said president barack obama supports " assertive action " to address the greek debt crisis , and that european leaders have his support .
calming the markets the european commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , olli rehn , said the massive bailout " proves that we will defend the euro , whatever it takes . "
the european central bank will also implement exceptional measures in support of the package , the eu 's top economic official said on monday .
international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn hailed the package as a big step forward , and said the imf would be happy to contribute should eurozone countries require additional help from beyond the european central bank .
calming the fears of international markets appears to be the main goal of the package , but swedish finance minister anders borg described the situation more bluntly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets seem to approve of the eurozone measures " we now see herd behavior in the markets that is really pack behavior , wolf pack behavior , " borg told reporters .
" if we will not stop these packs , they will tear the weaker countries apart . "
meanwhile , britain 's chancellor of the exchequer , alistair darling , said the package was a " good deal " for europe , and that it was in the best interests of britain 's banks and export market .
however , darling did make it clear that this was a problem for the eurogroup .
" what we ca n't do is provide support for the euro , " said darling .
" that 's got to be for those countries that use the euro that are members of the eurogroup . "
awkward timing the euro stabilization deal comes just as state elections in germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , have taken away merkel 's majority in the upper house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disapproval of the greek bailout could have been one of the factors to the cdu 's majority loss the results of the election in north rhine-westphalia were seen by some as a reaction to merkel 's reluctant support of the eu 's greek bailout , which is unpopular with many voters in germany .
nevertheless , merkel stressed the measures were needed to protect the euro and german incomes .
" it is the first time in the history of the euro and the eu , and we are protecting our currency in an extraordinary situation , " said merkel .
" i can also put it this way to the population : we are protecting the money of the people in germany . "
the european commission is planning to meet on wednesday to determine how to strengthen eu budget rules and economic surveillance in the eurozone to avoid a future crisis. mk / gb / apf / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the funds will be used to rescue any eurozone country that gets into serious financial difficulty . news of the proposed eurozone stability package saw markets rise worldwide on monday , which was just the sort of reaction that european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund had hoped for .
frankfurt 's dax closed the day up 5.3 percent , london 's ftse 100 index ended the day up 5.16 percent , while in paris , the cac-40 soared to close up by 9.66 percent .
in new york , the dow jones jumped by more than four percent in early trading .
the euro shot up by 1.5 cents against the us dollar after the announcement of the deal , then fell slightly to 1.28 dollars as the markets waited to see if member nations would follow through with austerity measures .
this followed a 14-month low against the dollar last week , amid uncertainty that the bloc would rescue greece , spain and portugal from possible default . the markets were reacting to an announcement made by european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund in brussels early on monday , that they had agreed on the creation of permanent measures worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 964 billion -rrb- to bail out eurozone states that run into financial difficulty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has already secured a 110 billion-euro loan package from the eurozone and the imf under the plan , the european commission is to provide 60 billion euros , while members of the 16-nation eurozone have pledged 440 billion euros to the fund .
the imf is to contribute an additional 250 billion euros , said spanish finance minister elena salgado .
german chancellor angela merkel said that the nearly trillion-dollar package would serve to " strengthen and protect " the euro .
she said that the eurozone must actively resolve its stability problem " at the roots " by pressing member states to balance their budgets .
" budget consolidation in all member states is extraordinarily important , " said merkel .
the chancellor also welcomed new austerity measures promised by the spanish government , saying they send an important message to the markets .
washington has praised europe 's stabilization plans . one white house official said president barack obama supports " assertive action " to address the greek debt crisis , and that european leaders have his support .
calming the markets the european commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , olli rehn , said the massive bailout " proves that we will defend the euro , whatever it takes . "
the european central bank will also implement exceptional measures in support of the package , the eu 's top economic official said on monday .
international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn hailed the package as a big step forward , and said the imf would be happy to contribute should eurozone countries require additional help from beyond the european central bank .
calming the fears of international markets appears to be the main goal of the package , but swedish finance minister anders borg described the situation more bluntly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets seem to approve of the eurozone measures " we now see herd behavior in the markets that is really pack behavior , wolf pack behavior , " borg told reporters .
" if we will not stop these packs , they will tear the weaker countries apart . "
meanwhile , britain 's chancellor of the exchequer , alistair darling , said the package was a " good deal " for europe , and that it was in the best interests of britain 's banks and export market .
however , darling did make it clear that this was a problem for the eurogroup .
" what we ca n't do is provide support for the euro , " said darling .
" that 's got to be for those countries that use the euro that are members of the eurogroup . "
awkward timing the euro stabilization deal comes just as state elections in germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , have taken away merkel 's majority in the upper house of parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : disapproval of the greek bailout could have been one of the factors to the cdu 's majority loss the results of the election in north rhine-westphalia were seen by some as a reaction to merkel 's reluctant support of the eu 's greek bailout , which is unpopular with many voters in germany .
nevertheless , merkel stressed the measures were needed to protect the euro and german incomes .
" it is the first time in the history of the euro and the eu , and we are protecting our currency in an extraordinary situation , " said merkel .
" i can also put it this way to the population : we are protecting the money of the people in germany . "
the european commission is planning to meet on wednesday to determine how to strengthen eu budget rules and economic surveillance in the eurozone to avoid a future crisis. mk / gb / apf / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 10.05.2010 oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slick began hitting us shores late last week bp 's 100-ton containment dome failed to funnel oil leaks that have been polluting the gulf of mexico for over two weeks .
as the slick reaches us shores , bp wants you to come up with a solution . the 100-ton containment dome that bp hoped would stop an ongoing oil spill into the gulf of mexico , has failed after clogging with ice crystals .
the dome , which was lowered to the seafloor last thursday , was meant to funnel leaking crude into a rigger .
the oil has been shooting into the gulf at a rate of 5,000 barrels -lrb- 210,000 gallons -rrb- per day , since an april 20 explosion off the coast of louisiana that left 11 missing and presumably dead .
with no quick fix in sight now and the oil slick reaching shorelines , bp is calling on clever non-experts to come up with solutions .
one sure option bp is putting a brave face on their current dilemma , which is bringing them tens of millions of dollars in new lawsuits , and costing them six million dollars -lrb- 4.6 million euros -rrb- in cleanup each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp 's 100-ton containment dome filled with ice crystals instead of funneling oil " i would n't say it 's failed yet , " said doug suttles , bp 's chief operating officer , the day after ice crystals clogged the containment dome .
" what i would say is , what we attempted to do last night did n't work . "
bp is considering using a smaller containment dome that will be less prone to clogging .
admiral thad allen , head of the us coast guard , also told cbs television that a type of plug was also being considered .
" they 're actually going to take a bunch of debris – shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that – and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up and stop the leak . "
however , experts warn that if such a procedure failed , it could cause the flow of the oil to increase exponentially .
the only sure option , geologist lorenz schwark told deutsche welle , is to drill a relief well to intercept the original well and to fill it with very heavy cement that would block the oil 's flow .
this process was used once in the gulf of mexico in 1979 ; at the time taking 10 months .
this time , he estimates , it will take about three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with no quick fix in sight , bp is looking for clever ideas from the public hair-brained schemes ?
publically flummoxed – and threatened by a drastic loss of face – bp has launched the website www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com to collect creative ideas from the general public on how to solve the spill .
submissions are then forwarded to engineers .
bp spokesperson bryan ferguson told reporters in louisiana that he had " no idea " to what extent these suggestions were being worked on , but said that bp had " flown in experts from around the world to collaborate and contemplate the ideas that are presented . "
most of the ideas being presented are probably not feasible , unfortunately .
professor schwark at the university of kiel said that he has received a number of emails himself in recent days from individuals wanting to present him their own ideas .
" most of them were quite drastic , including planting a nuclear device on the seafloor and just blowing up the whole area , " he said .
" i was wondering whether people do consider the effects of such an event if carried out under water in the real world , and not just in a comic film . "
a local initiative some initiatives led by non-experts are already underway along the threatened gulf shoreline .
in walton county , florida , sheriff michael a. adkinson unveiled his plan to protect 42 kilometers of white , sandy beaches .
adkinson has hired a private contractor to float several barges loaded with 1,400 pound -lrb- 635 kilogram -rrb- bales of hay into the gulf , which will then be shredded and blown onto the surface of the water , where he believes it will absorb the oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already doing damage to marine life , the spill threatens shorelines as well as for the source of the problem , schwark said , if his three-month estimation for relief efforts is correct and the oil flow remains constant , the amount spilled will total around 40 thousand tons , equal to the amount of oil leaked during the alaskan exxon-valdez disaster in 1989 – the biggest in us history to date .
schwark added that , given the 80-kilometer -lrb- 50-mile -rrb- distance from the shoreline in this case , he did n't think the overall environmental impact would be as devastating as in alaska .
said mary landry of the us coast guard , " i do n't think any of us know at this time what the impact will be on the environment , or the economic issues that are associated with this spill . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 10.05.2010 merkel 's coalition suffers big defeat in key state election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : state premier ruettgers suffered a ' bitter ' defeat german chancellor angela merkel 's center-right coalition parties have suffered huge losses in elections in north rhine-westphalia , robbing her government of a majority in the upper house of parliament . results from sunday 's poll show merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- won 34.6 percent of the vote , down a full 10 percentage points from the last election in 2005 and their worst showing ever in the state .
the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were only marginally behind , winning 34.5 percent of the vote . the business-friendly free democrats , the cdu 's current coalition partner in north rhine-westphalia and at the national level , gained half a percentage point , winning 6.7 percent of the vote .
the environmentalist greens did the best , almost doubling their showing from the last state election , securing 12.1 percent .
the left party won 5.6 percent , and is now poised to enter the nrw state parliament for the first time .
the election outcome means that the opposition social democrats and the green party could narrowly form a governing coalition in germany 's most populous state with a slim one-vote majority , but would likely require support from the left party . the alternatives are a coalition between the cdu and the greens , a grand coalition of spd and cdu , a so-called ' jamaica ' alliance between the cdu , greens and fdp , or a ' traffic light ' coalition between the spd , greens and fdp .
a failed test the nrw state election was the first litmus test for chancellor merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp government . the loss in north rhine-westphalia has cost her government its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
the debacle in nrw will make it considerably harder for merkel to push through parliament key reforms and tax cuts needed to revitalize europe 's largest economy .
the election comes just days after the german bundestag approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
" this is a bitter defeat for the cdu in the state and federally , " gerd langguth , political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency . " it is also an object lesson for the performance of the federal government , especially for the fdp , " he added . " the greek aid package also had an effect .
people are n't happy about germany being europe 's paymaster , " he said . results that ca n't be ignored spd and green leaders took the election results as a sign of bigger changes to come in the country 's political landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft celebrates with other spd members " the spd is back ! "
social democrat candidate hannelore kraft told supporters as the first results came in . " an spd-green alliance is what north rhine-westphalia wants ! "
the co-chair of the greens , claudia roth , said the vote was the payback for the government 's decisions in berlin .
" for the federal cdu-fdp coalition , my friends , this is the beginning of the end , " she said .
a leading member of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach , also said the loss for the conservatives was a sign of bigger issues .
" i can only warn the cdu against trying to put a positive spin on this result , " he said .
" it is a huge disappointment . "
according to german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who also leads the fdp , the coalition government wo n't ignore these results , describing them as a " warning shot " by voters .
" citizens need to know that we have heard their message , " he said .

the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were only marginally behind , winning 34.5 percent of the vote . the business-friendly free democrats , the cdu 's current coalition partner in north rhine-westphalia and at the national level , gained half a percentage point , winning 6.7 percent of the vote .
the environmentalist greens did the best , almost doubling their showing from the last state election , securing 12.1 percent .
the left party won 5.6 percent , and is now poised to enter the nrw state parliament for the first time .
the election outcome means that the opposition social democrats and the green party could narrowly form a governing coalition in germany 's most populous state with a slim one-vote majority , but would likely require support from the left party . the alternatives are a coalition between the cdu and the greens , a grand coalition of spd and cdu , a so-called ' jamaica ' alliance between the cdu , greens and fdp , or a ' traffic light ' coalition between the spd , greens and fdp .
a failed test the nrw state election was the first litmus test for chancellor merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp government . the loss in north rhine-westphalia has cost her government its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
the debacle in nrw will make it considerably harder for merkel to push through parliament key reforms and tax cuts needed to revitalize europe 's largest economy .
the election comes just days after the german bundestag approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
" this is a bitter defeat for the cdu in the state and federally , " gerd langguth , political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency . " it is also an object lesson for the performance of the federal government , especially for the fdp , " he added . " the greek aid package also had an effect .
people are n't happy about germany being europe 's paymaster , " he said . results that ca n't be ignored spd and green leaders took the election results as a sign of bigger changes to come in the country 's political landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft celebrates with other spd members " the spd is back ! "
social democrat candidate hannelore kraft told supporters as the first results came in . " an spd-green alliance is what north rhine-westphalia wants ! "
the co-chair of the greens , claudia roth , said the vote was the payback for the government 's decisions in berlin .
" for the federal cdu-fdp coalition , my friends , this is the beginning of the end , " she said .
a leading member of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach , also said the loss for the conservatives was a sign of bigger issues .
" i can only warn the cdu against trying to put a positive spin on this result , " he said .
" it is a huge disappointment . "
according to german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who also leads the fdp , the coalition government wo n't ignore these results , describing them as a " warning shot " by voters .

the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were only marginally behind , winning 34.5 percent of the vote . the business-friendly free democrats , the cdu 's current coalition partner in north rhine-westphalia and at the national level , gained half a percentage point , winning 6.7 percent of the vote .
the environmentalist greens did the best , almost doubling their showing from the last state election , securing 12.1 percent .
the left party won 5.6 percent , and is now poised to enter the nrw state parliament for the first time .
the election outcome means that the opposition social democrats and the green party could narrowly form a governing coalition in germany 's most populous state with a slim one-vote majority , but would likely require support from the left party . the alternatives are a coalition between the cdu and the greens , a grand coalition of spd and cdu , a so-called ' jamaica ' alliance between the cdu , greens and fdp , or a ' traffic light ' coalition between the spd , greens and fdp .

dw looks at the memorial 's past , present and future . in 1953 - in the wake of the holocaust - a first order of business for the young israeli state was the construction of the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem .
forty years later , washington , d.c. built its holocaust memorial .
yet it was n't until 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii , that germany , the atrocity 's perpetrator , unveiled its memorial to the murdered jews of europe . it 's been five years since the holocaust memorial opened at the center of berlin .
support and appreciation for the monument - which caused 13 years of heated debate and may now be disintegrating - is stronger than ever . a grassroots proposal the idea for the memorial first came at the beginning of 1989 through a citizens ' initiative in berlin , spearheaded by journalist and publicist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
the group wanted to see a national memorial to the jews who perished in the holocaust built in berlin , which was the capital of east germany at the time . with the fall of the berlin wall a few months later and the excitement of germany 's reunification shortly thereafter , the idea was almost immediately placed on the backburner .
a few years later , in 1992 , chancellor helmut kohl 's government became proponents of the memorial 's construction and set aside space for it next to berlin 's brandenburg gate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect peter eisenman says he could n't have done it without rosh 's support in bonn , still the capital of west germany , many parliamentarians fought for the monument to be built .
among them was christian democrat norbert lammert , who is now head of the memorial 's curatorial committee . lammert says that he and several others " emphatically advocated that the government 's move to berlin after reunification needed to begin with such a demonstrative sign . " but the monument itself would not be realized for quite some time .
after rounds of hearings , debates , competitions and exhibitions , the german parliament finally decided to create a foundation to decide on and implement a design for the memorial . throughout this process and the further debates that ensued , the memorial 's conceptualists , rosh and jaeckel , remained clear on what they wanted their brainchild to accomplish .
" we wanted the memorial to do three things , " rosh told deutsche welle : " to commemorate what took place , to honor the victims and to give them back their names . " the fruits of a long labor today , the monument does just that .
spreading over 19,000 square meters -lrb- over 200,000 square feet -rrb- in the middle of berlin , the memorial to the murdered jews of europe is made up of 2,711 gray , concrete steles of varying heights - a seemingly endless landscape of concrete waves that ca n't be overlooked . some critics found the monument too abstract and anonymous , so an information center was later added beneath the terrain , where visitors can learn about the holocaust and its victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial , located at the heart of berlin , is facing serious renovation the monument 's designer , american architect peter eisenman , has not been back to the memorial since its opening in may 2005 , and was originally against the addition of the information center .
now , he is more pleased than ever with his work . " it 's unusual for an american to sit here and say , it was my intention to give you back your memory , " eisenman said .
" it sounds rather condescending , but i think if i had been german , i would have done it and perceived it in the same way . " it was n't an easy road for eisenman ; the memorial that was finally constructed was the second proposal , after the large-scale sculptor richard serra backed out of the project . " i 'm very proud of what we accomplished .
we encountered a great deal of disputes and setbacks .
but lea rosh kept us from giving up , and step by step we got there .
by now , those difficulties have faded into history .
now it 's about the present and the future . looking forward the monument 's future is not fully unproblematic .
recently , faulty construction has begun taking a toll on the concrete pillars , and renovation or partial reconstruction will soon become urgently necessary . uwe neumaerker , the director of the memorial foundation , told deutsche welle he does not know how long the process will take , adding that " tests have shown that unfortunately it will take a very long time . "
still , neumaerker assures that " nothing will fall apart . " more likely than the memorial 's concrete steles falling on visitors , it seems , is visitors falling off steles .
the monument has become a popular destination for games of hide-and-seek , parkour daredevils and sun-worshippers that come on warm days to enjoy the shade-free tops of the steles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial is sometimes used for other purposes rosh takes a relatively relaxed stance toward visitors repurposing her memorial . " sometimes i go and see people sunning themselves on the steles and tell them that there are lawns for sunbathing in the tiergarten just across the street , " she said .
" i tell the boys who are hopping around on the steles that they should do that somewhere else . " when i tell the eight- to 12-year-olds that they should go into the information center below the memorial and then come talk to me about it , it 's always very powerful .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 10.05.2010 oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slick began hitting us shores late last week bp 's 100-ton containment dome failed to funnel oil leaks that have been polluting the gulf of mexico for over two weeks .
as the slick reaches us shores , bp wants you to come up with a solution . the 100-ton containment dome that bp hoped would stop an ongoing oil spill into the gulf of mexico , has failed after clogging with ice crystals .
the dome , which was lowered to the seafloor last thursday , was meant to funnel leaking crude into a rigger .
the oil has been shooting into the gulf at a rate of 5,000 barrels -lrb- 210,000 gallons -rrb- per day , since an april 20 explosion off the coast of louisiana that left 11 missing and presumably dead .
with no quick fix in sight now and the oil slick reaching shorelines , bp is calling on clever non-experts to come up with solutions .
one sure option bp is putting a brave face on their current dilemma , which is bringing them tens of millions of dollars in new lawsuits , and costing them six million dollars -lrb- 4.6 million euros -rrb- in cleanup each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp 's 100-ton containment dome filled with ice crystals instead of funneling oil " i would n't say it 's failed yet , " said doug suttles , bp 's chief operating officer , the day after ice crystals clogged the containment dome .
" what i would say is , what we attempted to do last night did n't work . "
bp is considering using a smaller containment dome that will be less prone to clogging .
admiral thad allen , head of the us coast guard , also told cbs television that a type of plug was also being considered .
" they 're actually going to take a bunch of debris – shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that – and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up and stop the leak . "
however , experts warn that if such a procedure failed , it could cause the flow of the oil to increase exponentially .
the only sure option , geologist lorenz schwark told deutsche welle , is to drill a relief well to intercept the original well and to fill it with very heavy cement that would block the oil 's flow .
this process was used once in the gulf of mexico in 1979 ; at the time taking 10 months .
this time , he estimates , it will take about three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with no quick fix in sight , bp is looking for clever ideas from the public hair-brained schemes ?
publically flummoxed – and threatened by a drastic loss of face – bp has launched the website www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com to collect creative ideas from the general public on how to solve the spill .
submissions are then forwarded to engineers .
bp spokesperson bryan ferguson told reporters in louisiana that he had " no idea " to what extent these suggestions were being worked on , but said that bp had " flown in experts from around the world to collaborate and contemplate the ideas that are presented . "
most of the ideas being presented are probably not feasible , unfortunately .
professor schwark at the university of kiel said that he has received a number of emails himself in recent days from individuals wanting to present him their own ideas .
" most of them were quite drastic , including planting a nuclear device on the seafloor and just blowing up the whole area , " he said .
" i was wondering whether people do consider the effects of such an event if carried out under water in the real world , and not just in a comic film . "
a local initiative some initiatives led by non-experts are already underway along the threatened gulf shoreline .
in walton county , florida , sheriff michael a. adkinson unveiled his plan to protect 42 kilometers of white , sandy beaches .
adkinson has hired a private contractor to float several barges loaded with 1,400 pound -lrb- 635 kilogram -rrb- bales of hay into the gulf , which will then be shredded and blown onto the surface of the water , where he believes it will absorb the oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already doing damage to marine life , the spill threatens shorelines as well as for the source of the problem , schwark said , if his three-month estimation for relief efforts is correct and the oil flow remains constant , the amount spilled will total around 40 thousand tons , equal to the amount of oil leaked during the alaskan exxon-valdez disaster in 1989 – the biggest in us history to date .
schwark added that , given the 80-kilometer -lrb- 50-mile -rrb- distance from the shoreline in this case , he did n't think the overall environmental impact would be as devastating as in alaska .
said mary landry of the us coast guard , " i do n't think any of us know at this time what the impact will be on the environment , or the economic issues that are associated with this spill . "

those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .
no-names were the stars bildunterschrift : klose had a lot of time for rest and reflection this season the mvp of the season was arjen robben , who brought a whole new level of class to the bundesliga , but otherwise this was not a good year for marquee players .
at bayern , van gaal decided he could largely live without luca toni , miroslav klose , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuck , whose services had cost bayern at least 66 million euros -lrb- $ 86 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .
they 'll be playing in the champions league next season .
cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .
comedies of errors bildunterschrift : burchert learned the hard way about the risks of coming out of goal 2009-10 will also be remembered as the year established clubs found new and innovative ways to lose .
no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .
in fact , sometimes german football resembled professional wrestling , with a variety of objects being enlisted to help individuals express their dissatisfaction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero 's aim , in this instance , was good in bochum , a security official was clobbered with a chair , as fans realized they , too , had been relegated .
and down in the second division , hansa rostock supporters hit their own goalkeeper with a tossed firecracker .
but one player fought back .
hamburg striker paolo guerrero beaned a supporter with a water bottle after some unappreciated criticism .
it was one of peruvian 's rare appearances - he missed 28 games due to injury , fear of flying and suspension .
" when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro , " wrote the late , great hunter s. thompson .
but 2009-10 was a year in which once the season got going , the pros turned weird .

those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .
no-names were the stars bildunterschrift : klose had a lot of time for rest and reflection this season the mvp of the season was arjen robben , who brought a whole new level of class to the bundesliga , but otherwise this was not a good year for marquee players .
at bayern , van gaal decided he could largely live without luca toni , miroslav klose , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuck , whose services had cost bayern at least 66 million euros -lrb- $ 86 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .
they 'll be playing in the champions league next season .
cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .
comedies of errors bildunterschrift : burchert learned the hard way about the risks of coming out of goal 2009-10 will also be remembered as the year established clubs found new and innovative ways to lose .
no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .
in fact , sometimes german football resembled professional wrestling , with a variety of objects being enlisted to help individuals express their dissatisfaction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero 's aim , in this instance , was good in bochum , a security official was clobbered with a chair , as fans realized they , too , had been relegated .
and down in the second division , hansa rostock supporters hit their own goalkeeper with a tossed firecracker .
but one player fought back .
hamburg striker paolo guerrero beaned a supporter with a water bottle after some unappreciated criticism .
it was one of peruvian 's rare appearances - he missed 28 games due to injury , fear of flying and suspension .
" when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro , " wrote the late , great hunter s. thompson .
but 2009-10 was a year in which once the season got going , the pros turned weird .

no-names were the stars bildunterschrift : klose had a lot of time for rest and reflection this season the mvp of the season was arjen robben , who brought a whole new level of class to the bundesliga , but otherwise this was not a good year for marquee players .
at bayern , van gaal decided he could largely live without luca toni , miroslav klose , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuck , whose services had cost bayern at least 66 million euros -lrb- $ 86 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .
they 'll be playing in the champions league next season .
cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .
comedies of errors bildunterschrift : burchert learned the hard way about the risks of coming out of goal 2009-10 will also be remembered as the year established clubs found new and innovative ways to lose .
no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .
in fact , sometimes german football resembled professional wrestling , with a variety of objects being enlisted to help individuals express their dissatisfaction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero 's aim , in this instance , was good in bochum , a security official was clobbered with a chair , as fans realized they , too , had been relegated .
and down in the second division , hansa rostock supporters hit their own goalkeeper with a tossed firecracker .
but one player fought back .
hamburg striker paolo guerrero beaned a supporter with a water bottle after some unappreciated criticism .
it was one of peruvian 's rare appearances - he missed 28 games due to injury , fear of flying and suspension .
" when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro , " wrote the late , great hunter s. thompson .
but 2009-10 was a year in which once the season got going , the pros turned weird .

those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 10.05.2010 oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slick began hitting us shores late last week bp 's 100-ton containment dome failed to funnel oil leaks that have been polluting the gulf of mexico for over two weeks .
as the slick reaches us shores , bp wants you to come up with a solution . the 100-ton containment dome that bp hoped would stop an ongoing oil spill into the gulf of mexico , has failed after clogging with ice crystals .
the dome , which was lowered to the seafloor last thursday , was meant to funnel leaking crude into a rigger .
the oil has been shooting into the gulf at a rate of 5,000 barrels -lrb- 210,000 gallons -rrb- per day , since an april 20 explosion off the coast of louisiana that left 11 missing and presumably dead .
with no quick fix in sight now and the oil slick reaching shorelines , bp is calling on clever non-experts to come up with solutions .
one sure option bp is putting a brave face on their current dilemma , which is bringing them tens of millions of dollars in new lawsuits , and costing them six million dollars -lrb- 4.6 million euros -rrb- in cleanup each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp 's 100-ton containment dome filled with ice crystals instead of funneling oil " i would n't say it 's failed yet , " said doug suttles , bp 's chief operating officer , the day after ice crystals clogged the containment dome .
" what i would say is , what we attempted to do last night did n't work . "
bp is considering using a smaller containment dome that will be less prone to clogging .
admiral thad allen , head of the us coast guard , also told cbs television that a type of plug was also being considered .
" they 're actually going to take a bunch of debris – shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that – and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up and stop the leak . "
however , experts warn that if such a procedure failed , it could cause the flow of the oil to increase exponentially .
the only sure option , geologist lorenz schwark told deutsche welle , is to drill a relief well to intercept the original well and to fill it with very heavy cement that would block the oil 's flow .
this process was used once in the gulf of mexico in 1979 ; at the time taking 10 months .
this time , he estimates , it will take about three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with no quick fix in sight , bp is looking for clever ideas from the public hair-brained schemes ?
publically flummoxed – and threatened by a drastic loss of face – bp has launched the website www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com to collect creative ideas from the general public on how to solve the spill .
submissions are then forwarded to engineers .
bp spokesperson bryan ferguson told reporters in louisiana that he had " no idea " to what extent these suggestions were being worked on , but said that bp had " flown in experts from around the world to collaborate and contemplate the ideas that are presented . "
most of the ideas being presented are probably not feasible , unfortunately .
professor schwark at the university of kiel said that he has received a number of emails himself in recent days from individuals wanting to present him their own ideas .
" most of them were quite drastic , including planting a nuclear device on the seafloor and just blowing up the whole area , " he said .
" i was wondering whether people do consider the effects of such an event if carried out under water in the real world , and not just in a comic film . "
a local initiative some initiatives led by non-experts are already underway along the threatened gulf shoreline .
in walton county , florida , sheriff michael a. adkinson unveiled his plan to protect 42 kilometers of white , sandy beaches .
adkinson has hired a private contractor to float several barges loaded with 1,400 pound -lrb- 635 kilogram -rrb- bales of hay into the gulf , which will then be shredded and blown onto the surface of the water , where he believes it will absorb the oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already doing damage to marine life , the spill threatens shorelines as well as for the source of the problem , schwark said , if his three-month estimation for relief efforts is correct and the oil flow remains constant , the amount spilled will total around 40 thousand tons , equal to the amount of oil leaked during the alaskan exxon-valdez disaster in 1989 – the biggest in us history to date .
schwark added that , given the 80-kilometer -lrb- 50-mile -rrb- distance from the shoreline in this case , he did n't think the overall environmental impact would be as devastating as in alaska .
said mary landry of the us coast guard , " i do n't think any of us know at this time what the impact will be on the environment , or the economic issues that are associated with this spill . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 10.05.2010 chancellor merkel faces tougher times großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel must now rethink her style of governing , some say sunday 's huge losses in a state poll have cost chancellor merkel 's coalition its majority in the upper house of parliament , putting the brakes on berlin 's reform agenda .
a debacle , a german political analyst says . " merkel has to start to think about how she can stay in power and make political decisions until the next federal elections in 2013 , " gero neugebauer , an analyst at the berlin-based otto-suhr-institute of political science , told deutsche welle .
until now , the western german state of north rhine-westphalia was ruled by the same coalition of center-right parties that angela merkel leads in berlin , the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the business-friendly , liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
sunday 's poll is being seen as a damaging referendum on her government in its first electoral test since she won re-election last september .
with both parties returning disappointing results , they no longer hold a majority of seats in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament .
merkel 's coalition is now in for tougher compromise negotiations with the social democratic and green opposition at the federal level when it comes to controversial plans for tax and budget cuts and health-care reform .
less room to maneuver " sixteen state governments and seven different types of coalitions - that has n't been easy in the past , and it will become more difficult in the future , " neugebauer said , adding that the chancellor could also benefit from the election results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's ruettgers could n't bring home the win merkel needed " merkel could use her party 's defeat and that of her coalition partner 's party to put more pressure on the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- to cooperate more closely than before . "
she could tell the liberals to " keep silent and reduce their demands . "
first , however , merkel may have to deal with critics from within her own party .
" the strategy of doing nothing has failed , " josef schlarmann , head of the cdu 's business wing and a member of the party executive told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
the cdu premiers , peter mueller of saarland and christian wulff of lower saxony warned that " business as usual " is not how the coalition government should proceed .
no more dithering a christian democratic politician and former deputy defense minister has called for serious consequences : " resignations are unavoidable to avoid a lingering decline , " willy wimmer told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
merkel must rethink her style of governing , political analyst neugebauer said .
" what she likes most is to sit in the middle and to try to mediate , to negotiate and to bring things together .
what she has to learn is that she ca n't always prevent every crisis - crisis management , that is what has to learn . "
the election debacle comes as eurozone members agreed late on sunday to an unprecedented 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 960 billion -rrb- safety net to ensure the stability of the euro currency .
merkel was scheduled to meet with all party leaders later on monday to discuss the deal , which requires legislative approval .

a debacle , a german political analyst says . " merkel has to start to think about how she can stay in power and make political decisions until the next federal elections in 2013 , " gero neugebauer , an analyst at the berlin-based otto-suhr-institute of political science , told deutsche welle .
until now , the western german state of north rhine-westphalia was ruled by the same coalition of center-right parties that angela merkel leads in berlin , the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the business-friendly , liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
sunday 's poll is being seen as a damaging referendum on her government in its first electoral test since she won re-election last september .
with both parties returning disappointing results , they no longer hold a majority of seats in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament .
merkel 's coalition is now in for tougher compromise negotiations with the social democratic and green opposition at the federal level when it comes to controversial plans for tax and budget cuts and health-care reform .
less room to maneuver " sixteen state governments and seven different types of coalitions - that has n't been easy in the past , and it will become more difficult in the future , " neugebauer said , adding that the chancellor could also benefit from the election results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's ruettgers could n't bring home the win merkel needed " merkel could use her party 's defeat and that of her coalition partner 's party to put more pressure on the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- to cooperate more closely than before . "
she could tell the liberals to " keep silent and reduce their demands . "
first , however , merkel may have to deal with critics from within her own party .
" the strategy of doing nothing has failed , " josef schlarmann , head of the cdu 's business wing and a member of the party executive told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
the cdu premiers , peter mueller of saarland and christian wulff of lower saxony warned that " business as usual " is not how the coalition government should proceed .
no more dithering a christian democratic politician and former deputy defense minister has called for serious consequences : " resignations are unavoidable to avoid a lingering decline , " willy wimmer told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
merkel must rethink her style of governing , political analyst neugebauer said .
" what she likes most is to sit in the middle and to try to mediate , to negotiate and to bring things together .
what she has to learn is that she ca n't always prevent every crisis - crisis management , that is what has to learn . "
the election debacle comes as eurozone members agreed late on sunday to an unprecedented 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 960 billion -rrb- safety net to ensure the stability of the euro currency .
merkel was scheduled to meet with all party leaders later on monday to discuss the deal , which requires legislative approval .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 10.05.2010 oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slick began hitting us shores late last week bp 's 100-ton containment dome failed to funnel oil leaks that have been polluting the gulf of mexico for over two weeks .
as the slick reaches us shores , bp wants you to come up with a solution . the 100-ton containment dome that bp hoped would stop an ongoing oil spill into the gulf of mexico , has failed after clogging with ice crystals .
the dome , which was lowered to the seafloor last thursday , was meant to funnel leaking crude into a rigger .
the oil has been shooting into the gulf at a rate of 5,000 barrels -lrb- 210,000 gallons -rrb- per day , since an april 20 explosion off the coast of louisiana that left 11 missing and presumably dead .
with no quick fix in sight now and the oil slick reaching shorelines , bp is calling on clever non-experts to come up with solutions .
one sure option bp is putting a brave face on their current dilemma , which is bringing them tens of millions of dollars in new lawsuits , and costing them six million dollars -lrb- 4.6 million euros -rrb- in cleanup each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp 's 100-ton containment dome filled with ice crystals instead of funneling oil " i would n't say it 's failed yet , " said doug suttles , bp 's chief operating officer , the day after ice crystals clogged the containment dome .
" what i would say is , what we attempted to do last night did n't work . "
bp is considering using a smaller containment dome that will be less prone to clogging .
admiral thad allen , head of the us coast guard , also told cbs television that a type of plug was also being considered .
" they 're actually going to take a bunch of debris – shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that – and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up and stop the leak . "
however , experts warn that if such a procedure failed , it could cause the flow of the oil to increase exponentially .
the only sure option , geologist lorenz schwark told deutsche welle , is to drill a relief well to intercept the original well and to fill it with very heavy cement that would block the oil 's flow .
this process was used once in the gulf of mexico in 1979 ; at the time taking 10 months .
this time , he estimates , it will take about three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with no quick fix in sight , bp is looking for clever ideas from the public hair-brained schemes ?
publically flummoxed – and threatened by a drastic loss of face – bp has launched the website www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com to collect creative ideas from the general public on how to solve the spill .
submissions are then forwarded to engineers .
bp spokesperson bryan ferguson told reporters in louisiana that he had " no idea " to what extent these suggestions were being worked on , but said that bp had " flown in experts from around the world to collaborate and contemplate the ideas that are presented . "
most of the ideas being presented are probably not feasible , unfortunately .
professor schwark at the university of kiel said that he has received a number of emails himself in recent days from individuals wanting to present him their own ideas .
" most of them were quite drastic , including planting a nuclear device on the seafloor and just blowing up the whole area , " he said .
" i was wondering whether people do consider the effects of such an event if carried out under water in the real world , and not just in a comic film . "
a local initiative some initiatives led by non-experts are already underway along the threatened gulf shoreline .
in walton county , florida , sheriff michael a. adkinson unveiled his plan to protect 42 kilometers of white , sandy beaches .
adkinson has hired a private contractor to float several barges loaded with 1,400 pound -lrb- 635 kilogram -rrb- bales of hay into the gulf , which will then be shredded and blown onto the surface of the water , where he believes it will absorb the oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already doing damage to marine life , the spill threatens shorelines as well as for the source of the problem , schwark said , if his three-month estimation for relief efforts is correct and the oil flow remains constant , the amount spilled will total around 40 thousand tons , equal to the amount of oil leaked during the alaskan exxon-valdez disaster in 1989 – the biggest in us history to date .
schwark added that , given the 80-kilometer -lrb- 50-mile -rrb- distance from the shoreline in this case , he did n't think the overall environmental impact would be as devastating as in alaska .
said mary landry of the us coast guard , " i do n't think any of us know at this time what the impact will be on the environment , or the economic issues that are associated with this spill . "

she could tell the liberals to " keep silent and reduce their demands . "
first , however , merkel may have to deal with critics from within her own party .
" the strategy of doing nothing has failed , " josef schlarmann , head of the cdu 's business wing and a member of the party executive told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
the cdu premiers , peter mueller of saarland and christian wulff of lower saxony warned that " business as usual " is not how the coalition government should proceed .

" what she likes most is to sit in the middle and to try to mediate , to negotiate and to bring things together .
what she has to learn is that she ca n't always prevent every crisis - crisis management , that is what has to learn . "
the election debacle comes as eurozone members agreed late on sunday to an unprecedented 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 960 billion -rrb- safety net to ensure the stability of the euro currency .
merkel was scheduled to meet with all party leaders later on monday to discuss the deal , which requires legislative approval .

a debacle , a german political analyst says . " merkel has to start to think about how she can stay in power and make political decisions until the next federal elections in 2013 , " gero neugebauer , an analyst at the berlin-based otto-suhr-institute of political science , told deutsche welle .
until now , the western german state of north rhine-westphalia was ruled by the same coalition of center-right parties that angela merkel leads in berlin , the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the business-friendly , liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
sunday 's poll is being seen as a damaging referendum on her government in its first electoral test since she won re-election last september .
with both parties returning disappointing results , they no longer hold a majority of seats in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament .
merkel 's coalition is now in for tougher compromise negotiations with the social democratic and green opposition at the federal level when it comes to controversial plans for tax and budget cuts and health-care reform .

the funds will be used to rescue any eurozone country that gets into serious financial difficulty . news of the proposed eurozone stability package saw markets rise worldwide on monday , which was just the sort of reaction that european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund had hoped for .
frankfurt 's dax closed the day up 5.3 percent , london 's ftse 100 index ended the day up 5.16 percent , while in paris , the cac-40 soared to close up by 9.66 percent .
in new york , the dow jones jumped by more than four percent in early trading .
the euro shot up by 1.5 cents against the us dollar after the announcement of the deal , then fell slightly to 1.28 dollars as the markets waited to see if member nations would follow through with austerity measures .
this followed a 14-month low against the dollar last week , amid uncertainty that the bloc would rescue greece , spain and portugal from possible default . the markets were reacting to an announcement made by european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund in brussels early on monday , that they had agreed on the creation of permanent measures worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 964 billion -rrb- to bail out eurozone states that run into financial difficulty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has already secured a 110 billion-euro loan package from the eurozone and the imf under the plan , the european commission is to provide 60 billion euros , while members of the 16-nation eurozone have pledged 440 billion euros to the fund .
the imf is to contribute an additional 250 billion euros , said spanish finance minister elena salgado .
german chancellor angela merkel said that the nearly trillion-dollar package would serve to " strengthen and protect " the euro .
she said that the eurozone must actively resolve its stability problem " at the roots " by pressing member states to balance their budgets .
" budget consolidation in all member states is extraordinarily important , " said merkel .
the chancellor also welcomed new austerity measures promised by the spanish government , saying they send an important message to the markets .
washington has praised europe 's stabilization plans . one white house official said president barack obama supports " assertive action " to address the greek debt crisis , and that european leaders have his support .
calming the markets the european commissioner for economic and monetary affairs , olli rehn , said the massive bailout " proves that we will defend the euro , whatever it takes . "
the european central bank will also implement exceptional measures in support of the package , the eu 's top economic official said on monday .
international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn hailed the package as a big step forward , and said the imf would be happy to contribute should eurozone countries require additional help from beyond the european central bank .
calming the fears of international markets appears to be the main goal of the package , but swedish finance minister anders borg described the situation more bluntly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markets seem to approve of the eurozone measures " we now see herd behavior in the markets that is really pack behavior , wolf pack behavior , " borg told reporters .
" if we will not stop these packs , they will tear the weaker countries apart . "
meanwhile , britain 's chancellor of the exchequer , alistair darling , said the package was a " good deal " for europe , and that it was in the best interests of britain 's banks and export market .
however , darling did make it clear that this was a problem for the eurogroup .
" what we ca n't do is provide support for the euro , " said darling .
" that 's got to be for those countries that use the euro that are members of the eurogroup . "
awkward timing the euro stabilization deal comes just as state elections in germany , the eurozone 's largest economy , have taken away merkel 's majority in the upper house of parliament .

nevertheless , merkel stressed the measures were needed to protect the euro and german incomes .

british elections last thursday resulted in a hung parliament , with neither of the major parties - center-left labour and the center-right conservatives - winning a majority in parliament .
nick clegg 's liberal democrat party came in third , allowing it to take on a kingmaker role for whichever of the major parties it chooses to form a coalition with .
the centrist lib dems spent the past three days holding coalition talks with the conservatives , led by david cameron .
brown 's announcement that he would " play no part " in the selection of the next labour leader came as a surprise .
brown said it was " in the interests of the whole country to form a progressive coalition government . "
" the reason we have a hung parliament is that no single party and no single leader was able to win the full support of the country , " brown said .
" as leader of my party , i must accept that that is a judgment on me . "

a debacle , a german political analyst says . " merkel has to start to think about how she can stay in power and make political decisions until the next federal elections in 2013 , " gero neugebauer , an analyst at the berlin-based otto-suhr-institute of political science , told deutsche welle .
until now , the western german state of north rhine-westphalia was ruled by the same coalition of center-right parties that angela merkel leads in berlin , the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the business-friendly , liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
sunday 's poll is being seen as a damaging referendum on her government in its first electoral test since she won re-election last september .
with both parties returning disappointing results , they no longer hold a majority of seats in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament .
merkel 's coalition is now in for tougher compromise negotiations with the social democratic and green opposition at the federal level when it comes to controversial plans for tax and budget cuts and health-care reform .
less room to maneuver " sixteen state governments and seven different types of coalitions - that has n't been easy in the past , and it will become more difficult in the future , " neugebauer said , adding that the chancellor could also benefit from the election results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's ruettgers could n't bring home the win merkel needed " merkel could use her party 's defeat and that of her coalition partner 's party to put more pressure on the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- to cooperate more closely than before . "
she could tell the liberals to " keep silent and reduce their demands . "
first , however , merkel may have to deal with critics from within her own party .
" the strategy of doing nothing has failed , " josef schlarmann , head of the cdu 's business wing and a member of the party executive told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
the cdu premiers , peter mueller of saarland and christian wulff of lower saxony warned that " business as usual " is not how the coalition government should proceed .
no more dithering a christian democratic politician and former deputy defense minister has called for serious consequences : " resignations are unavoidable to avoid a lingering decline , " willy wimmer told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
merkel must rethink her style of governing , political analyst neugebauer said .
" what she likes most is to sit in the middle and to try to mediate , to negotiate and to bring things together .
what she has to learn is that she ca n't always prevent every crisis - crisis management , that is what has to learn . "
the election debacle comes as eurozone members agreed late on sunday to an unprecedented 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 960 billion -rrb- safety net to ensure the stability of the euro currency .
merkel was scheduled to meet with all party leaders later on monday to discuss the deal , which requires legislative approval .

it has shaped population curves all over the world , but not in china , where it ca n't seem to catch on . half a century ago , in the year 1960 , a birth control pill by the name of " evonid " went onto the market in the usa – today , 50 years later , the pill is one of the most important forms of contraception .
it is very popular in europe but in china , on the other hand , it is not so wide-spread .
the birth control pill is stocked on the shelves in every pharmacy in china - right next to nasal spray and pain relievers .
a month 's supply costs just over two euros .
people in china do not need a doctor 's prescription to buy it ; women who are interested just ask a pharmacist .
one woman in a pharmacy in beijing says , " i do n't know what different kinds of pills there are .
i buy the one that the pharmacist suggests - the one with the least amount of side-effects . "
sexual emancipation - in the west when the pill went on the market in the usa in 1960 , china was quick to follow .
a few years later the country came out with its own contraceptive pills .
in the west , the pill was celebrated as sexual emancipation for women , but in china it was seen as merely a new form of contraception that could help slow down the rapid growth of the population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not many young chinese women use the pill for contraception one woman from beijing remembers how the government propagated the pill .
she says , " in the beginning , our work units handed out the pill to us .
you could just go there and get it for free . "
despite being promoted by the government , the pill was never really accepted as a universal form of contraceptive in china , neither in the cities , nor in the country .
according to official chinese statistics , merely two to three percent of chinese women take the pill .
and even those numbers are dwindling .
' throws the body off balance ' women in beijing say they do n't like the pill 's side-effects .
one woman says , " the good thing about the pill is that it makes your skin nice and reduces acne , but it is also unhealthy .
i have heard it can cause vascular diseases in women over 40 and it is also not good for the heart . "
another woman agrees : " i used to take it , but only seldom .
taking the pill is primitive ; there are too many side-effects and it can cause damage to the body .
it throws the body off balance . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six women who did n't take the pill - these ladies flaunt their bumps for the 2008 olympics other methods of contraception are preferred in china , like the contraceptive coil , condoms and plain " being careful " .
but because the latter is far from fool-proof , abortions are also very common .
they are carried out in normal hospitals or in private and often illegal clinics , where prices are very low , as are hygienic standards .
in a regular hospital , an abortion costs around 100 euros and getting an appointment is never a problem .
the patients do not need a doctor 's approval , nor consultation .
more and more young women get abortions , some even get many ; there is no talk of the psychological impact abortions can have .
china is one-of-a-kind in this respect .
it is not likely that china will ever change its policy and promote the pill over abortions .
discussions about the moral implications of killing an unborn child do not officially take place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.05.2010 opinion : berlin holocaust memorial is symbol of historical conscience großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five years after its construction , the berlin memorial to the murdered jews of europe has become part of germany 's political culture , says deutsche welle 's cornelia rabitz . what a long debate has surrounded the berlin holocaust memorial !
first there was the question whether germany even needed such a memorial and then what it should look like .
when american designer peter eisenman finally presented his design after considerable wrangling , the criticism came pouring in .
the memorial contained 2,711 concrete steles .
" too blockish , " complained the critics , " too abstract . "
they said it was just another drop zone for memorial wreaths , an adventure playground for teenaged antics .
a final stroke carved in stone for historical amnesiacs .
even an invitation for neo-nazi vandalism in the middle of berlin .
though the skepticism and concern were understandable , it has become clear over the five years of the monument 's existence that they were unnecessary . the field of pillars lies at the heart of berlin in quick walking distance to the brandenburg gate - arguably germany 's most famous national symbol .
open to visitors at all times , the memorial is not fenced off , there 's no entry fee , and it requires no more from its visitors than a willingness to engage with it .
the underground information center , which was added later , complements the abstract monument by giving the names of the victims and telling their tales of suffering .
some two million people have already visited the center ; many more have walked through the monument above .
even if it is just one more sight to see on their tour of berlin , the number of visitors the memorial receives daily testifies to the monument having become just as part of everyday life as it is part of germany 's larger culture of remembrance .
those who wish to learn more about the holocaust do n't have to look far .
the newly openend " topography of terror " - a sort of counterpart to the memorial - tells the story of the nazis ' crimes against humanity in explicit detail .
meanwhile , the memorial to europe 's murdered jews , remarkable for its abstraction and size , has become part of berlin 's historical landscape .
it is part of a germany-wide network of holocaust museums and memorials that so often commemorate victims ' individual fates .
one should not forget , as the memorial marks its fifth anniversary , that it was not something forced on the country from above or by the descendents of the victims .
nor did its conceptualization begin at an official level .
in fact , the idea was born twenty years ago in a citizens ' initiative spearheaded by journalist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
and so the monument is , in the best sense , a manifestation of personal dedication and historical conscience .
this memorial replaces neither live conversations with those who endured the holcaust , nor the private mourning of individuals .
and it certainly does n't absolve us from our responsibility of coming to terms with the holocaust , national-socialism and war in general in our schools , scholarship and society .
it is , however , an example of how intensively - after a long period of concealment and sugar-coating - germany is dealing with its nazi past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.05.2010 opinion : berlin holocaust memorial is symbol of historical conscience großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five years after its construction , the berlin memorial to the murdered jews of europe has become part of germany 's political culture , says deutsche welle 's cornelia rabitz . what a long debate has surrounded the berlin holocaust memorial !
first there was the question whether germany even needed such a memorial and then what it should look like .
when american designer peter eisenman finally presented his design after considerable wrangling , the criticism came pouring in .
the memorial contained 2,711 concrete steles .
" too blockish , " complained the critics , " too abstract . "
they said it was just another drop zone for memorial wreaths , an adventure playground for teenaged antics .
a final stroke carved in stone for historical amnesiacs .
even an invitation for neo-nazi vandalism in the middle of berlin .
though the skepticism and concern were understandable , it has become clear over the five years of the monument 's existence that they were unnecessary . the field of pillars lies at the heart of berlin in quick walking distance to the brandenburg gate - arguably germany 's most famous national symbol .
open to visitors at all times , the memorial is not fenced off , there 's no entry fee , and it requires no more from its visitors than a willingness to engage with it .
the underground information center , which was added later , complements the abstract monument by giving the names of the victims and telling their tales of suffering .
some two million people have already visited the center ; many more have walked through the monument above .
even if it is just one more sight to see on their tour of berlin , the number of visitors the memorial receives daily testifies to the monument having become just as part of everyday life as it is part of germany 's larger culture of remembrance .
those who wish to learn more about the holocaust do n't have to look far .
the newly openend " topography of terror " - a sort of counterpart to the memorial - tells the story of the nazis ' crimes against humanity in explicit detail .
meanwhile , the memorial to europe 's murdered jews , remarkable for its abstraction and size , has become part of berlin 's historical landscape .
it is part of a germany-wide network of holocaust museums and memorials that so often commemorate victims ' individual fates .
one should not forget , as the memorial marks its fifth anniversary , that it was not something forced on the country from above or by the descendents of the victims .
nor did its conceptualization begin at an official level .
in fact , the idea was born twenty years ago in a citizens ' initiative spearheaded by journalist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
and so the monument is , in the best sense , a manifestation of personal dedication and historical conscience .
this memorial replaces neither live conversations with those who endured the holcaust , nor the private mourning of individuals .
and it certainly does n't absolve us from our responsibility of coming to terms with the holocaust , national-socialism and war in general in our schools , scholarship and society .
it is , however , an example of how intensively - after a long period of concealment and sugar-coating - germany is dealing with its nazi past .

it has shaped population curves all over the world , but not in china , where it ca n't seem to catch on . half a century ago , in the year 1960 , a birth control pill by the name of " evonid " went onto the market in the usa – today , 50 years later , the pill is one of the most important forms of contraception .
it is very popular in europe but in china , on the other hand , it is not so wide-spread .
the birth control pill is stocked on the shelves in every pharmacy in china - right next to nasal spray and pain relievers .
a month 's supply costs just over two euros .
people in china do not need a doctor 's prescription to buy it ; women who are interested just ask a pharmacist .
one woman in a pharmacy in beijing says , " i do n't know what different kinds of pills there are .
i buy the one that the pharmacist suggests - the one with the least amount of side-effects . "
sexual emancipation - in the west when the pill went on the market in the usa in 1960 , china was quick to follow .
a few years later the country came out with its own contraceptive pills .
in the west , the pill was celebrated as sexual emancipation for women , but in china it was seen as merely a new form of contraception that could help slow down the rapid growth of the population .

she says , " in the beginning , our work units handed out the pill to us .

despite being promoted by the government , the pill was never really accepted as a universal form of contraceptive in china , neither in the cities , nor in the country .
according to official chinese statistics , merely two to three percent of chinese women take the pill .
and even those numbers are dwindling .
' throws the body off balance ' women in beijing say they do n't like the pill 's side-effects .
one woman says , " the good thing about the pill is that it makes your skin nice and reduces acne , but it is also unhealthy .
i have heard it can cause vascular diseases in women over 40 and it is also not good for the heart . "
another woman agrees : " i used to take it , but only seldom .
taking the pill is primitive ; there are too many side-effects and it can cause damage to the body .

but because the latter is far from fool-proof , abortions are also very common .
they are carried out in normal hospitals or in private and often illegal clinics , where prices are very low , as are hygienic standards .
in a regular hospital , an abortion costs around 100 euros and getting an appointment is never a problem .
the patients do not need a doctor 's approval , nor consultation .

first there was the question whether germany even needed such a memorial and then what it should look like .
when american designer peter eisenman finally presented his design after considerable wrangling , the criticism came pouring in .
the memorial contained 2,711 concrete steles .
" too blockish , " complained the critics , " too abstract . "
they said it was just another drop zone for memorial wreaths , an adventure playground for teenaged antics .
a final stroke carved in stone for historical amnesiacs .
even an invitation for neo-nazi vandalism in the middle of berlin .
though the skepticism and concern were understandable , it has become clear over the five years of the monument 's existence that they were unnecessary . the field of pillars lies at the heart of berlin in quick walking distance to the brandenburg gate - arguably germany 's most famous national symbol .
open to visitors at all times , the memorial is not fenced off , there 's no entry fee , and it requires no more from its visitors than a willingness to engage with it .
the underground information center , which was added later , complements the abstract monument by giving the names of the victims and telling their tales of suffering .
some two million people have already visited the center ; many more have walked through the monument above .
even if it is just one more sight to see on their tour of berlin , the number of visitors the memorial receives daily testifies to the monument having become just as part of everyday life as it is part of germany 's larger culture of remembrance .
those who wish to learn more about the holocaust do n't have to look far .
the newly openend " topography of terror " - a sort of counterpart to the memorial - tells the story of the nazis ' crimes against humanity in explicit detail .
meanwhile , the memorial to europe 's murdered jews , remarkable for its abstraction and size , has become part of berlin 's historical landscape .
it is part of a germany-wide network of holocaust museums and memorials that so often commemorate victims ' individual fates .
one should not forget , as the memorial marks its fifth anniversary , that it was not something forced on the country from above or by the descendents of the victims .
nor did its conceptualization begin at an official level .
in fact , the idea was born twenty years ago in a citizens ' initiative spearheaded by journalist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
and so the monument is , in the best sense , a manifestation of personal dedication and historical conscience .
this memorial replaces neither live conversations with those who endured the holcaust , nor the private mourning of individuals .
and it certainly does n't absolve us from our responsibility of coming to terms with the holocaust , national-socialism and war in general in our schools , scholarship and society .
it is , however , an example of how intensively - after a long period of concealment and sugar-coating - germany is dealing with its nazi past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 10.05.2010 oil spill efforts fail ; bp calls on general public for suggestions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the slick began hitting us shores late last week bp 's 100-ton containment dome failed to funnel oil leaks that have been polluting the gulf of mexico for over two weeks .
as the slick reaches us shores , bp wants you to come up with a solution . the 100-ton containment dome that bp hoped would stop an ongoing oil spill into the gulf of mexico , has failed after clogging with ice crystals .
the dome , which was lowered to the seafloor last thursday , was meant to funnel leaking crude into a rigger .
the oil has been shooting into the gulf at a rate of 5,000 barrels -lrb- 210,000 gallons -rrb- per day , since an april 20 explosion off the coast of louisiana that left 11 missing and presumably dead .
with no quick fix in sight now and the oil slick reaching shorelines , bp is calling on clever non-experts to come up with solutions .
one sure option bp is putting a brave face on their current dilemma , which is bringing them tens of millions of dollars in new lawsuits , and costing them six million dollars -lrb- 4.6 million euros -rrb- in cleanup each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp 's 100-ton containment dome filled with ice crystals instead of funneling oil " i would n't say it 's failed yet , " said doug suttles , bp 's chief operating officer , the day after ice crystals clogged the containment dome .
" what i would say is , what we attempted to do last night did n't work . "
bp is considering using a smaller containment dome that will be less prone to clogging .
admiral thad allen , head of the us coast guard , also told cbs television that a type of plug was also being considered .
" they 're actually going to take a bunch of debris – shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that – and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up and stop the leak . "
however , experts warn that if such a procedure failed , it could cause the flow of the oil to increase exponentially .
the only sure option , geologist lorenz schwark told deutsche welle , is to drill a relief well to intercept the original well and to fill it with very heavy cement that would block the oil 's flow .
this process was used once in the gulf of mexico in 1979 ; at the time taking 10 months .
this time , he estimates , it will take about three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with no quick fix in sight , bp is looking for clever ideas from the public hair-brained schemes ?
publically flummoxed – and threatened by a drastic loss of face – bp has launched the website www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com to collect creative ideas from the general public on how to solve the spill .
submissions are then forwarded to engineers .
bp spokesperson bryan ferguson told reporters in louisiana that he had " no idea " to what extent these suggestions were being worked on , but said that bp had " flown in experts from around the world to collaborate and contemplate the ideas that are presented . "
most of the ideas being presented are probably not feasible , unfortunately .
professor schwark at the university of kiel said that he has received a number of emails himself in recent days from individuals wanting to present him their own ideas .
" most of them were quite drastic , including planting a nuclear device on the seafloor and just blowing up the whole area , " he said .
" i was wondering whether people do consider the effects of such an event if carried out under water in the real world , and not just in a comic film . "
a local initiative some initiatives led by non-experts are already underway along the threatened gulf shoreline .
in walton county , florida , sheriff michael a. adkinson unveiled his plan to protect 42 kilometers of white , sandy beaches .
adkinson has hired a private contractor to float several barges loaded with 1,400 pound -lrb- 635 kilogram -rrb- bales of hay into the gulf , which will then be shredded and blown onto the surface of the water , where he believes it will absorb the oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already doing damage to marine life , the spill threatens shorelines as well as for the source of the problem , schwark said , if his three-month estimation for relief efforts is correct and the oil flow remains constant , the amount spilled will total around 40 thousand tons , equal to the amount of oil leaked during the alaskan exxon-valdez disaster in 1989 – the biggest in us history to date .
schwark added that , given the 80-kilometer -lrb- 50-mile -rrb- distance from the shoreline in this case , he did n't think the overall environmental impact would be as devastating as in alaska .
said mary landry of the us coast guard , " i do n't think any of us know at this time what the impact will be on the environment , or the economic issues that are associated with this spill . "

the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were only marginally behind , winning 34.5 percent of the vote . the business-friendly free democrats , the cdu 's current coalition partner in north rhine-westphalia and at the national level , gained half a percentage point , winning 6.7 percent of the vote .
the environmentalist greens did the best , almost doubling their showing from the last state election , securing 12.1 percent .
the left party won 5.6 percent , and is now poised to enter the nrw state parliament for the first time .
the election outcome means that the opposition social democrats and the green party could narrowly form a governing coalition in germany 's most populous state with a slim one-vote majority , but would likely require support from the left party . the alternatives are a coalition between the cdu and the greens , a grand coalition of spd and cdu , a so-called ' jamaica ' alliance between the cdu , greens and fdp , or a ' traffic light ' coalition between the spd , greens and fdp .
a failed test the nrw state election was the first litmus test for chancellor merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp government . the loss in north rhine-westphalia has cost her government its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
the debacle in nrw will make it considerably harder for merkel to push through parliament key reforms and tax cuts needed to revitalize europe 's largest economy .
the election comes just days after the german bundestag approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
" this is a bitter defeat for the cdu in the state and federally , " gerd langguth , political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency . " it is also an object lesson for the performance of the federal government , especially for the fdp , " he added . " the greek aid package also had an effect .
people are n't happy about germany being europe 's paymaster , " he said . results that ca n't be ignored spd and green leaders took the election results as a sign of bigger changes to come in the country 's political landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft celebrates with other spd members " the spd is back ! "
social democrat candidate hannelore kraft told supporters as the first results came in . " an spd-green alliance is what north rhine-westphalia wants ! "
the co-chair of the greens , claudia roth , said the vote was the payback for the government 's decisions in berlin .
" for the federal cdu-fdp coalition , my friends , this is the beginning of the end , " she said .
a leading member of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach , also said the loss for the conservatives was a sign of bigger issues .
" i can only warn the cdu against trying to put a positive spin on this result , " he said .
" it is a huge disappointment . "
according to german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who also leads the fdp , the coalition government wo n't ignore these results , describing them as a " warning shot " by voters .
" citizens need to know that we have heard their message , " he said .

" five years ago , ruettgers won the nrw state election not because he was so convincing , but because the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- -green coalition government was doing so poorly .
this time , he lost the election - not because he was doing such a bad job , but because of the government in berlin . " the mass circulation bild zeitung writes in its monday edition that sunday 's state elections marked a " political landslide " in which voters gave merkel 's government a " lesson it will not forget during this term " , which lasts until 2013 .
" boom bang bang - nrw voters taught the christian democrats and free democrats a lesson and changed the country 's political statics , " writes the berliner morgenpost . the slap in the face by germany 's most populous state was meant also for chancellor -lrb- angela -rrb- merkel and her deputy -lrb- guido -rrb- westerwelle , the paper says , adding that in the end , it was most likely the highly unpopular greek bailout package that influenced the voters . the cdu and the fdp have suffered a major defeat , comments the ostsee-zeitung - with grave consequences beyond the state of nrw .

british elections last thursday resulted in a hung parliament , with neither of the major parties - center-left labour and the center-right conservatives - winning a majority in parliament .
nick clegg 's liberal democrat party came in third , allowing it to take on a kingmaker role for whichever of the major parties it chooses to form a coalition with .
the centrist lib dems spent the past three days holding coalition talks with the conservatives , led by david cameron .
brown 's announcement that he would " play no part " in the selection of the next labour leader came as a surprise .
brown said it was " in the interests of the whole country to form a progressive coalition government . "
" the reason we have a hung parliament is that no single party and no single leader was able to win the full support of the country , " brown said .
" as leader of my party , i must accept that that is a judgment on me . "
brown said he hoped that a new leader would be chosen before the party conference in september. svs / dpa / afp editor : send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" five years ago , ruettgers won the nrw state election not because he was so convincing , but because the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- -green coalition government was doing so poorly .
this time , he lost the election - not because he was doing such a bad job , but because of the government in berlin . " the mass circulation bild zeitung writes in its monday edition that sunday 's state elections marked a " political landslide " in which voters gave merkel 's government a " lesson it will not forget during this term " , which lasts until 2013 .
" boom bang bang - nrw voters taught the christian democrats and free democrats a lesson and changed the country 's political statics , " writes the berliner morgenpost . the slap in the face by germany 's most populous state was meant also for chancellor -lrb- angela -rrb- merkel and her deputy -lrb- guido -rrb- westerwelle , the paper says , adding that in the end , it was most likely the highly unpopular greek bailout package that influenced the voters . the cdu and the fdp have suffered a major defeat , comments the ostsee-zeitung - with grave consequences beyond the state of nrw .
" the end of the cdu-fdp coalition government in nrw marks a turning point for the coalition with the same partners on the federal level as well , " the paper continues .
" the majority in the upper house is gone , and so are major projects : tax reform and extending the life-span of germany 's nuclear power plants .
the wiggle room for angela merkel and her deputy , fdp leader guido westerwelle , has shrunk before they even dared use it . "
the rheinische post also regards the loss of the majority in the upper house , the bundesrat , as a problem for angela merkel and her coalition government .
" no matter who ends up forming the new government in nrw , the chancellor will have to scramble for a majority in the bundesrat in each individual case . " ruettgers is taking the rap for a situation that berlin is really responsible for , writes the donaukurier . " voters in nrw did n't vote against juergen ruettgers ; rather , they showed angela merkel and guido westerwelle the yellow card . losing the majority in the upper house is a just penalty for a never-ending discussion on tax reforms that has paralysed the lower house of parliament for the past six months .

the site , near the kosovo border , was " more proof that serbia does not shy away from its dark past and is ready to bring to justice all those who have committed crimes , " said prosecutor vladimir vukcevic .
during the two-year conflict , serb forces controlled by former strongman slobodan milosevic transported the remains of hundreds of ethnic albanian civilians to several locations in serbia in a bid to cover up mass killings and war crimes .
in 2001 , the remains of more than 830 kosovo albanians were found at three sites in serbia .
over 700 bodies have since been uncovered in a mass grave located in a suburb of the capital , belgrade .
dozens more were found in the towns of petrovo selo and perucac .
the exhumation of bodies from the raska site is expected to begin soon when an evaluation of the crime scene is completed .
a former top police official and serbian deputy interior minister during the kosovo conflict , vlastimir djordjevic , is believed to have ordered the vast cover-up .
djordjevic is currently standing trial at the un war crimes tribunal in the hague. gb / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were only marginally behind , winning 34.5 percent of the vote . the business-friendly free democrats , the cdu 's current coalition partner in north rhine-westphalia and at the national level , gained half a percentage point , winning 6.7 percent of the vote .
the environmentalist greens did the best , almost doubling their showing from the last state election , securing 12.1 percent .
the left party won 5.6 percent , and is now poised to enter the nrw state parliament for the first time .
the election outcome means that the opposition social democrats and the green party could narrowly form a governing coalition in germany 's most populous state with a slim one-vote majority , but would likely require support from the left party . the alternatives are a coalition between the cdu and the greens , a grand coalition of spd and cdu , a so-called ' jamaica ' alliance between the cdu , greens and fdp , or a ' traffic light ' coalition between the spd , greens and fdp .

the debacle in nrw will make it considerably harder for merkel to push through parliament key reforms and tax cuts needed to revitalize europe 's largest economy .
the election comes just days after the german bundestag approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
" this is a bitter defeat for the cdu in the state and federally , " gerd langguth , political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency .

the east asian nation has not only become one of sri lanka 's key trade partners and a major military ally , but it has helped the south asian country counter western pressure on issues such as human rights . it has been a year since sri lanka 's army secured victory over the tamil tiger rebels or ltte and the decades ' old civil war came to an end .
this would n't have become possible without the support of sri lanka 's key ally china , many in the south asian nation think .
" china helped the sri lankan state immensely with the war with the ltte when the sri lankan government needed assistance in terms of weapons and ammunition etc , " says si keethaponcalan , an expert from the university of colombo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sri lankan army received ammunition from china during the war diplomatic support the people 's republic 's support came on the diplomatic front as well .
when the west sharply criticized the sri lankan government 's handling of the conflict , particularly the final stages of the war , and the us stopped its military aid over human rights issues , beijing threw its weight behind colombo by blocking a resolution censuring sri lanka at the un security council .
after that the relations between the two traditional allies strengthened further . experts say the basis for the close bilateral ties between the two sides is the fact that china ’ s support to sri lanka is unconditional .
" unlike the western countries and organizations which impose conditions when they give us aid , whether it is the world bank or imf or bilateral aid , the chinese have been giving us aid without asking questions , " says kalyananda godage , a former sri lankan ambassador to the eu . countering india another major reason why sri lanka values this relationship is that china acts as a counterweight to its long-term ally india , says jehan perera , the executive director of the national peace council , a civil rights body in colombo : " india has had a major impact on sri lanka and has pressurized sri lanka in various ways in the past .
so sri lanka would like to have a counterweight of equal size and stature to india to balance it off , " says perera . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lankan gems are world renowned , especially its blue sapphires and cat 's eyes growing chinese investment with almost $ 1 billion in development aid , beijing surpassed tokyo as colombo 's largest foreign donor last year . the chinese are also building a massive port worth almost a billion us dollars in hambantota on sri lanka 's southeastern coast .
some western media have reported that china would like to use it as a naval base .
but the sri lankan government has insisted that the purpose of the port is purely commercial . " china has a huge navy . it is now an emerging superpower and its trade is huge with the west .
china needs energy supplies from the middle east .
and all of this passes via sri lanka because of our location in the indian ocean .
so that has become very important , " says former diplomat godage . exciting market the emerging superpower has also become an increasingly important trading partner for the sri lankans .
gems , jewelry , tea and natural rubber are areas where colombo sees potential for the bilateral trade to grow further . " it is a market that is going to mature , " says shezard careem , one of the leading gem traders in colombo .
" it is tremendously wealthy and a luxury market as well .
it provides a whole gamut of opportunities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of sri lankans follow buddhism human rights : an ' internal issue ' while china and its western partners have differences over issues such as human rights in china , many in sri lanka consider this as china 's internal matter . " we are not going to be concerned about china 's human rights record , they can look after that , " says godage .
" we are interested in a good mutually beneficial relationship which also looks after our security , economic and political interests .
so we are very happy with our relationship with china . " the urge to not to lose or upset this ' valuable ' partner is so huge that sri lanka , a predominantly buddhist country , even stopped two of its cricket players from meeting the dalai lama in india recently . author : disha uppal editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were only marginally behind , winning 34.5 percent of the vote . the business-friendly free democrats , the cdu 's current coalition partner in north rhine-westphalia and at the national level , gained half a percentage point , winning 6.7 percent of the vote .
the environmentalist greens did the best , almost doubling their showing from the last state election , securing 12.1 percent .
the left party won 5.6 percent , and is now poised to enter the nrw state parliament for the first time .
the election outcome means that the opposition social democrats and the green party could narrowly form a governing coalition in germany 's most populous state with a slim one-vote majority , but would likely require support from the left party . the alternatives are a coalition between the cdu and the greens , a grand coalition of spd and cdu , a so-called ' jamaica ' alliance between the cdu , greens and fdp , or a ' traffic light ' coalition between the spd , greens and fdp .
a failed test the nrw state election was the first litmus test for chancellor merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp government . the loss in north rhine-westphalia has cost her government its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
the debacle in nrw will make it considerably harder for merkel to push through parliament key reforms and tax cuts needed to revitalize europe 's largest economy .
the election comes just days after the german bundestag approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
" this is a bitter defeat for the cdu in the state and federally , " gerd langguth , political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency . " it is also an object lesson for the performance of the federal government , especially for the fdp , " he added . " the greek aid package also had an effect .
people are n't happy about germany being europe 's paymaster , " he said . results that ca n't be ignored spd and green leaders took the election results as a sign of bigger changes to come in the country 's political landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft celebrates with other spd members " the spd is back ! "
social democrat candidate hannelore kraft told supporters as the first results came in . " an spd-green alliance is what north rhine-westphalia wants ! "
the co-chair of the greens , claudia roth , said the vote was the payback for the government 's decisions in berlin .
" for the federal cdu-fdp coalition , my friends , this is the beginning of the end , " she said .
a leading member of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach , also said the loss for the conservatives was a sign of bigger issues .
" i can only warn the cdu against trying to put a positive spin on this result , " he said .
" it is a huge disappointment . "
according to german foreign minister guido westerwelle , who also leads the fdp , the coalition government wo n't ignore these results , describing them as a " warning shot " by voters .
" citizens need to know that we have heard their message , " he said .
" we must redouble our efforts to win back the lost confidence in our work . " gb / afp / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a debacle , a german political analyst says . " merkel has to start to think about how she can stay in power and make political decisions until the next federal elections in 2013 , " gero neugebauer , an analyst at the berlin-based otto-suhr-institute of political science , told deutsche welle .
until now , the western german state of north rhine-westphalia was ruled by the same coalition of center-right parties that angela merkel leads in berlin , the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the business-friendly , liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
sunday 's poll is being seen as a damaging referendum on her government in its first electoral test since she won re-election last september .
with both parties returning disappointing results , they no longer hold a majority of seats in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament .
merkel 's coalition is now in for tougher compromise negotiations with the social democratic and green opposition at the federal level when it comes to controversial plans for tax and budget cuts and health-care reform .
less room to maneuver " sixteen state governments and seven different types of coalitions - that has n't been easy in the past , and it will become more difficult in the future , " neugebauer said , adding that the chancellor could also benefit from the election results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's ruettgers could n't bring home the win merkel needed " merkel could use her party 's defeat and that of her coalition partner 's party to put more pressure on the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- to cooperate more closely than before . "
she could tell the liberals to " keep silent and reduce their demands . "
first , however , merkel may have to deal with critics from within her own party .
" the strategy of doing nothing has failed , " josef schlarmann , head of the cdu 's business wing and a member of the party executive told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
the cdu premiers , peter mueller of saarland and christian wulff of lower saxony warned that " business as usual " is not how the coalition government should proceed .
no more dithering a christian democratic politician and former deputy defense minister has called for serious consequences : " resignations are unavoidable to avoid a lingering decline , " willy wimmer told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
merkel must rethink her style of governing , political analyst neugebauer said .
" what she likes most is to sit in the middle and to try to mediate , to negotiate and to bring things together .
what she has to learn is that she ca n't always prevent every crisis - crisis management , that is what has to learn . "
the election debacle comes as eurozone members agreed late on sunday to an unprecedented 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 960 billion -rrb- safety net to ensure the stability of the euro currency .
merkel was scheduled to meet with all party leaders later on monday to discuss the deal , which requires legislative approval .

until now , the western german state of north rhine-westphalia was ruled by the same coalition of center-right parties that angela merkel leads in berlin , the chancellor 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the business-friendly , liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
sunday 's poll is being seen as a damaging referendum on her government in its first electoral test since she won re-election last september .
with both parties returning disappointing results , they no longer hold a majority of seats in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament .
merkel 's coalition is now in for tougher compromise negotiations with the social democratic and green opposition at the federal level when it comes to controversial plans for tax and budget cuts and health-care reform .
less room to maneuver " sixteen state governments and seven different types of coalitions - that has n't been easy in the past , and it will become more difficult in the future , " neugebauer said , adding that the chancellor could also benefit from the election results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's ruettgers could n't bring home the win merkel needed " merkel could use her party 's defeat and that of her coalition partner 's party to put more pressure on the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- to cooperate more closely than before . "
she could tell the liberals to " keep silent and reduce their demands . "
first , however , merkel may have to deal with critics from within her own party .
" the strategy of doing nothing has failed , " josef schlarmann , head of the cdu 's business wing and a member of the party executive told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
the cdu premiers , peter mueller of saarland and christian wulff of lower saxony warned that " business as usual " is not how the coalition government should proceed .
no more dithering a christian democratic politician and former deputy defense minister has called for serious consequences : " resignations are unavoidable to avoid a lingering decline , " willy wimmer told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
merkel must rethink her style of governing , political analyst neugebauer said .
" what she likes most is to sit in the middle and to try to mediate , to negotiate and to bring things together .
what she has to learn is that she ca n't always prevent every crisis - crisis management , that is what has to learn . "
the election debacle comes as eurozone members agreed late on sunday to an unprecedented 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 960 billion -rrb- safety net to ensure the stability of the euro currency .
merkel was scheduled to meet with all party leaders later on monday to discuss the deal , which requires legislative approval .

less room to maneuver " sixteen state governments and seven different types of coalitions - that has n't been easy in the past , and it will become more difficult in the future , " neugebauer said , adding that the chancellor could also benefit from the election results . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu 's ruettgers could n't bring home the win merkel needed " merkel could use her party 's defeat and that of her coalition partner 's party to put more pressure on the liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- to cooperate more closely than before . "
she could tell the liberals to " keep silent and reduce their demands . "
first , however , merkel may have to deal with critics from within her own party .
" the strategy of doing nothing has failed , " josef schlarmann , head of the cdu 's business wing and a member of the party executive told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
the cdu premiers , peter mueller of saarland and christian wulff of lower saxony warned that " business as usual " is not how the coalition government should proceed .
no more dithering a christian democratic politician and former deputy defense minister has called for serious consequences : " resignations are unavoidable to avoid a lingering decline , " willy wimmer told the leipziger volkszeitung newspaper .
merkel must rethink her style of governing , political analyst neugebauer said .
" what she likes most is to sit in the middle and to try to mediate , to negotiate and to bring things together .
what she has to learn is that she ca n't always prevent every crisis - crisis management , that is what has to learn . "
the election debacle comes as eurozone members agreed late on sunday to an unprecedented 750-billion-euro -lrb- $ 960 billion -rrb- safety net to ensure the stability of the euro currency .
merkel was scheduled to meet with all party leaders later on monday to discuss the deal , which requires legislative approval .

those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .
no-names were the stars bildunterschrift : klose had a lot of time for rest and reflection this season the mvp of the season was arjen robben , who brought a whole new level of class to the bundesliga , but otherwise this was not a good year for marquee players .
at bayern , van gaal decided he could largely live without luca toni , miroslav klose , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuck , whose services had cost bayern at least 66 million euros -lrb- $ 86 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .
they 'll be playing in the champions league next season .
cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .
comedies of errors bildunterschrift : burchert learned the hard way about the risks of coming out of goal 2009-10 will also be remembered as the year established clubs found new and innovative ways to lose .
no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .
in fact , sometimes german football resembled professional wrestling , with a variety of objects being enlisted to help individuals express their dissatisfaction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero 's aim , in this instance , was good in bochum , a security official was clobbered with a chair , as fans realized they , too , had been relegated .
and down in the second division , hansa rostock supporters hit their own goalkeeper with a tossed firecracker .
but one player fought back .
hamburg striker paolo guerrero beaned a supporter with a water bottle after some unappreciated criticism .
it was one of peruvian 's rare appearances - he missed 28 games due to injury , fear of flying and suspension .
" when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro , " wrote the late , great hunter s. thompson .
but 2009-10 was a year in which once the season got going , the pros turned weird .

british elections last thursday resulted in a hung parliament , with neither of the major parties - center-left labour and the center-right conservatives - winning a majority in parliament .
nick clegg 's liberal democrat party came in third , allowing it to take on a kingmaker role for whichever of the major parties it chooses to form a coalition with .
the centrist lib dems spent the past three days holding coalition talks with the conservatives , led by david cameron .
brown 's announcement that he would " play no part " in the selection of the next labour leader came as a surprise .
brown said it was " in the interests of the whole country to form a progressive coalition government . "
" the reason we have a hung parliament is that no single party and no single leader was able to win the full support of the country , " brown said .
" as leader of my party , i must accept that that is a judgment on me . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 10.05.2010 2009-10 bundesliga season may have set a new record for weirdness großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took van gaal a while to get a grip on bayern mr. nice guy went on a newspaper tirade , own goals became an art form , and a lot of stuff got thrown at a lot of people .
those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .
no-names were the stars bildunterschrift : klose had a lot of time for rest and reflection this season the mvp of the season was arjen robben , who brought a whole new level of class to the bundesliga , but otherwise this was not a good year for marquee players .
at bayern , van gaal decided he could largely live without luca toni , miroslav klose , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuck , whose services had cost bayern at least 66 million euros -lrb- $ 86 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .
they 'll be playing in the champions league next season .
cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .
comedies of errors bildunterschrift : burchert learned the hard way about the risks of coming out of goal 2009-10 will also be remembered as the year established clubs found new and innovative ways to lose .
no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .
in fact , sometimes german football resembled professional wrestling , with a variety of objects being enlisted to help individuals express their dissatisfaction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero 's aim , in this instance , was good in bochum , a security official was clobbered with a chair , as fans realized they , too , had been relegated .
and down in the second division , hansa rostock supporters hit their own goalkeeper with a tossed firecracker .
but one player fought back .
hamburg striker paolo guerrero beaned a supporter with a water bottle after some unappreciated criticism .
it was one of peruvian 's rare appearances - he missed 28 games due to injury , fear of flying and suspension .
" when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro , " wrote the late , great hunter s. thompson .

the east asian nation has not only become one of sri lanka 's key trade partners and a major military ally , but it has helped the south asian country counter western pressure on issues such as human rights . it has been a year since sri lanka 's army secured victory over the tamil tiger rebels or ltte and the decades ' old civil war came to an end .
this would n't have become possible without the support of sri lanka 's key ally china , many in the south asian nation think .
" china helped the sri lankan state immensely with the war with the ltte when the sri lankan government needed assistance in terms of weapons and ammunition etc , " says si keethaponcalan , an expert from the university of colombo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sri lankan army received ammunition from china during the war diplomatic support the people 's republic 's support came on the diplomatic front as well .
when the west sharply criticized the sri lankan government 's handling of the conflict , particularly the final stages of the war , and the us stopped its military aid over human rights issues , beijing threw its weight behind colombo by blocking a resolution censuring sri lanka at the un security council .
after that the relations between the two traditional allies strengthened further . experts say the basis for the close bilateral ties between the two sides is the fact that china ’ s support to sri lanka is unconditional .
" unlike the western countries and organizations which impose conditions when they give us aid , whether it is the world bank or imf or bilateral aid , the chinese have been giving us aid without asking questions , " says kalyananda godage , a former sri lankan ambassador to the eu . countering india another major reason why sri lanka values this relationship is that china acts as a counterweight to its long-term ally india , says jehan perera , the executive director of the national peace council , a civil rights body in colombo : " india has had a major impact on sri lanka and has pressurized sri lanka in various ways in the past .
so sri lanka would like to have a counterweight of equal size and stature to india to balance it off , " says perera . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lankan gems are world renowned , especially its blue sapphires and cat 's eyes growing chinese investment with almost $ 1 billion in development aid , beijing surpassed tokyo as colombo 's largest foreign donor last year . the chinese are also building a massive port worth almost a billion us dollars in hambantota on sri lanka 's southeastern coast .
some western media have reported that china would like to use it as a naval base .
but the sri lankan government has insisted that the purpose of the port is purely commercial . " china has a huge navy . it is now an emerging superpower and its trade is huge with the west .
china needs energy supplies from the middle east .
and all of this passes via sri lanka because of our location in the indian ocean .
so that has become very important , " says former diplomat godage . exciting market the emerging superpower has also become an increasingly important trading partner for the sri lankans .
gems , jewelry , tea and natural rubber are areas where colombo sees potential for the bilateral trade to grow further . " it is a market that is going to mature , " says shezard careem , one of the leading gem traders in colombo .
" it is tremendously wealthy and a luxury market as well .
it provides a whole gamut of opportunities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of sri lankans follow buddhism human rights : an ' internal issue ' while china and its western partners have differences over issues such as human rights in china , many in sri lanka consider this as china 's internal matter . " we are not going to be concerned about china 's human rights record , they can look after that , " says godage .
" we are interested in a good mutually beneficial relationship which also looks after our security , economic and political interests .
so we are very happy with our relationship with china . " the urge to not to lose or upset this ' valuable ' partner is so huge that sri lanka , a predominantly buddhist country , even stopped two of its cricket players from meeting the dalai lama in india recently . author : disha uppal editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .
no-names were the stars bildunterschrift : klose had a lot of time for rest and reflection this season the mvp of the season was arjen robben , who brought a whole new level of class to the bundesliga , but otherwise this was not a good year for marquee players .
at bayern , van gaal decided he could largely live without luca toni , miroslav klose , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuck , whose services had cost bayern at least 66 million euros -lrb- $ 86 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .
they 'll be playing in the champions league next season .
cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .
comedies of errors bildunterschrift : burchert learned the hard way about the risks of coming out of goal 2009-10 will also be remembered as the year established clubs found new and innovative ways to lose .
no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .
in fact , sometimes german football resembled professional wrestling , with a variety of objects being enlisted to help individuals express their dissatisfaction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero 's aim , in this instance , was good in bochum , a security official was clobbered with a chair , as fans realized they , too , had been relegated .
and down in the second division , hansa rostock supporters hit their own goalkeeper with a tossed firecracker .
but one player fought back .
hamburg striker paolo guerrero beaned a supporter with a water bottle after some unappreciated criticism .
it was one of peruvian 's rare appearances - he missed 28 games due to injury , fear of flying and suspension .
" when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro , " wrote the late , great hunter s. thompson .
but 2009-10 was a year in which once the season got going , the pros turned weird .

the funds will be used to rescue any eurozone country that gets into serious financial difficulty . news of the proposed eurozone stability package saw markets rise worldwide on monday , which was just the sort of reaction that european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund had hoped for .
frankfurt 's dax closed the day up 5.3 percent , london 's ftse 100 index ended the day up 5.16 percent , while in paris , the cac-40 soared to close up by 9.66 percent .
in new york , the dow jones jumped by more than four percent in early trading .
the euro shot up by 1.5 cents against the us dollar after the announcement of the deal , then fell slightly to 1.28 dollars as the markets waited to see if member nations would follow through with austerity measures .
this followed a 14-month low against the dollar last week , amid uncertainty that the bloc would rescue greece , spain and portugal from possible default . the markets were reacting to an announcement made by european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund in brussels early on monday , that they had agreed on the creation of permanent measures worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 964 billion -rrb- to bail out eurozone states that run into financial difficulty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has already secured a 110 billion-euro loan package from the eurozone and the imf under the plan , the european commission is to provide 60 billion euros , while members of the 16-nation eurozone have pledged 440 billion euros to the fund .
the imf is to contribute an additional 250 billion euros , said spanish finance minister elena salgado .
german chancellor angela merkel said that the nearly trillion-dollar package would serve to " strengthen and protect " the euro .
she said that the eurozone must actively resolve its stability problem " at the roots " by pressing member states to balance their budgets .

the euro shot up by 1.5 cents against the us dollar after the announcement of the deal , then fell slightly to 1.28 dollars as the markets waited to see if member nations would follow through with austerity measures .
this followed a 14-month low against the dollar last week , amid uncertainty that the bloc would rescue greece , spain and portugal from possible default . the markets were reacting to an announcement made by european union finance ministers and the international monetary fund in brussels early on monday , that they had agreed on the creation of permanent measures worth 750 billion euros -lrb- $ 964 billion -rrb- to bail out eurozone states that run into financial difficulty . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has already secured a 110 billion-euro loan package from the eurozone and the imf under the plan , the european commission is to provide 60 billion euros , while members of the 16-nation eurozone have pledged 440 billion euros to the fund .

the european central bank will also implement exceptional measures in support of the package , the eu 's top economic official said on monday .
international monetary fund chief dominique strauss-kahn hailed the package as a big step forward , and said the imf would be happy to contribute should eurozone countries require additional help from beyond the european central bank .
calming the fears of international markets appears to be the main goal of the package , but swedish finance minister anders borg described the situation more bluntly .

however , darling did make it clear that this was a problem for the eurogroup .

the east asian nation has not only become one of sri lanka 's key trade partners and a major military ally , but it has helped the south asian country counter western pressure on issues such as human rights . it has been a year since sri lanka 's army secured victory over the tamil tiger rebels or ltte and the decades ' old civil war came to an end .
this would n't have become possible without the support of sri lanka 's key ally china , many in the south asian nation think .
" china helped the sri lankan state immensely with the war with the ltte when the sri lankan government needed assistance in terms of weapons and ammunition etc , " says si keethaponcalan , an expert from the university of colombo .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sri lankan army received ammunition from china during the war diplomatic support the people 's republic 's support came on the diplomatic front as well .
when the west sharply criticized the sri lankan government 's handling of the conflict , particularly the final stages of the war , and the us stopped its military aid over human rights issues , beijing threw its weight behind colombo by blocking a resolution censuring sri lanka at the un security council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 10.05.2010 five years on , berlin holocaust memorial is a landmark of remembrance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin holocaust memorial was a long time in the making now five years old , berlin 's holocaust memorial serves as a landmark of remembrance and a symbol of collective conscience - even as the structure threatens to crumble .
dw looks at the memorial 's past , present and future . in 1953 - in the wake of the holocaust - a first order of business for the young israeli state was the construction of the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem .
forty years later , washington , d.c. built its holocaust memorial .
yet it was n't until 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii , that germany , the atrocity 's perpetrator , unveiled its memorial to the murdered jews of europe . it 's been five years since the holocaust memorial opened at the center of berlin .
support and appreciation for the monument - which caused 13 years of heated debate and may now be disintegrating - is stronger than ever . a grassroots proposal the idea for the memorial first came at the beginning of 1989 through a citizens ' initiative in berlin , spearheaded by journalist and publicist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
the group wanted to see a national memorial to the jews who perished in the holocaust built in berlin , which was the capital of east germany at the time . with the fall of the berlin wall a few months later and the excitement of germany 's reunification shortly thereafter , the idea was almost immediately placed on the backburner .
a few years later , in 1992 , chancellor helmut kohl 's government became proponents of the memorial 's construction and set aside space for it next to berlin 's brandenburg gate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect peter eisenman says he could n't have done it without rosh 's support in bonn , still the capital of west germany , many parliamentarians fought for the monument to be built .
among them was christian democrat norbert lammert , who is now head of the memorial 's curatorial committee . lammert says that he and several others " emphatically advocated that the government 's move to berlin after reunification needed to begin with such a demonstrative sign . " but the monument itself would not be realized for quite some time .
after rounds of hearings , debates , competitions and exhibitions , the german parliament finally decided to create a foundation to decide on and implement a design for the memorial . throughout this process and the further debates that ensued , the memorial 's conceptualists , rosh and jaeckel , remained clear on what they wanted their brainchild to accomplish .
" we wanted the memorial to do three things , " rosh told deutsche welle : " to commemorate what took place , to honor the victims and to give them back their names . " the fruits of a long labor today , the monument does just that .
spreading over 19,000 square meters -lrb- over 200,000 square feet -rrb- in the middle of berlin , the memorial to the murdered jews of europe is made up of 2,711 gray , concrete steles of varying heights - a seemingly endless landscape of concrete waves that ca n't be overlooked . some critics found the monument too abstract and anonymous , so an information center was later added beneath the terrain , where visitors can learn about the holocaust and its victims . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial , located at the heart of berlin , is facing serious renovation the monument 's designer , american architect peter eisenman , has not been back to the memorial since its opening in may 2005 , and was originally against the addition of the information center .
now , he is more pleased than ever with his work . " it 's unusual for an american to sit here and say , it was my intention to give you back your memory , " eisenman said .
" it sounds rather condescending , but i think if i had been german , i would have done it and perceived it in the same way . " it was n't an easy road for eisenman ; the memorial that was finally constructed was the second proposal , after the large-scale sculptor richard serra backed out of the project . " i 'm very proud of what we accomplished .
we encountered a great deal of disputes and setbacks .
but lea rosh kept us from giving up , and step by step we got there .
by now , those difficulties have faded into history .
now it 's about the present and the future . looking forward the monument 's future is not fully unproblematic .
recently , faulty construction has begun taking a toll on the concrete pillars , and renovation or partial reconstruction will soon become urgently necessary . uwe neumaerker , the director of the memorial foundation , told deutsche welle he does not know how long the process will take , adding that " tests have shown that unfortunately it will take a very long time . "
still , neumaerker assures that " nothing will fall apart . " more likely than the memorial 's concrete steles falling on visitors , it seems , is visitors falling off steles .
the monument has become a popular destination for games of hide-and-seek , parkour daredevils and sun-worshippers that come on warm days to enjoy the shade-free tops of the steles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial is sometimes used for other purposes rosh takes a relatively relaxed stance toward visitors repurposing her memorial . " sometimes i go and see people sunning themselves on the steles and tell them that there are lawns for sunbathing in the tiergarten just across the street , " she said .
" i tell the boys who are hopping around on the steles that they should do that somewhere else . " when i tell the eight- to 12-year-olds that they should go into the information center below the memorial and then come talk to me about it , it 's always very powerful .
they tell me they 've learned a lot . " author : marcel fuerstenau -lrb- dl -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw looks at the memorial 's past , present and future . in 1953 - in the wake of the holocaust - a first order of business for the young israeli state was the construction of the yad vashem memorial in jerusalem .
forty years later , washington , d.c. built its holocaust memorial .
yet it was n't until 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii , that germany , the atrocity 's perpetrator , unveiled its memorial to the murdered jews of europe . it 's been five years since the holocaust memorial opened at the center of berlin .
support and appreciation for the monument - which caused 13 years of heated debate and may now be disintegrating - is stronger than ever . a grassroots proposal the idea for the memorial first came at the beginning of 1989 through a citizens ' initiative in berlin , spearheaded by journalist and publicist lea rosh and historian eberhard jaeckel .
the group wanted to see a national memorial to the jews who perished in the holocaust built in berlin , which was the capital of east germany at the time . with the fall of the berlin wall a few months later and the excitement of germany 's reunification shortly thereafter , the idea was almost immediately placed on the backburner .
a few years later , in 1992 , chancellor helmut kohl 's government became proponents of the memorial 's construction and set aside space for it next to berlin 's brandenburg gate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architect peter eisenman says he could n't have done it without rosh 's support in bonn , still the capital of west germany , many parliamentarians fought for the monument to be built .
among them was christian democrat norbert lammert , who is now head of the memorial 's curatorial committee . lammert says that he and several others " emphatically advocated that the government 's move to berlin after reunification needed to begin with such a demonstrative sign . " but the monument itself would not be realized for quite some time .
after rounds of hearings , debates , competitions and exhibitions , the german parliament finally decided to create a foundation to decide on and implement a design for the memorial . throughout this process and the further debates that ensued , the memorial 's conceptualists , rosh and jaeckel , remained clear on what they wanted their brainchild to accomplish .

those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .
no-names were the stars bildunterschrift : klose had a lot of time for rest and reflection this season the mvp of the season was arjen robben , who brought a whole new level of class to the bundesliga , but otherwise this was not a good year for marquee players .
at bayern , van gaal decided he could largely live without luca toni , miroslav klose , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuck , whose services had cost bayern at least 66 million euros -lrb- $ 86 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .
they 'll be playing in the champions league next season .
cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .
comedies of errors bildunterschrift : burchert learned the hard way about the risks of coming out of goal 2009-10 will also be remembered as the year established clubs found new and innovative ways to lose .
no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .
in fact , sometimes german football resembled professional wrestling , with a variety of objects being enlisted to help individuals express their dissatisfaction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero 's aim , in this instance , was good in bochum , a security official was clobbered with a chair , as fans realized they , too , had been relegated .
and down in the second division , hansa rostock supporters hit their own goalkeeper with a tossed firecracker .
but one player fought back .
hamburg striker paolo guerrero beaned a supporter with a water bottle after some unappreciated criticism .
it was one of peruvian 's rare appearances - he missed 28 games due to injury , fear of flying and suspension .
" when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro , " wrote the late , great hunter s. thompson .
but 2009-10 was a year in which once the season got going , the pros turned weird .

those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .
no-names were the stars bildunterschrift : klose had a lot of time for rest and reflection this season the mvp of the season was arjen robben , who brought a whole new level of class to the bundesliga , but otherwise this was not a good year for marquee players .
at bayern , van gaal decided he could largely live without luca toni , miroslav klose , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuck , whose services had cost bayern at least 66 million euros -lrb- $ 86 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .
they 'll be playing in the champions league next season .
cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .
comedies of errors bildunterschrift : burchert learned the hard way about the risks of coming out of goal 2009-10 will also be remembered as the year established clubs found new and innovative ways to lose .
no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .
in fact , sometimes german football resembled professional wrestling , with a variety of objects being enlisted to help individuals express their dissatisfaction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero 's aim , in this instance , was good in bochum , a security official was clobbered with a chair , as fans realized they , too , had been relegated .
and down in the second division , hansa rostock supporters hit their own goalkeeper with a tossed firecracker .
but one player fought back .
hamburg striker paolo guerrero beaned a supporter with a water bottle after some unappreciated criticism .
it was one of peruvian 's rare appearances - he missed 28 games due to injury , fear of flying and suspension .
" when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro , " wrote the late , great hunter s. thompson .
but 2009-10 was a year in which once the season got going , the pros turned weird .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 10.05.2010 2009-10 bundesliga season may have set a new record for weirdness großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it took van gaal a while to get a grip on bayern mr. nice guy went on a newspaper tirade , own goals became an art form , and a lot of stuff got thrown at a lot of people .
those were just some of the curiosities that made this season unique . bayern munich may have hoisted the trophy in the end , but the start of the season was more about squabbling than celebrating .
in the first week of november , the bavarian giants were eighth in the table , and coach louis van gaal , now hailed as a genius , was regarded as an incomprehensible , vaguely unpleasant oddity one loss away from losing his job .
the prospect of another year without any silverware was too much for mild-mannered philipp lahm , who criticized everything from transfer politics to on-field tactics in an interview with a munich newspaper .
it 's rare to see bayern players publicly questioning the team .
that 's because management essentially controls everything they say .
and it was almost unthinkable that the source of such straight talk would be lahm , a player who used to call home after every match to ask about the welfare of his pet rabbits milky way und brownie .
bayern bosses were hopping mad , handing lahm a record fine and then basically following his advice .
van gaal got the team playing a modified version of total football , players who did n't fit the 4-3-3 system were benched or shipped out of town , and bayern cruised to a 22nd german title .
it 's unlikely bayern president uli hoeness ever admitted to lahm that he was right , but the diminutive defender deserved such an admission .
cuddly he may be , but lahm showed some serious cojones when most munich players were skittishly trying to hide in the next best hole .
no-names were the stars bildunterschrift : klose had a lot of time for rest and reflection this season the mvp of the season was arjen robben , who brought a whole new level of class to the bundesliga , but otherwise this was not a good year for marquee players .
at bayern , van gaal decided he could largely live without luca toni , miroslav klose , mario gomez and anatoliy tymoshchuck , whose services had cost bayern at least 66 million euros -lrb- $ 86 million -rrb- in transfer fees .
instead , he gave starting jobs to two homegrown teenagers : thomas mueller and holger badstuber , and ivica olic , a journeyman striker bayern picked up for free from hamburg in the off-season .
over at schalke , coach felix magath was still more radical in his promotion of unknowns .
even hardcore royal blues fans had to consult their programs to find out who joel matip -lrb- 18 years old -rrb- , christoph moritz -lrb- 20 -rrb- , lukas schmitz -lrb- 22 -rrb- and levan kenia -lrb- 19 -rrb- were .
they 'll be playing in the champions league next season .
cologne probably should have followed their example .
hopes were high on the rhine with the return of lukas podolski and the arrival of portugese star maniche in the summer .
but the two combined for only four goals this season , and cologne 's best stretch came when the not-so-dynamic duo were injured or otherwise unavailable .
kuranyi fever bildunterschrift : kuranyi , l . , took schalke back to europe , then took off for moscow prior to the season there was no player bundesliga fans enjoyed ridiculing more than kevin kuranyi .
maybe it was the silly facial hair or the lisp that often makes him sound thicker than two short planks , but the schalke and former german national striker could do no right .
but under magath 's tutelage , kuranyi unexpectedly morphed into a scoring machine .
suddenly , people everywhere were urging germany coach joachim loew to take kuranyi to the world cup in south africa .
it was a fairytale in the making , and a soap opera that went on for months , but loew spoiled the fun by telling kuranyi , in essence , to get stuffed .
the striker rewarded schalke fans on the last day of the season with an impromptu strip-tease - and rewarded himself hours later with a massively lucrative contract from russian side dinamo moscow .
comedies of errors bildunterschrift : burchert learned the hard way about the risks of coming out of goal 2009-10 will also be remembered as the year established clubs found new and innovative ways to lose .
no one was better at this than hertha berlin in round 8 .
having dropped six in a row , hertha had made a brave start under a new coach against then joint-table-toppers hamburg .
but their hopes of a turnaround were crushed when back-up keeper sascha burchert twice bravely came out of his area to head away balls , only to see hamburg fire them back into the net from the midfield line .
it was a metaphor for a season that saw hertha get relegated , making berlin the only major european capital without a first-division football team .
but the dada match of the season was hands down moenchengladbach versus hanover in round 16 .
hanover scored six goals in that encounter but lost 5-3 since three of their strikes went into their own net .
fullback karim haggui even chalked up a brace with a pair of blunders in what was probably one of the worst days ever for a professional defender .
foreign objects after hanover goalkeeper robert enke committed suicide , there were lots of calls for a kinder , gentler football culture , with more respect for the players as human beings .
but , perhaps predictably , the sermons were instantly forgotten once enke became yesterday 's news .
in fact , sometimes german football resembled professional wrestling , with a variety of objects being enlisted to help individuals express their dissatisfaction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guerrero 's aim , in this instance , was good in bochum , a security official was clobbered with a chair , as fans realized they , too , had been relegated .
and down in the second division , hansa rostock supporters hit their own goalkeeper with a tossed firecracker .
but one player fought back .
hamburg striker paolo guerrero beaned a supporter with a water bottle after some unappreciated criticism .
it was one of peruvian 's rare appearances - he missed 28 games due to injury , fear of flying and suspension .
" when the going gets weird , the weird turn pro , " wrote the late , great hunter s. thompson .
but 2009-10 was a year in which once the season got going , the pros turned weird .

the center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were only marginally behind , winning 34.5 percent of the vote . the business-friendly free democrats , the cdu 's current coalition partner in north rhine-westphalia and at the national level , gained half a percentage point , winning 6.7 percent of the vote .
the environmentalist greens did the best , almost doubling their showing from the last state election , securing 12.1 percent .
the left party won 5.6 percent , and is now poised to enter the nrw state parliament for the first time .
the election outcome means that the opposition social democrats and the green party could narrowly form a governing coalition in germany 's most populous state with a slim one-vote majority , but would likely require support from the left party . the alternatives are a coalition between the cdu and the greens , a grand coalition of spd and cdu , a so-called ' jamaica ' alliance between the cdu , greens and fdp , or a ' traffic light ' coalition between the spd , greens and fdp .
a failed test the nrw state election was the first litmus test for chancellor merkel 's six-month-old cdu-fdp government . the loss in north rhine-westphalia has cost her government its majority in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , which represents the 16 federal states .
the debacle in nrw will make it considerably harder for merkel to push through parliament key reforms and tax cuts needed to revitalize europe 's largest economy .
the election comes just days after the german bundestag approved a 22.4-billion-euro -lrb- $ 28.6 billion -rrb- emergency bailout for debt-stricken greece , a move that has proved deeply unpopular with voters .
" this is a bitter defeat for the cdu in the state and federally , " gerd langguth , political scientist at bonn university , told the reuters news agency . " it is also an object lesson for the performance of the federal government , especially for the fdp , " he added . " the greek aid package also had an effect .
people are n't happy about germany being europe 's paymaster , " he said . results that ca n't be ignored spd and green leaders took the election results as a sign of bigger changes to come in the country 's political landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kraft celebrates with other spd members " the spd is back ! "
social democrat candidate hannelore kraft told supporters as the first results came in . " an spd-green alliance is what north rhine-westphalia wants ! "
the co-chair of the greens , claudia roth , said the vote was the payback for the government 's decisions in berlin .
" for the federal cdu-fdp coalition , my friends , this is the beginning of the end , " she said .
a leading member of the cdu , wolfgang bosbach , also said the loss for the conservatives was a sign of bigger issues .

the site , near the kosovo border , was " more proof that serbia does not shy away from its dark past and is ready to bring to justice all those who have committed crimes , " said prosecutor vladimir vukcevic .
during the two-year conflict , serb forces controlled by former strongman slobodan milosevic transported the remains of hundreds of ethnic albanian civilians to several locations in serbia in a bid to cover up mass killings and war crimes .
in 2001 , the remains of more than 830 kosovo albanians were found at three sites in serbia .
over 700 bodies have since been uncovered in a mass grave located in a suburb of the capital , belgrade .
dozens more were found in the towns of petrovo selo and perucac .
the exhumation of bodies from the raska site is expected to begin soon when an evaluation of the crime scene is completed .
a former top police official and serbian deputy interior minister during the kosovo conflict , vlastimir djordjevic , is believed to have ordered the vast cover-up .
djordjevic is currently standing trial at the un war crimes tribunal in the hague. gb / reuters / afp editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the slick reaches us shores , bp wants you to come up with a solution . the 100-ton containment dome that bp hoped would stop an ongoing oil spill into the gulf of mexico , has failed after clogging with ice crystals .
the dome , which was lowered to the seafloor last thursday , was meant to funnel leaking crude into a rigger .
the oil has been shooting into the gulf at a rate of 5,000 barrels -lrb- 210,000 gallons -rrb- per day , since an april 20 explosion off the coast of louisiana that left 11 missing and presumably dead .
with no quick fix in sight now and the oil slick reaching shorelines , bp is calling on clever non-experts to come up with solutions .
one sure option bp is putting a brave face on their current dilemma , which is bringing them tens of millions of dollars in new lawsuits , and costing them six million dollars -lrb- 4.6 million euros -rrb- in cleanup each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp 's 100-ton containment dome filled with ice crystals instead of funneling oil " i would n't say it 's failed yet , " said doug suttles , bp 's chief operating officer , the day after ice crystals clogged the containment dome .
" what i would say is , what we attempted to do last night did n't work . "
bp is considering using a smaller containment dome that will be less prone to clogging .
admiral thad allen , head of the us coast guard , also told cbs television that a type of plug was also being considered .
" they 're actually going to take a bunch of debris – shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that – and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up and stop the leak . "
however , experts warn that if such a procedure failed , it could cause the flow of the oil to increase exponentially .
the only sure option , geologist lorenz schwark told deutsche welle , is to drill a relief well to intercept the original well and to fill it with very heavy cement that would block the oil 's flow .
this process was used once in the gulf of mexico in 1979 ; at the time taking 10 months .
this time , he estimates , it will take about three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with no quick fix in sight , bp is looking for clever ideas from the public hair-brained schemes ?
publically flummoxed – and threatened by a drastic loss of face – bp has launched the website www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com to collect creative ideas from the general public on how to solve the spill .
submissions are then forwarded to engineers .
bp spokesperson bryan ferguson told reporters in louisiana that he had " no idea " to what extent these suggestions were being worked on , but said that bp had " flown in experts from around the world to collaborate and contemplate the ideas that are presented . "
most of the ideas being presented are probably not feasible , unfortunately .
professor schwark at the university of kiel said that he has received a number of emails himself in recent days from individuals wanting to present him their own ideas .
" most of them were quite drastic , including planting a nuclear device on the seafloor and just blowing up the whole area , " he said .
" i was wondering whether people do consider the effects of such an event if carried out under water in the real world , and not just in a comic film . "
a local initiative some initiatives led by non-experts are already underway along the threatened gulf shoreline .
in walton county , florida , sheriff michael a. adkinson unveiled his plan to protect 42 kilometers of white , sandy beaches .
adkinson has hired a private contractor to float several barges loaded with 1,400 pound -lrb- 635 kilogram -rrb- bales of hay into the gulf , which will then be shredded and blown onto the surface of the water , where he believes it will absorb the oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already doing damage to marine life , the spill threatens shorelines as well as for the source of the problem , schwark said , if his three-month estimation for relief efforts is correct and the oil flow remains constant , the amount spilled will total around 40 thousand tons , equal to the amount of oil leaked during the alaskan exxon-valdez disaster in 1989 – the biggest in us history to date .
schwark added that , given the 80-kilometer -lrb- 50-mile -rrb- distance from the shoreline in this case , he did n't think the overall environmental impact would be as devastating as in alaska .
said mary landry of the us coast guard , " i do n't think any of us know at this time what the impact will be on the environment , or the economic issues that are associated with this spill . "

as the slick reaches us shores , bp wants you to come up with a solution . the 100-ton containment dome that bp hoped would stop an ongoing oil spill into the gulf of mexico , has failed after clogging with ice crystals .
the dome , which was lowered to the seafloor last thursday , was meant to funnel leaking crude into a rigger .
the oil has been shooting into the gulf at a rate of 5,000 barrels -lrb- 210,000 gallons -rrb- per day , since an april 20 explosion off the coast of louisiana that left 11 missing and presumably dead .
with no quick fix in sight now and the oil slick reaching shorelines , bp is calling on clever non-experts to come up with solutions .
one sure option bp is putting a brave face on their current dilemma , which is bringing them tens of millions of dollars in new lawsuits , and costing them six million dollars -lrb- 4.6 million euros -rrb- in cleanup each day .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp 's 100-ton containment dome filled with ice crystals instead of funneling oil " i would n't say it 's failed yet , " said doug suttles , bp 's chief operating officer , the day after ice crystals clogged the containment dome .
" what i would say is , what we attempted to do last night did n't work . "
bp is considering using a smaller containment dome that will be less prone to clogging .
admiral thad allen , head of the us coast guard , also told cbs television that a type of plug was also being considered .
" they 're actually going to take a bunch of debris – shredded up tires , golf balls and things like that – and under very high pressure shoot it into the preventer itself and see if they can clog it up and stop the leak . "
however , experts warn that if such a procedure failed , it could cause the flow of the oil to increase exponentially .
the only sure option , geologist lorenz schwark told deutsche welle , is to drill a relief well to intercept the original well and to fill it with very heavy cement that would block the oil 's flow .
this process was used once in the gulf of mexico in 1979 ; at the time taking 10 months .
this time , he estimates , it will take about three .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with no quick fix in sight , bp is looking for clever ideas from the public hair-brained schemes ?
publically flummoxed – and threatened by a drastic loss of face – bp has launched the website www.deepwaterhorizonresponse.com to collect creative ideas from the general public on how to solve the spill .
submissions are then forwarded to engineers .
bp spokesperson bryan ferguson told reporters in louisiana that he had " no idea " to what extent these suggestions were being worked on , but said that bp had " flown in experts from around the world to collaborate and contemplate the ideas that are presented . "
most of the ideas being presented are probably not feasible , unfortunately .
professor schwark at the university of kiel said that he has received a number of emails himself in recent days from individuals wanting to present him their own ideas .
" most of them were quite drastic , including planting a nuclear device on the seafloor and just blowing up the whole area , " he said .
" i was wondering whether people do consider the effects of such an event if carried out under water in the real world , and not just in a comic film . "
a local initiative some initiatives led by non-experts are already underway along the threatened gulf shoreline .
in walton county , florida , sheriff michael a. adkinson unveiled his plan to protect 42 kilometers of white , sandy beaches .
adkinson has hired a private contractor to float several barges loaded with 1,400 pound -lrb- 635 kilogram -rrb- bales of hay into the gulf , which will then be shredded and blown onto the surface of the water , where he believes it will absorb the oil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already doing damage to marine life , the spill threatens shorelines as well as for the source of the problem , schwark said , if his three-month estimation for relief efforts is correct and the oil flow remains constant , the amount spilled will total around 40 thousand tons , equal to the amount of oil leaked during the alaskan exxon-valdez disaster in 1989 – the biggest in us history to date .
schwark added that , given the 80-kilometer -lrb- 50-mile -rrb- distance from the shoreline in this case , he did n't think the overall environmental impact would be as devastating as in alaska .
said mary landry of the us coast guard , " i do n't think any of us know at this time what the impact will be on the environment , or the economic issues that are associated with this spill . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.05.2010 pigeon racing lives on in the european capital of culture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon sport costs a great deal of time and money most people consider pigeons a nuisance , but for some ruhr valley natives the birds are a way of life : a family activity , an obsession , even a profession .
once a hobby for miners , pigeon racing now attracts the wealthy . thousands of peeled eyes and pricked ears follow the coveted first lot as it 's brought to the auction block in dortmund 's expo center .
within a few minutes the bids reach 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,730 -rrb- , and then the item is " going once , going twice , going three times , sold . "
the crowd roars as the happy bidders step forward - to claim their new homing pigeon .
this hullabaloo is n't about quicker postal service .
the pigeon is for racing . twenty thousand pigeon fanciers visited dortmund 's annual homing pigeon fair and auction in the heart of the ruhr valley this year . although the former mining region is european capital of culture for 2010 , it is still richer in local color than high art .
case in point : the region is and remains germany 's pigeon-racing stronghold . pigeon sport is changing though , like the ruhr area itself . a whole new game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon-racing youth groups promote the sport in his half century of pigeon racing , dietmar schulz has seen the sport change considerably .
the 66-year-old retired locksmith from bochum remembers the days when 30 pigeon fanciers lived on his street .
now there are only three .
back then , in the summertime , the weekly release and return of the pigeons was the primary source of entertainment and bonding . " in the 40s , 50s and 60s , there were soccer clubs , pigeon clubs and rabbit clubs , " he recounted .
" that was it . " at the time of germany 's reunification in 1990 , well after pigeon racing 's heyday , there were still around 80,000 breeders in west germany alone .
today the german association of homing pigeon breeders estimates around 60,000 in all of germany . even so , the competition has become a good deal fiercer . dietmar schulz and his wife heike no longer bring home the big prizes .
they can not keep up with today 's wealthy breeders , some of whom can afford to buy single pigeons for the price of small houses and hire drivers to cart their birds hundreds of kilometers each day for training flights . the doctor is in with so much focus on success , it 's hard to tell what pigeon breeders love more : their pigeons or winning .
as head veterinarian at the pigeon clinic in essen - part of the extensive and evermore specialized homing-pigeon infrastructure - ludger kamphausen says the breeder-bird relationship plays a big role in his work . " there are those who see the pigeons as pets that they love , and others who are just interested in the birds ' performance , and who calculate every veterinary procedure as a financial investment , " he said . during the summer racing season , the clinic sees thousands of pigeons each day , as breeders try to figure out why their birds are n't winning .
in view of the amount of money invested in the hobby , it 's not surprising that the state-of-the-art clinic offers the kind of medical care unavailable to most humans . kamphausen 's colleague , elisabeth peus , has a simple explanation for why her costly veterinary services are in such demand . " the joy that breeders feel when their pigeons come home is what they invest so much in , " she says .
" i personally do n't have pigeons , because i 'd be too scared that they would n't come home ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money is no object for some pigeon racers the next generation christian nuesser does n't share dr. peus ' fear .
a fourth-generation pigeon racer from linnich , near the dutch border , nuesser is one of the few young people active in the sport .
at 16 , he spends two hours every weekday caring for his birds , and five hours a day on weekends .
" my dream , " he said , " is to get a few good pigeons which fly very quick and to be on the top of the charts . "
nuesser does n't know any pigeon breeders his own age .
what puts off other kids , he thinks , is the large time investment that 's necessary . indeed , attracting youth is the biggest challenge facing pigeon racing today , according to 23-year-old ruben hermans , president of the west european youth commission for pigeon sport . " it takes a few years to win prizes , and many young people do n't have the patience , " he said . yet there is a youth pigeon-racing scene , even if small .
hermans came to the fair in dortmund with several of his pigeon-buddies and had a hand in the youth section of the fair , which included games and even a young people 's pigeon auction . " the best pigeon experience is to make a lot of social contact with other people , " hermans said , " in pigeon sport there are lots of friends - also older people , also people from all over the world . " a complex love ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon breeding is usually a family activity back in bochum , the schulz family are trying their luck with a new flock .
their last flock of birds all ended in the saucepan - the fate of many racing pigeons who do n't make the grade . mr. schulz has high expectations of his birds ' performance but says that his love of pigeons and his desire to win are one and the same .
mrs. schulz , however , says that in the end it 's not just about winning . " when you have a stressful day or you 're depressed , you can come in here and sit down , " she said .
" the pigeons come to you and you can cuddle with them .
it makes you feel good . " while some of the sport 's newer , wealthier participants may come and go , the old guard is in the game for good .
prizes or no prizes , the schulzes say they will be raising and racing pigeons for as long as they 're still standing . author : david levitz editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

once a hobby for miners , pigeon racing now attracts the wealthy . thousands of peeled eyes and pricked ears follow the coveted first lot as it 's brought to the auction block in dortmund 's expo center .
within a few minutes the bids reach 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,730 -rrb- , and then the item is " going once , going twice , going three times , sold . "
the crowd roars as the happy bidders step forward - to claim their new homing pigeon .
this hullabaloo is n't about quicker postal service .
the pigeon is for racing . twenty thousand pigeon fanciers visited dortmund 's annual homing pigeon fair and auction in the heart of the ruhr valley this year . although the former mining region is european capital of culture for 2010 , it is still richer in local color than high art .
case in point : the region is and remains germany 's pigeon-racing stronghold . pigeon sport is changing though , like the ruhr area itself . a whole new game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon-racing youth groups promote the sport in his half century of pigeon racing , dietmar schulz has seen the sport change considerably .
the 66-year-old retired locksmith from bochum remembers the days when 30 pigeon fanciers lived on his street .
now there are only three .
back then , in the summertime , the weekly release and return of the pigeons was the primary source of entertainment and bonding . " in the 40s , 50s and 60s , there were soccer clubs , pigeon clubs and rabbit clubs , " he recounted .
" that was it . " at the time of germany 's reunification in 1990 , well after pigeon racing 's heyday , there were still around 80,000 breeders in west germany alone .
today the german association of homing pigeon breeders estimates around 60,000 in all of germany . even so , the competition has become a good deal fiercer . dietmar schulz and his wife heike no longer bring home the big prizes .
they can not keep up with today 's wealthy breeders , some of whom can afford to buy single pigeons for the price of small houses and hire drivers to cart their birds hundreds of kilometers each day for training flights . the doctor is in with so much focus on success , it 's hard to tell what pigeon breeders love more : their pigeons or winning .
as head veterinarian at the pigeon clinic in essen - part of the extensive and evermore specialized homing-pigeon infrastructure - ludger kamphausen says the breeder-bird relationship plays a big role in his work . " there are those who see the pigeons as pets that they love , and others who are just interested in the birds ' performance , and who calculate every veterinary procedure as a financial investment , " he said . during the summer racing season , the clinic sees thousands of pigeons each day , as breeders try to figure out why their birds are n't winning .
in view of the amount of money invested in the hobby , it 's not surprising that the state-of-the-art clinic offers the kind of medical care unavailable to most humans . kamphausen 's colleague , elisabeth peus , has a simple explanation for why her costly veterinary services are in such demand . " the joy that breeders feel when their pigeons come home is what they invest so much in , " she says .
" i personally do n't have pigeons , because i 'd be too scared that they would n't come home ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money is no object for some pigeon racers the next generation christian nuesser does n't share dr. peus ' fear .
a fourth-generation pigeon racer from linnich , near the dutch border , nuesser is one of the few young people active in the sport .
at 16 , he spends two hours every weekday caring for his birds , and five hours a day on weekends .
" my dream , " he said , " is to get a few good pigeons which fly very quick and to be on the top of the charts . "
nuesser does n't know any pigeon breeders his own age .
what puts off other kids , he thinks , is the large time investment that 's necessary . indeed , attracting youth is the biggest challenge facing pigeon racing today , according to 23-year-old ruben hermans , president of the west european youth commission for pigeon sport . " it takes a few years to win prizes , and many young people do n't have the patience , " he said . yet there is a youth pigeon-racing scene , even if small .
hermans came to the fair in dortmund with several of his pigeon-buddies and had a hand in the youth section of the fair , which included games and even a young people 's pigeon auction . " the best pigeon experience is to make a lot of social contact with other people , " hermans said , " in pigeon sport there are lots of friends - also older people , also people from all over the world .

once a hobby for miners , pigeon racing now attracts the wealthy . thousands of peeled eyes and pricked ears follow the coveted first lot as it 's brought to the auction block in dortmund 's expo center .
within a few minutes the bids reach 6,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,730 -rrb- , and then the item is " going once , going twice , going three times , sold . "
the crowd roars as the happy bidders step forward - to claim their new homing pigeon .
this hullabaloo is n't about quicker postal service .
the pigeon is for racing . twenty thousand pigeon fanciers visited dortmund 's annual homing pigeon fair and auction in the heart of the ruhr valley this year . although the former mining region is european capital of culture for 2010 , it is still richer in local color than high art .
case in point : the region is and remains germany 's pigeon-racing stronghold . pigeon sport is changing though , like the ruhr area itself . a whole new game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon-racing youth groups promote the sport in his half century of pigeon racing , dietmar schulz has seen the sport change considerably .
the 66-year-old retired locksmith from bochum remembers the days when 30 pigeon fanciers lived on his street .
now there are only three .
back then , in the summertime , the weekly release and return of the pigeons was the primary source of entertainment and bonding . " in the 40s , 50s and 60s , there were soccer clubs , pigeon clubs and rabbit clubs , " he recounted .
" that was it . " at the time of germany 's reunification in 1990 , well after pigeon racing 's heyday , there were still around 80,000 breeders in west germany alone .
today the german association of homing pigeon breeders estimates around 60,000 in all of germany . even so , the competition has become a good deal fiercer . dietmar schulz and his wife heike no longer bring home the big prizes .
they can not keep up with today 's wealthy breeders , some of whom can afford to buy single pigeons for the price of small houses and hire drivers to cart their birds hundreds of kilometers each day for training flights . the doctor is in with so much focus on success , it 's hard to tell what pigeon breeders love more : their pigeons or winning .
as head veterinarian at the pigeon clinic in essen - part of the extensive and evermore specialized homing-pigeon infrastructure - ludger kamphausen says the breeder-bird relationship plays a big role in his work . " there are those who see the pigeons as pets that they love , and others who are just interested in the birds ' performance , and who calculate every veterinary procedure as a financial investment , " he said . during the summer racing season , the clinic sees thousands of pigeons each day , as breeders try to figure out why their birds are n't winning .
in view of the amount of money invested in the hobby , it 's not surprising that the state-of-the-art clinic offers the kind of medical care unavailable to most humans . kamphausen 's colleague , elisabeth peus , has a simple explanation for why her costly veterinary services are in such demand . " the joy that breeders feel when their pigeons come home is what they invest so much in , " she says .
" i personally do n't have pigeons , because i 'd be too scared that they would n't come home ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : money is no object for some pigeon racers the next generation christian nuesser does n't share dr. peus ' fear .
a fourth-generation pigeon racer from linnich , near the dutch border , nuesser is one of the few young people active in the sport .
at 16 , he spends two hours every weekday caring for his birds , and five hours a day on weekends .
" my dream , " he said , " is to get a few good pigeons which fly very quick and to be on the top of the charts . "
nuesser does n't know any pigeon breeders his own age .
what puts off other kids , he thinks , is the large time investment that 's necessary . indeed , attracting youth is the biggest challenge facing pigeon racing today , according to 23-year-old ruben hermans , president of the west european youth commission for pigeon sport . " it takes a few years to win prizes , and many young people do n't have the patience , " he said . yet there is a youth pigeon-racing scene , even if small .
hermans came to the fair in dortmund with several of his pigeon-buddies and had a hand in the youth section of the fair , which included games and even a young people 's pigeon auction . " the best pigeon experience is to make a lot of social contact with other people , " hermans said , " in pigeon sport there are lots of friends - also older people , also people from all over the world . " a complex love ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pigeon breeding is usually a family activity back in bochum , the schulz family are trying their luck with a new flock .
their last flock of birds all ended in the saucepan - the fate of many racing pigeons who do n't make the grade . mr. schulz has high expectations of his birds ' performance but says that his love of pigeons and his desire to win are one and the same .
mrs. schulz , however , says that in the end it 's not just about winning . " when you have a stressful day or you 're depressed , you can come in here and sit down , " she said .
" the pigeons come to you and you can cuddle with them .
it makes you feel good . " while some of the sport 's newer , wealthier participants may come and go , the old guard is in the game for good .
prizes or no prizes , the schulzes say they will be raising and racing pigeons for as long as they 're still standing . author : david levitz editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
