bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is looking to gain support from her former coalition partner , the spd the chancellor is said to have already met with social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
local media reports say the two party leaders agreed to avoid any party bickering over the afghan mission .
since last year , steinmeier 's spd boosted criticism over the mission .
the fact that merkel is attempting to foster bipartisan support on this issue reduces the chances that germany will be increasing its military presence in afghanistan - despite being under pressure to join us president barack obama 's troop surge in the country .
the spd is opposed to sending more troops to the region .
instead , it would prefer to strengthen afghan security forces through education and training .
exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants to focus on training afghan security forces the spd has also made it clear that it wants to know exactly when german troops will be withdrawn from afghanistan .
spd chief sigmar gabriel said in recent weeks that the german military must begin withdrawals by 2011 .
" in the year that the united states begins to reduce its troop levels , that means germany must also start withdrawing in 2011 , " said gabriel in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" until then , germany has to train afghan police officers and soldiers much more quickly than before . "
under german law , foreign military deployments are only allowed after parliamentary approval for fixed periods .
guttenberg told bild that the widest parliamentary agreement on afghanistan " is important to ensure our soldiers have backing . "
rough deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz airstrike was a huge blow to german public opinion over the mission currently , germany has close to 4,400 troops stationed in northern afghanistan .
in recent months , the country 's deployment faced immense controversy over a german-ordered airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers in the city of kunduz in september , when up to 142 civilians are believed to have been killed .
the causalities made the already unpopular war even more unpopular among german citizens , and forced the defense minister at the time , franz josef jung , to resign .
meanwhile , german troops killed an afghan civilian on sunday , when two men approached a german checkpoint in a car at high speed .
the soldiers fired when the vehicle showed no signs of slowing down .
the german government is expected to wait until the end of january with its decision over troop activities and levels in afghanistan .

the german publisher associations have previously complained that google profits from their online content without offering them a fair share of advertising revenue .
although details as to the exact nature of the complaint have not yet been released , the main concern is believed to revolve around " snippets " from media websites and news articles which show up in search results on google news . publishers say google has not paid for the use of these articles , and that regulations must be tightened to protect the authors from plagiarism .
the associations also say the way search results are currently listed is unfair .
in november , a bdzv official said his group wanted to know why some google news results were ranked higher than others .
google facing three complaints the vdz and bdzv 's concerns about google 's business practices are shared by shopping site , ciao , and map company , euro-cities .
ciao 's complaint is related to a contract about google 's automatic advertising system , adsense , which ciao signed before it was bought by microsoft .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- reported that ciao believes the contract to be overly restrictive , while not offering enough transparency on advertising revenues generated by adsense .
bildunterschrift : euro-cities says its business model is threatened by google maps euro-cities is unhappy with the fact that maps from google maps are being integrated on other internet sites for free , saying the practice is destroying its business model , the faz reported .
none of the complainants have officially commented on the issue .
euro-cities chief executive hans biermann said the parties agreed with the cartel office not to make the case fully public until january 20 .
google denies wrongdoing google 's german spokesman kay oberbeck says the company is confident it has done nothing wrong .
" we are very willing to explain our products and business practices to the cartel office and show that we are convinced these are in line with german and european law , " oberbeck said .
oberbeck added the company paid 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to publishers worldwide in 2009 .
in germany alone , google earns close to 1.2 billion euros a year on ads placed next to regular search results. mk / dc / dpa / apn editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is looking to gain support from her former coalition partner , the spd the chancellor is said to have already met with social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
local media reports say the two party leaders agreed to avoid any party bickering over the afghan mission .
since last year , steinmeier 's spd boosted criticism over the mission .
the fact that merkel is attempting to foster bipartisan support on this issue reduces the chances that germany will be increasing its military presence in afghanistan - despite being under pressure to join us president barack obama 's troop surge in the country .
the spd is opposed to sending more troops to the region .
instead , it would prefer to strengthen afghan security forces through education and training .
exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants to focus on training afghan security forces the spd has also made it clear that it wants to know exactly when german troops will be withdrawn from afghanistan .
spd chief sigmar gabriel said in recent weeks that the german military must begin withdrawals by 2011 .
" in the year that the united states begins to reduce its troop levels , that means germany must also start withdrawing in 2011 , " said gabriel in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" until then , germany has to train afghan police officers and soldiers much more quickly than before . "
under german law , foreign military deployments are only allowed after parliamentary approval for fixed periods .
guttenberg told bild that the widest parliamentary agreement on afghanistan " is important to ensure our soldiers have backing . "
rough deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz airstrike was a huge blow to german public opinion over the mission currently , germany has close to 4,400 troops stationed in northern afghanistan .
in recent months , the country 's deployment faced immense controversy over a german-ordered airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers in the city of kunduz in september , when up to 142 civilians are believed to have been killed .
the causalities made the already unpopular war even more unpopular among german citizens , and forced the defense minister at the time , franz josef jung , to resign .
meanwhile , german troops killed an afghan civilian on sunday , when two men approached a german checkpoint in a car at high speed .
the soldiers fired when the vehicle showed no signs of slowing down .

the eu is increasingly worried about greece 's financial troubles affecting the stability of the euro currency .
next week , brussels is to vet athens ' crisis plan put forward to solve the country 's serious fiscal problems . greece is under mounting pressure from the eu to take drastic action to restore its public finances .
the country 's public spending deficit rose to 12.7 percent last year - far above the three percent permitted by the eurozone countries . the government in athens on thursday presented a crisis plan to get public spending back under control .
the three-year blueprint aims at bringing the public deficit to 8.7 percent in 2010 and eventually down to 2.8 percent by 2012 . the plan was submitted to eu on friday and next week will be examined by the eu commission . on monday , the eurozone 's economy ministers will meet while on thursday a meeting of all 27 eu economy ministers is scheduled . strong criticism from berlin the fiasco of greek 's public finances is putting a severe strain on the eurozone and has sparked a debate on whether athens could even be forced to abandon the single currency . german chancellor angela merkel broke from standard discourse this week when she pointed out her grave concerns over athens ' financial troubles . " the greece example is putting us under great , great pressure , " she said .
" the euro is in a very difficult phase for the coming years . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel was unusually frank in her comments about greece merkel subsequently was quick to say she did n't mean any direct criticism , but her somber tone expressed a concern shared by many of her colleagues across europe . there are worries that athens ' fiscal problems could threaten the credibility of the eurozone and could be a precursor to similar debt crises in weaker european economies . greece 's credit rating has been downgraded by all major international rating agencies and financial analysts have cast doubt on whether athens will be able to implement its rigorous austerity plan .
the country 's powerful unions have already announced strikes to protest the measures . no special assistance luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker warned that " it would be false to let greece believe the other eurozone countries will help it resolve its problems . " in a similar vein , european central bank head jean-claude trichet told athens that help from the eu would be very limited . " no government , no state can expect from us any special treatment .
the problem is not to get help , the problem is to help oneself , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek pm papandreou was elected last october and inherited a huge budget deficit trichet , however dismissed the notion that greece could be forced out from the eurozone because of its debt crisis .
he described suggestions that athens might resign or be expelled as an " absurd hypothesis . " the european commission is expected to give its verdict on the greek crisis plan by late january and will then forward it to the bloc 's economy commissioner , who will have to give the final approval . the greek plan promises to cut welfare spending , reform taxation , battle tax evasion and save on public sector wages . " we will achieve fiscal consolidation within three years , we will do everything it takes for this , " greek prime minister george papandreou said , expressing his confidence when presenting the plan to parliament .
" we can do it , this target is feasible . " ai / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german publisher associations have previously complained that google profits from their online content without offering them a fair share of advertising revenue .
although details as to the exact nature of the complaint have not yet been released , the main concern is believed to revolve around " snippets " from media websites and news articles which show up in search results on google news . publishers say google has not paid for the use of these articles , and that regulations must be tightened to protect the authors from plagiarism .
the associations also say the way search results are currently listed is unfair .
in november , a bdzv official said his group wanted to know why some google news results were ranked higher than others .
google facing three complaints the vdz and bdzv 's concerns about google 's business practices are shared by shopping site , ciao , and map company , euro-cities .
ciao 's complaint is related to a contract about google 's automatic advertising system , adsense , which ciao signed before it was bought by microsoft .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- reported that ciao believes the contract to be overly restrictive , while not offering enough transparency on advertising revenues generated by adsense .
bildunterschrift : euro-cities says its business model is threatened by google maps euro-cities is unhappy with the fact that maps from google maps are being integrated on other internet sites for free , saying the practice is destroying its business model , the faz reported .
none of the complainants have officially commented on the issue .
euro-cities chief executive hans biermann said the parties agreed with the cartel office not to make the case fully public until january 20 .
google denies wrongdoing google 's german spokesman kay oberbeck says the company is confident it has done nothing wrong .
" we are very willing to explain our products and business practices to the cartel office and show that we are convinced these are in line with german and european law , " oberbeck said .
oberbeck added the company paid 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to publishers worldwide in 2009 .
in germany alone , google earns close to 1.2 billion euros a year on ads placed next to regular search results. mk / dc / dpa / apn editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu is increasingly worried about greece 's financial troubles affecting the stability of the euro currency .
next week , brussels is to vet athens ' crisis plan put forward to solve the country 's serious fiscal problems . greece is under mounting pressure from the eu to take drastic action to restore its public finances .
the country 's public spending deficit rose to 12.7 percent last year - far above the three percent permitted by the eurozone countries . the government in athens on thursday presented a crisis plan to get public spending back under control .
the three-year blueprint aims at bringing the public deficit to 8.7 percent in 2010 and eventually down to 2.8 percent by 2012 . the plan was submitted to eu on friday and next week will be examined by the eu commission . on monday , the eurozone 's economy ministers will meet while on thursday a meeting of all 27 eu economy ministers is scheduled . strong criticism from berlin the fiasco of greek 's public finances is putting a severe strain on the eurozone and has sparked a debate on whether athens could even be forced to abandon the single currency . german chancellor angela merkel broke from standard discourse this week when she pointed out her grave concerns over athens ' financial troubles . " the greece example is putting us under great , great pressure , " she said .
" the euro is in a very difficult phase for the coming years . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel was unusually frank in her comments about greece merkel subsequently was quick to say she did n't mean any direct criticism , but her somber tone expressed a concern shared by many of her colleagues across europe . there are worries that athens ' fiscal problems could threaten the credibility of the eurozone and could be a precursor to similar debt crises in weaker european economies . greece 's credit rating has been downgraded by all major international rating agencies and financial analysts have cast doubt on whether athens will be able to implement its rigorous austerity plan .
the country 's powerful unions have already announced strikes to protest the measures . no special assistance luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker warned that " it would be false to let greece believe the other eurozone countries will help it resolve its problems . " in a similar vein , european central bank head jean-claude trichet told athens that help from the eu would be very limited . " no government , no state can expect from us any special treatment .
the problem is not to get help , the problem is to help oneself , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek pm papandreou was elected last october and inherited a huge budget deficit trichet , however dismissed the notion that greece could be forced out from the eurozone because of its debt crisis .
he described suggestions that athens might resign or be expelled as an " absurd hypothesis . " the european commission is expected to give its verdict on the greek crisis plan by late january and will then forward it to the bloc 's economy commissioner , who will have to give the final approval . the greek plan promises to cut welfare spending , reform taxation , battle tax evasion and save on public sector wages . " we will achieve fiscal consolidation within three years , we will do everything it takes for this , " greek prime minister george papandreou said , expressing his confidence when presenting the plan to parliament .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is looking to gain support from her former coalition partner , the spd the chancellor is said to have already met with social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
local media reports say the two party leaders agreed to avoid any party bickering over the afghan mission .
since last year , steinmeier 's spd boosted criticism over the mission .
the fact that merkel is attempting to foster bipartisan support on this issue reduces the chances that germany will be increasing its military presence in afghanistan - despite being under pressure to join us president barack obama 's troop surge in the country .
the spd is opposed to sending more troops to the region .
instead , it would prefer to strengthen afghan security forces through education and training .
exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants to focus on training afghan security forces the spd has also made it clear that it wants to know exactly when german troops will be withdrawn from afghanistan .
spd chief sigmar gabriel said in recent weeks that the german military must begin withdrawals by 2011 .
" in the year that the united states begins to reduce its troop levels , that means germany must also start withdrawing in 2011 , " said gabriel in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" until then , germany has to train afghan police officers and soldiers much more quickly than before . "
under german law , foreign military deployments are only allowed after parliamentary approval for fixed periods .
guttenberg told bild that the widest parliamentary agreement on afghanistan " is important to ensure our soldiers have backing . "
rough deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz airstrike was a huge blow to german public opinion over the mission currently , germany has close to 4,400 troops stationed in northern afghanistan .
in recent months , the country 's deployment faced immense controversy over a german-ordered airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers in the city of kunduz in september , when up to 142 civilians are believed to have been killed .
the causalities made the already unpopular war even more unpopular among german citizens , and forced the defense minister at the time , franz josef jung , to resign .
meanwhile , german troops killed an afghan civilian on sunday , when two men approached a german checkpoint in a car at high speed .
the soldiers fired when the vehicle showed no signs of slowing down .
the german government is expected to wait until the end of january with its decision over troop activities and levels in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 17.01.2010 germany seeks bipartisan backing for afghan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that germany will increase its military contingent in afghanistan chancellor angela merkel is looking to cross party lines and consult with the opposition social democrats in order to secure the broadest parliamentary support for the german military 's unpopular mission to afghanistan . in an interview published on sunday , january 17 , with daily bild , german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said merkel 's government will be pushing for bipartisan support to continue german troop deployments in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is looking to gain support from her former coalition partner , the spd the chancellor is said to have already met with social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
local media reports say the two party leaders agreed to avoid any party bickering over the afghan mission .
since last year , steinmeier 's spd boosted criticism over the mission .
the fact that merkel is attempting to foster bipartisan support on this issue reduces the chances that germany will be increasing its military presence in afghanistan - despite being under pressure to join us president barack obama 's troop surge in the country .
the spd is opposed to sending more troops to the region .
instead , it would prefer to strengthen afghan security forces through education and training .
exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants to focus on training afghan security forces the spd has also made it clear that it wants to know exactly when german troops will be withdrawn from afghanistan .
spd chief sigmar gabriel said in recent weeks that the german military must begin withdrawals by 2011 .
" in the year that the united states begins to reduce its troop levels , that means germany must also start withdrawing in 2011 , " said gabriel in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" until then , germany has to train afghan police officers and soldiers much more quickly than before . "
under german law , foreign military deployments are only allowed after parliamentary approval for fixed periods .
guttenberg told bild that the widest parliamentary agreement on afghanistan " is important to ensure our soldiers have backing . "
rough deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz airstrike was a huge blow to german public opinion over the mission currently , germany has close to 4,400 troops stationed in northern afghanistan .
in recent months , the country 's deployment faced immense controversy over a german-ordered airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers in the city of kunduz in september , when up to 142 civilians are believed to have been killed .
the causalities made the already unpopular war even more unpopular among german citizens , and forced the defense minister at the time , franz josef jung , to resign .

the german publisher associations have previously complained that google profits from their online content without offering them a fair share of advertising revenue .
although details as to the exact nature of the complaint have not yet been released , the main concern is believed to revolve around " snippets " from media websites and news articles which show up in search results on google news . publishers say google has not paid for the use of these articles , and that regulations must be tightened to protect the authors from plagiarism .
the associations also say the way search results are currently listed is unfair .
in november , a bdzv official said his group wanted to know why some google news results were ranked higher than others .
google facing three complaints the vdz and bdzv 's concerns about google 's business practices are shared by shopping site , ciao , and map company , euro-cities .
ciao 's complaint is related to a contract about google 's automatic advertising system , adsense , which ciao signed before it was bought by microsoft .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- reported that ciao believes the contract to be overly restrictive , while not offering enough transparency on advertising revenues generated by adsense .
bildunterschrift : euro-cities says its business model is threatened by google maps euro-cities is unhappy with the fact that maps from google maps are being integrated on other internet sites for free , saying the practice is destroying its business model , the faz reported .
none of the complainants have officially commented on the issue .
euro-cities chief executive hans biermann said the parties agreed with the cartel office not to make the case fully public until january 20 .
google denies wrongdoing google 's german spokesman kay oberbeck says the company is confident it has done nothing wrong .
" we are very willing to explain our products and business practices to the cartel office and show that we are convinced these are in line with german and european law , " oberbeck said .
oberbeck added the company paid 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to publishers worldwide in 2009 .
in germany alone , google earns close to 1.2 billion euros a year on ads placed next to regular search results. mk / dc / dpa / apn editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the silence of pius xii before the shoah , still hurts because something should have been done , " said the president of rome 's jewish community , riccardo pacifici .
" maybe it would not have stopped the death trains , but it would have sent a signal , a word of extreme comfort , of human solidarity , towards those brothers of ours transported to the ovens of auschwitz , " he said .
pacifici urged the vatican to open its archives and give historians access to documents which would shed light on the actions of the wartime pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope hopes his visit would ease the tensions between catholics and jews benedict xvi , however , defended the vatican 's position that the church was acting behind the scenes to help jews .
" the apostolic see itself provided assistance , often in a hidden and discreet way , " the pope said in his speech at the synagogue .
as he started his landmark visit to rome 's main synagogue on sunday , january 17 , benedict xvi paid homage to more than 1,000 roman jews deported to nazi death camps .
the catholic leader previously said his visit would open a " new phase along the irrevocable path of agreement and friendship " between catholics and jews .
rome 's chief rabbi riccardo di segni said the move was a sign that the catholic church wanted to " continue the dialogue . "
jewish community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii is accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi persecution of jews but the visit came only four weeks after the german-born pontiff found himself at the center of a controversy that served rather to divide than bring together .
in december 2009 , a papal decree bestowed the title " venerable " on world war two-era pius xii , thus putting him one step closer to sainthood .
the decision had resulted in an outcry by critics and jewish communities around the world who accuse pius xii of having failed to speak out against the holocaust .
pius xii 's papacy ran from 1939 until 1958 .
ahead of the visit to the synagogue , the president of italy 's assembly of rabbis , giuseppe laras , announced he would not attend the event and criticised benedict for weakening the ties between the two religions .
laras said the pope failed to show an " understanding of the feelings of the jewish community . "
another controversial move by pope benedict xvi was the decision to speed rapprochement with a catholic fraternity that includes holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson .
benedict xvi is the second modern pope to visit the rome synagogue .
his predecessor john paul ii first visited the place of worship in 1986 and at the time had been warmly welcomed for his efforts to mend tensions between the two religions .
failed assassin to be released meanwhile , the man who tried to kill john paul ii in 1981 will be released on monday from prison after spending almost three decades behind bars in italy and turkey .
mehmet ali agca said he wants to travel to the vatican to visit the tomb of john paul ii and to meet with the current pontiff .
agca has announced he will sell the rights to his story so that it can be turned into a book and movie . he was a 23-year-old member of a militant far-right group when on may 13 , 1981 he opened fire on john paul ii in st. peter 's square in rome , seriously wounding the pope. ai / afp / ep editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the silence of pius xii before the shoah , still hurts because something should have been done , " said the president of rome 's jewish community , riccardo pacifici .
" maybe it would not have stopped the death trains , but it would have sent a signal , a word of extreme comfort , of human solidarity , towards those brothers of ours transported to the ovens of auschwitz , " he said .
pacifici urged the vatican to open its archives and give historians access to documents which would shed light on the actions of the wartime pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope hopes his visit would ease the tensions between catholics and jews benedict xvi , however , defended the vatican 's position that the church was acting behind the scenes to help jews .
" the apostolic see itself provided assistance , often in a hidden and discreet way , " the pope said in his speech at the synagogue .
as he started his landmark visit to rome 's main synagogue on sunday , january 17 , benedict xvi paid homage to more than 1,000 roman jews deported to nazi death camps .
the catholic leader previously said his visit would open a " new phase along the irrevocable path of agreement and friendship " between catholics and jews .
rome 's chief rabbi riccardo di segni said the move was a sign that the catholic church wanted to " continue the dialogue . "
jewish community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii is accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi persecution of jews but the visit came only four weeks after the german-born pontiff found himself at the center of a controversy that served rather to divide than bring together .
in december 2009 , a papal decree bestowed the title " venerable " on world war two-era pius xii , thus putting him one step closer to sainthood .
the decision had resulted in an outcry by critics and jewish communities around the world who accuse pius xii of having failed to speak out against the holocaust .
pius xii 's papacy ran from 1939 until 1958 .
ahead of the visit to the synagogue , the president of italy 's assembly of rabbis , giuseppe laras , announced he would not attend the event and criticised benedict for weakening the ties between the two religions .
laras said the pope failed to show an " understanding of the feelings of the jewish community . "
another controversial move by pope benedict xvi was the decision to speed rapprochement with a catholic fraternity that includes holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson .
benedict xvi is the second modern pope to visit the rome synagogue .
his predecessor john paul ii first visited the place of worship in 1986 and at the time had been warmly welcomed for his efforts to mend tensions between the two religions .
failed assassin to be released meanwhile , the man who tried to kill john paul ii in 1981 will be released on monday from prison after spending almost three decades behind bars in italy and turkey .
mehmet ali agca said he wants to travel to the vatican to visit the tomb of john paul ii and to meet with the current pontiff .
agca has announced he will sell the rights to his story so that it can be turned into a book and movie . he was a 23-year-old member of a militant far-right group when on may 13 , 1981 he opened fire on john paul ii in st. peter 's square in rome , seriously wounding the pope. ai / afp / ep editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the haitian government says up to 200,000 people may have died . with aid agencies struggling to deliver relief supplies , us secretary of state hillary clinton has promised long-term assistance to the caribbean nation .
after an hour-long meeting with haiti 's president rene preval in port-au-prince , clinton told journalists : " as president barack obama has said , we will be here today , tomorrow and for the time ahead . "
clinton arrived in port-au-prince on saturday evening after travelling to the devastated capital aboard a us coast guard plane .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haiti 's president rene preval and us secretary of state hillary clinton in port-au-prince " i know the resilience and strength of the haitian people .
you have been severely tested , " clinton said .
" but i believe that haiti can come back stronger and better in the future . "
the us relief operation has been officially dubbed " operation unified response , " general douglas fraser , head of the us southern command , said on the command 's official page on twitter .
clinton emphasized that that the u.s. relief operation – involving thousands of soldiers , sailors and marines along with civilian aid workers - was done at the invitation of haiti 's government .
flanked by former presidents bill clinton and george w. bush , us president barack obama on saturday issued a united appeal for haiti 's quake victims .
sporadic fighting by armed gangs and reports of widespread looting have hampered rescue efforts .
a strong aftershock measuring 4.5 on the richter scale also temporarily halted aid operations as desperate survivors struggled to find food and water .
bildunterschrift : a couple surveys the damage to homes in port-au-prince un peacekeepers patrolling the capital said popular anger is rising and warned authorities and aid organizations to increase security to guard against looting after tuesday 's earthquake .
officials estimate 140,000 people were killed in the 7.0 magnitude quake .
around 1.5 million have been left homeless in what the united nations described as the worst disaster it has ever been confronted with .
un spokeswoman elisabeth byrs said damage to the country 's infracture and government losses have made it harder for relief agencies to work than after the asian tsunami of 2004 .
" the whole country is in despair and it 's overwhelming the international community , " said byrs in a televised interview .
un suffers losses united nations secretary general ban ki-moon visited port-au-prince and toured the ruins of the un mission on sunday and then met with haitian president rene preval .
before departing , ban said the three main priorities in haiti were to save as many people as possible , to bring emergency humanitarian aid in the form of water , food and medication , and to coordinate the massive aid effort .
the un announced on saturday that the chief of its stabilization mission in haiti and his deputy died in un 's headquarters in port-au-prince 's christopher hotel building .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young girl gets medical attention ban confirmed that minustah civilian chief hedi annabi , his brazilian deputy luiz carlos da costa and acting police commissioner , doug coates of the royal canadian mounted police , were confirmed to have died .
" the united nations was his life and he ranked amongst its most dedicated and committed sons , " the un chief said of tunisian annabi .
" in every sense of the word they gave their lives for peace , " the un chief added .

" the silence of pius xii before the shoah , still hurts because something should have been done , " said the president of rome 's jewish community , riccardo pacifici .
" maybe it would not have stopped the death trains , but it would have sent a signal , a word of extreme comfort , of human solidarity , towards those brothers of ours transported to the ovens of auschwitz , " he said .
pacifici urged the vatican to open its archives and give historians access to documents which would shed light on the actions of the wartime pontiff .

as he started his landmark visit to rome 's main synagogue on sunday , january 17 , benedict xvi paid homage to more than 1,000 roman jews deported to nazi death camps .

the decision had resulted in an outcry by critics and jewish communities around the world who accuse pius xii of having failed to speak out against the holocaust .
pius xii 's papacy ran from 1939 until 1958 .
ahead of the visit to the synagogue , the president of italy 's assembly of rabbis , giuseppe laras , announced he would not attend the event and criticised benedict for weakening the ties between the two religions .
laras said the pope failed to show an " understanding of the feelings of the jewish community . "
another controversial move by pope benedict xvi was the decision to speed rapprochement with a catholic fraternity that includes holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson .
benedict xvi is the second modern pope to visit the rome synagogue .
his predecessor john paul ii first visited the place of worship in 1986 and at the time had been warmly welcomed for his efforts to mend tensions between the two religions .

" the silence of pius xii before the shoah , still hurts because something should have been done , " said the president of rome 's jewish community , riccardo pacifici .
" maybe it would not have stopped the death trains , but it would have sent a signal , a word of extreme comfort , of human solidarity , towards those brothers of ours transported to the ovens of auschwitz , " he said .
pacifici urged the vatican to open its archives and give historians access to documents which would shed light on the actions of the wartime pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope hopes his visit would ease the tensions between catholics and jews benedict xvi , however , defended the vatican 's position that the church was acting behind the scenes to help jews .
" the apostolic see itself provided assistance , often in a hidden and discreet way , " the pope said in his speech at the synagogue .
as he started his landmark visit to rome 's main synagogue on sunday , january 17 , benedict xvi paid homage to more than 1,000 roman jews deported to nazi death camps .
the catholic leader previously said his visit would open a " new phase along the irrevocable path of agreement and friendship " between catholics and jews .
rome 's chief rabbi riccardo di segni said the move was a sign that the catholic church wanted to " continue the dialogue . "
jewish community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii is accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi persecution of jews but the visit came only four weeks after the german-born pontiff found himself at the center of a controversy that served rather to divide than bring together .
in december 2009 , a papal decree bestowed the title " venerable " on world war two-era pius xii , thus putting him one step closer to sainthood .
the decision had resulted in an outcry by critics and jewish communities around the world who accuse pius xii of having failed to speak out against the holocaust .
pius xii 's papacy ran from 1939 until 1958 .
ahead of the visit to the synagogue , the president of italy 's assembly of rabbis , giuseppe laras , announced he would not attend the event and criticised benedict for weakening the ties between the two religions .
laras said the pope failed to show an " understanding of the feelings of the jewish community . "
another controversial move by pope benedict xvi was the decision to speed rapprochement with a catholic fraternity that includes holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson .
benedict xvi is the second modern pope to visit the rome synagogue .
his predecessor john paul ii first visited the place of worship in 1986 and at the time had been warmly welcomed for his efforts to mend tensions between the two religions .
failed assassin to be released meanwhile , the man who tried to kill john paul ii in 1981 will be released on monday from prison after spending almost three decades behind bars in italy and turkey .
mehmet ali agca said he wants to travel to the vatican to visit the tomb of john paul ii and to meet with the current pontiff .
agca has announced he will sell the rights to his story so that it can be turned into a book and movie . he was a 23-year-old member of a militant far-right group when on may 13 , 1981 he opened fire on john paul ii in st. peter 's square in rome , seriously wounding the pope. ai / afp / ep editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is looking to gain support from her former coalition partner , the spd the chancellor is said to have already met with social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
local media reports say the two party leaders agreed to avoid any party bickering over the afghan mission .
since last year , steinmeier 's spd boosted criticism over the mission .
the fact that merkel is attempting to foster bipartisan support on this issue reduces the chances that germany will be increasing its military presence in afghanistan - despite being under pressure to join us president barack obama 's troop surge in the country .
the spd is opposed to sending more troops to the region .
instead , it would prefer to strengthen afghan security forces through education and training .
exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants to focus on training afghan security forces the spd has also made it clear that it wants to know exactly when german troops will be withdrawn from afghanistan .
spd chief sigmar gabriel said in recent weeks that the german military must begin withdrawals by 2011 .
" in the year that the united states begins to reduce its troop levels , that means germany must also start withdrawing in 2011 , " said gabriel in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" until then , germany has to train afghan police officers and soldiers much more quickly than before . "
under german law , foreign military deployments are only allowed after parliamentary approval for fixed periods .
guttenberg told bild that the widest parliamentary agreement on afghanistan " is important to ensure our soldiers have backing . "
rough deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz airstrike was a huge blow to german public opinion over the mission currently , germany has close to 4,400 troops stationed in northern afghanistan .
in recent months , the country 's deployment faced immense controversy over a german-ordered airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers in the city of kunduz in september , when up to 142 civilians are believed to have been killed .
the causalities made the already unpopular war even more unpopular among german citizens , and forced the defense minister at the time , franz josef jung , to resign .
meanwhile , german troops killed an afghan civilian on sunday , when two men approached a german checkpoint in a car at high speed .
the soldiers fired when the vehicle showed no signs of slowing down .
the german government is expected to wait until the end of january with its decision over troop activities and levels in afghanistan .

the eu is increasingly worried about greece 's financial troubles affecting the stability of the euro currency .
next week , brussels is to vet athens ' crisis plan put forward to solve the country 's serious fiscal problems . greece is under mounting pressure from the eu to take drastic action to restore its public finances .
the country 's public spending deficit rose to 12.7 percent last year - far above the three percent permitted by the eurozone countries . the government in athens on thursday presented a crisis plan to get public spending back under control .
the three-year blueprint aims at bringing the public deficit to 8.7 percent in 2010 and eventually down to 2.8 percent by 2012 . the plan was submitted to eu on friday and next week will be examined by the eu commission . on monday , the eurozone 's economy ministers will meet while on thursday a meeting of all 27 eu economy ministers is scheduled . strong criticism from berlin the fiasco of greek 's public finances is putting a severe strain on the eurozone and has sparked a debate on whether athens could even be forced to abandon the single currency . german chancellor angela merkel broke from standard discourse this week when she pointed out her grave concerns over athens ' financial troubles . " the greece example is putting us under great , great pressure , " she said .
" the euro is in a very difficult phase for the coming years . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel was unusually frank in her comments about greece merkel subsequently was quick to say she did n't mean any direct criticism , but her somber tone expressed a concern shared by many of her colleagues across europe . there are worries that athens ' fiscal problems could threaten the credibility of the eurozone and could be a precursor to similar debt crises in weaker european economies . greece 's credit rating has been downgraded by all major international rating agencies and financial analysts have cast doubt on whether athens will be able to implement its rigorous austerity plan .
the country 's powerful unions have already announced strikes to protest the measures . no special assistance luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker warned that " it would be false to let greece believe the other eurozone countries will help it resolve its problems . " in a similar vein , european central bank head jean-claude trichet told athens that help from the eu would be very limited . " no government , no state can expect from us any special treatment .
the problem is not to get help , the problem is to help oneself , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek pm papandreou was elected last october and inherited a huge budget deficit trichet , however dismissed the notion that greece could be forced out from the eurozone because of its debt crisis .
he described suggestions that athens might resign or be expelled as an " absurd hypothesis . " the european commission is expected to give its verdict on the greek crisis plan by late january and will then forward it to the bloc 's economy commissioner , who will have to give the final approval . the greek plan promises to cut welfare spending , reform taxation , battle tax evasion and save on public sector wages . " we will achieve fiscal consolidation within three years , we will do everything it takes for this , " greek prime minister george papandreou said , expressing his confidence when presenting the plan to parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 17.01.2010 germany seeks bipartisan backing for afghan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that germany will increase its military contingent in afghanistan chancellor angela merkel is looking to cross party lines and consult with the opposition social democrats in order to secure the broadest parliamentary support for the german military 's unpopular mission to afghanistan . in an interview published on sunday , january 17 , with daily bild , german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said merkel 's government will be pushing for bipartisan support to continue german troop deployments in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is looking to gain support from her former coalition partner , the spd the chancellor is said to have already met with social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
local media reports say the two party leaders agreed to avoid any party bickering over the afghan mission .
since last year , steinmeier 's spd boosted criticism over the mission .
the fact that merkel is attempting to foster bipartisan support on this issue reduces the chances that germany will be increasing its military presence in afghanistan - despite being under pressure to join us president barack obama 's troop surge in the country .
the spd is opposed to sending more troops to the region .
instead , it would prefer to strengthen afghan security forces through education and training .
exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants to focus on training afghan security forces the spd has also made it clear that it wants to know exactly when german troops will be withdrawn from afghanistan .
spd chief sigmar gabriel said in recent weeks that the german military must begin withdrawals by 2011 .
" in the year that the united states begins to reduce its troop levels , that means germany must also start withdrawing in 2011 , " said gabriel in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" until then , germany has to train afghan police officers and soldiers much more quickly than before . "
under german law , foreign military deployments are only allowed after parliamentary approval for fixed periods .
guttenberg told bild that the widest parliamentary agreement on afghanistan " is important to ensure our soldiers have backing . "
rough deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz airstrike was a huge blow to german public opinion over the mission currently , germany has close to 4,400 troops stationed in northern afghanistan .
in recent months , the country 's deployment faced immense controversy over a german-ordered airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers in the city of kunduz in september , when up to 142 civilians are believed to have been killed .
the causalities made the already unpopular war even more unpopular among german citizens , and forced the defense minister at the time , franz josef jung , to resign .
meanwhile , german troops killed an afghan civilian on sunday , when two men approached a german checkpoint in a car at high speed .
the soldiers fired when the vehicle showed no signs of slowing down .
the german government is expected to wait until the end of january with its decision over troop activities and levels in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 17.01.2010 german news publishers file complaint against google großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : publishers want a share of google 's revenue germany 's newspaper and magazine publisher associations , the vdz and bdzv , have filed a complaint with the country 's federal cartel office against us internet giant google . germany 's cartel office is also dealing with two other complaints against google : one from a social-networking site for shoppers , ciao , which is owned by microsoft , and one from an online maps company , euro-cities .
the german publisher associations have previously complained that google profits from their online content without offering them a fair share of advertising revenue .
although details as to the exact nature of the complaint have not yet been released , the main concern is believed to revolve around " snippets " from media websites and news articles which show up in search results on google news . publishers say google has not paid for the use of these articles , and that regulations must be tightened to protect the authors from plagiarism .
the associations also say the way search results are currently listed is unfair .
in november , a bdzv official said his group wanted to know why some google news results were ranked higher than others .
google facing three complaints the vdz and bdzv 's concerns about google 's business practices are shared by shopping site , ciao , and map company , euro-cities .
ciao 's complaint is related to a contract about google 's automatic advertising system , adsense , which ciao signed before it was bought by microsoft .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- reported that ciao believes the contract to be overly restrictive , while not offering enough transparency on advertising revenues generated by adsense .
bildunterschrift : euro-cities says its business model is threatened by google maps euro-cities is unhappy with the fact that maps from google maps are being integrated on other internet sites for free , saying the practice is destroying its business model , the faz reported .
none of the complainants have officially commented on the issue .
euro-cities chief executive hans biermann said the parties agreed with the cartel office not to make the case fully public until january 20 .
google denies wrongdoing google 's german spokesman kay oberbeck says the company is confident it has done nothing wrong .
" we are very willing to explain our products and business practices to the cartel office and show that we are convinced these are in line with german and european law , " oberbeck said .

" the silence of pius xii before the shoah , still hurts because something should have been done , " said the president of rome 's jewish community , riccardo pacifici .
" maybe it would not have stopped the death trains , but it would have sent a signal , a word of extreme comfort , of human solidarity , towards those brothers of ours transported to the ovens of auschwitz , " he said .
pacifici urged the vatican to open its archives and give historians access to documents which would shed light on the actions of the wartime pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope hopes his visit would ease the tensions between catholics and jews benedict xvi , however , defended the vatican 's position that the church was acting behind the scenes to help jews .
" the apostolic see itself provided assistance , often in a hidden and discreet way , " the pope said in his speech at the synagogue .
as he started his landmark visit to rome 's main synagogue on sunday , january 17 , benedict xvi paid homage to more than 1,000 roman jews deported to nazi death camps .
the catholic leader previously said his visit would open a " new phase along the irrevocable path of agreement and friendship " between catholics and jews .
rome 's chief rabbi riccardo di segni said the move was a sign that the catholic church wanted to " continue the dialogue . "
jewish community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii is accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi persecution of jews but the visit came only four weeks after the german-born pontiff found himself at the center of a controversy that served rather to divide than bring together .
in december 2009 , a papal decree bestowed the title " venerable " on world war two-era pius xii , thus putting him one step closer to sainthood .
the decision had resulted in an outcry by critics and jewish communities around the world who accuse pius xii of having failed to speak out against the holocaust .
pius xii 's papacy ran from 1939 until 1958 .
ahead of the visit to the synagogue , the president of italy 's assembly of rabbis , giuseppe laras , announced he would not attend the event and criticised benedict for weakening the ties between the two religions .
laras said the pope failed to show an " understanding of the feelings of the jewish community . "
another controversial move by pope benedict xvi was the decision to speed rapprochement with a catholic fraternity that includes holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson .
benedict xvi is the second modern pope to visit the rome synagogue .
his predecessor john paul ii first visited the place of worship in 1986 and at the time had been warmly welcomed for his efforts to mend tensions between the two religions .
failed assassin to be released meanwhile , the man who tried to kill john paul ii in 1981 will be released on monday from prison after spending almost three decades behind bars in italy and turkey .
mehmet ali agca said he wants to travel to the vatican to visit the tomb of john paul ii and to meet with the current pontiff .
agca has announced he will sell the rights to his story so that it can be turned into a book and movie . he was a 23-year-old member of a militant far-right group when on may 13 , 1981 he opened fire on john paul ii in st. peter 's square in rome , seriously wounding the pope. ai / afp / ep editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the haitian government says up to 200,000 people may have died . with aid agencies struggling to deliver relief supplies , us secretary of state hillary clinton has promised long-term assistance to the caribbean nation .
after an hour-long meeting with haiti 's president rene preval in port-au-prince , clinton told journalists : " as president barack obama has said , we will be here today , tomorrow and for the time ahead . "
clinton arrived in port-au-prince on saturday evening after travelling to the devastated capital aboard a us coast guard plane .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haiti 's president rene preval and us secretary of state hillary clinton in port-au-prince " i know the resilience and strength of the haitian people .
you have been severely tested , " clinton said .
" but i believe that haiti can come back stronger and better in the future . "
the us relief operation has been officially dubbed " operation unified response , " general douglas fraser , head of the us southern command , said on the command 's official page on twitter .
clinton emphasized that that the u.s. relief operation – involving thousands of soldiers , sailors and marines along with civilian aid workers - was done at the invitation of haiti 's government .
flanked by former presidents bill clinton and george w. bush , us president barack obama on saturday issued a united appeal for haiti 's quake victims .
sporadic fighting by armed gangs and reports of widespread looting have hampered rescue efforts .
a strong aftershock measuring 4.5 on the richter scale also temporarily halted aid operations as desperate survivors struggled to find food and water .
bildunterschrift : a couple surveys the damage to homes in port-au-prince un peacekeepers patrolling the capital said popular anger is rising and warned authorities and aid organizations to increase security to guard against looting after tuesday 's earthquake .
officials estimate 140,000 people were killed in the 7.0 magnitude quake .
around 1.5 million have been left homeless in what the united nations described as the worst disaster it has ever been confronted with .
un spokeswoman elisabeth byrs said damage to the country 's infracture and government losses have made it harder for relief agencies to work than after the asian tsunami of 2004 .

the german publisher associations have previously complained that google profits from their online content without offering them a fair share of advertising revenue .
although details as to the exact nature of the complaint have not yet been released , the main concern is believed to revolve around " snippets " from media websites and news articles which show up in search results on google news . publishers say google has not paid for the use of these articles , and that regulations must be tightened to protect the authors from plagiarism .
the associations also say the way search results are currently listed is unfair .
in november , a bdzv official said his group wanted to know why some google news results were ranked higher than others .
google facing three complaints the vdz and bdzv 's concerns about google 's business practices are shared by shopping site , ciao , and map company , euro-cities .
ciao 's complaint is related to a contract about google 's automatic advertising system , adsense , which ciao signed before it was bought by microsoft .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- reported that ciao believes the contract to be overly restrictive , while not offering enough transparency on advertising revenues generated by adsense .
bildunterschrift : euro-cities says its business model is threatened by google maps euro-cities is unhappy with the fact that maps from google maps are being integrated on other internet sites for free , saying the practice is destroying its business model , the faz reported .
none of the complainants have officially commented on the issue .
euro-cities chief executive hans biermann said the parties agreed with the cartel office not to make the case fully public until january 20 .
google denies wrongdoing google 's german spokesman kay oberbeck says the company is confident it has done nothing wrong .
" we are very willing to explain our products and business practices to the cartel office and show that we are convinced these are in line with german and european law , " oberbeck said .
oberbeck added the company paid 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to publishers worldwide in 2009 .
in germany alone , google earns close to 1.2 billion euros a year on ads placed next to regular search results. mk / dc / dpa / apn editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 17.01.2010 germany seeks bipartisan backing for afghan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that germany will increase its military contingent in afghanistan chancellor angela merkel is looking to cross party lines and consult with the opposition social democrats in order to secure the broadest parliamentary support for the german military 's unpopular mission to afghanistan . in an interview published on sunday , january 17 , with daily bild , german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said merkel 's government will be pushing for bipartisan support to continue german troop deployments in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is looking to gain support from her former coalition partner , the spd the chancellor is said to have already met with social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
local media reports say the two party leaders agreed to avoid any party bickering over the afghan mission .
since last year , steinmeier 's spd boosted criticism over the mission .
the fact that merkel is attempting to foster bipartisan support on this issue reduces the chances that germany will be increasing its military presence in afghanistan - despite being under pressure to join us president barack obama 's troop surge in the country .
the spd is opposed to sending more troops to the region .
instead , it would prefer to strengthen afghan security forces through education and training .
exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants to focus on training afghan security forces the spd has also made it clear that it wants to know exactly when german troops will be withdrawn from afghanistan .
spd chief sigmar gabriel said in recent weeks that the german military must begin withdrawals by 2011 .
" in the year that the united states begins to reduce its troop levels , that means germany must also start withdrawing in 2011 , " said gabriel in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" until then , germany has to train afghan police officers and soldiers much more quickly than before . "
under german law , foreign military deployments are only allowed after parliamentary approval for fixed periods .
guttenberg told bild that the widest parliamentary agreement on afghanistan " is important to ensure our soldiers have backing . "
rough deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz airstrike was a huge blow to german public opinion over the mission currently , germany has close to 4,400 troops stationed in northern afghanistan .
in recent months , the country 's deployment faced immense controversy over a german-ordered airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers in the city of kunduz in september , when up to 142 civilians are believed to have been killed .
the causalities made the already unpopular war even more unpopular among german citizens , and forced the defense minister at the time , franz josef jung , to resign .
meanwhile , german troops killed an afghan civilian on sunday , when two men approached a german checkpoint in a car at high speed .
the soldiers fired when the vehicle showed no signs of slowing down .
the german government is expected to wait until the end of january with its decision over troop activities and levels in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 17.01.2010 germany seeks bipartisan backing for afghan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that germany will increase its military contingent in afghanistan chancellor angela merkel is looking to cross party lines and consult with the opposition social democrats in order to secure the broadest parliamentary support for the german military 's unpopular mission to afghanistan . in an interview published on sunday , january 17 , with daily bild , german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said merkel 's government will be pushing for bipartisan support to continue german troop deployments in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is looking to gain support from her former coalition partner , the spd the chancellor is said to have already met with social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
local media reports say the two party leaders agreed to avoid any party bickering over the afghan mission .
since last year , steinmeier 's spd boosted criticism over the mission .
the fact that merkel is attempting to foster bipartisan support on this issue reduces the chances that germany will be increasing its military presence in afghanistan - despite being under pressure to join us president barack obama 's troop surge in the country .
the spd is opposed to sending more troops to the region .
instead , it would prefer to strengthen afghan security forces through education and training .
exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants to focus on training afghan security forces the spd has also made it clear that it wants to know exactly when german troops will be withdrawn from afghanistan .
spd chief sigmar gabriel said in recent weeks that the german military must begin withdrawals by 2011 .
" in the year that the united states begins to reduce its troop levels , that means germany must also start withdrawing in 2011 , " said gabriel in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" until then , germany has to train afghan police officers and soldiers much more quickly than before . "
under german law , foreign military deployments are only allowed after parliamentary approval for fixed periods .
guttenberg told bild that the widest parliamentary agreement on afghanistan " is important to ensure our soldiers have backing . "
rough deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz airstrike was a huge blow to german public opinion over the mission currently , germany has close to 4,400 troops stationed in northern afghanistan .
in recent months , the country 's deployment faced immense controversy over a german-ordered airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers in the city of kunduz in september , when up to 142 civilians are believed to have been killed .
the causalities made the already unpopular war even more unpopular among german citizens , and forced the defense minister at the time , franz josef jung , to resign .
meanwhile , german troops killed an afghan civilian on sunday , when two men approached a german checkpoint in a car at high speed .
the soldiers fired when the vehicle showed no signs of slowing down .
the german government is expected to wait until the end of january with its decision over troop activities and levels in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 17.01.2010 germany seeks bipartisan backing for afghan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that germany will increase its military contingent in afghanistan chancellor angela merkel is looking to cross party lines and consult with the opposition social democrats in order to secure the broadest parliamentary support for the german military 's unpopular mission to afghanistan . in an interview published on sunday , january 17 , with daily bild , german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said merkel 's government will be pushing for bipartisan support to continue german troop deployments in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is looking to gain support from her former coalition partner , the spd the chancellor is said to have already met with social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
local media reports say the two party leaders agreed to avoid any party bickering over the afghan mission .
since last year , steinmeier 's spd boosted criticism over the mission .
the fact that merkel is attempting to foster bipartisan support on this issue reduces the chances that germany will be increasing its military presence in afghanistan - despite being under pressure to join us president barack obama 's troop surge in the country .
the spd is opposed to sending more troops to the region .
instead , it would prefer to strengthen afghan security forces through education and training .
exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants to focus on training afghan security forces the spd has also made it clear that it wants to know exactly when german troops will be withdrawn from afghanistan .
spd chief sigmar gabriel said in recent weeks that the german military must begin withdrawals by 2011 .
" in the year that the united states begins to reduce its troop levels , that means germany must also start withdrawing in 2011 , " said gabriel in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" until then , germany has to train afghan police officers and soldiers much more quickly than before . "
under german law , foreign military deployments are only allowed after parliamentary approval for fixed periods .
guttenberg told bild that the widest parliamentary agreement on afghanistan " is important to ensure our soldiers have backing . "
rough deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz airstrike was a huge blow to german public opinion over the mission currently , germany has close to 4,400 troops stationed in northern afghanistan .
in recent months , the country 's deployment faced immense controversy over a german-ordered airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers in the city of kunduz in september , when up to 142 civilians are believed to have been killed .
the causalities made the already unpopular war even more unpopular among german citizens , and forced the defense minister at the time , franz josef jung , to resign .
meanwhile , german troops killed an afghan civilian on sunday , when two men approached a german checkpoint in a car at high speed .
the soldiers fired when the vehicle showed no signs of slowing down .
the german government is expected to wait until the end of january with its decision over troop activities and levels in afghanistan .

a recent survey by the forsa institute showed that opposition parties actually had higher support than the coalition for the first time since the merkel started her second term . as for merkel herself , a dimap survey in early january showed public satisfaction with merkel 's job performance went down 11 points from the previous month , bringing it to 59 percent . another survey showed 52 percent of voters felt merkel was not doing enough to set a direct course of action for the government . mk / afp / ap / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is looking to gain support from her former coalition partner , the spd the chancellor is said to have already met with social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
local media reports say the two party leaders agreed to avoid any party bickering over the afghan mission .
since last year , steinmeier 's spd boosted criticism over the mission .
the fact that merkel is attempting to foster bipartisan support on this issue reduces the chances that germany will be increasing its military presence in afghanistan - despite being under pressure to join us president barack obama 's troop surge in the country .
the spd is opposed to sending more troops to the region .
instead , it would prefer to strengthen afghan security forces through education and training .
exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants to focus on training afghan security forces the spd has also made it clear that it wants to know exactly when german troops will be withdrawn from afghanistan .
spd chief sigmar gabriel said in recent weeks that the german military must begin withdrawals by 2011 .
" in the year that the united states begins to reduce its troop levels , that means germany must also start withdrawing in 2011 , " said gabriel in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" until then , germany has to train afghan police officers and soldiers much more quickly than before . "
under german law , foreign military deployments are only allowed after parliamentary approval for fixed periods .
guttenberg told bild that the widest parliamentary agreement on afghanistan " is important to ensure our soldiers have backing . "
rough deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz airstrike was a huge blow to german public opinion over the mission currently , germany has close to 4,400 troops stationed in northern afghanistan .
in recent months , the country 's deployment faced immense controversy over a german-ordered airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers in the city of kunduz in september , when up to 142 civilians are believed to have been killed .
the causalities made the already unpopular war even more unpopular among german citizens , and forced the defense minister at the time , franz josef jung , to resign .
meanwhile , german troops killed an afghan civilian on sunday , when two men approached a german checkpoint in a car at high speed .
the soldiers fired when the vehicle showed no signs of slowing down .
the german government is expected to wait until the end of january with its decision over troop activities and levels in afghanistan .

the german publisher associations have previously complained that google profits from their online content without offering them a fair share of advertising revenue .
although details as to the exact nature of the complaint have not yet been released , the main concern is believed to revolve around " snippets " from media websites and news articles which show up in search results on google news . publishers say google has not paid for the use of these articles , and that regulations must be tightened to protect the authors from plagiarism .
the associations also say the way search results are currently listed is unfair .
in november , a bdzv official said his group wanted to know why some google news results were ranked higher than others .
google facing three complaints the vdz and bdzv 's concerns about google 's business practices are shared by shopping site , ciao , and map company , euro-cities .
ciao 's complaint is related to a contract about google 's automatic advertising system , adsense , which ciao signed before it was bought by microsoft .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- reported that ciao believes the contract to be overly restrictive , while not offering enough transparency on advertising revenues generated by adsense .
bildunterschrift : euro-cities says its business model is threatened by google maps euro-cities is unhappy with the fact that maps from google maps are being integrated on other internet sites for free , saying the practice is destroying its business model , the faz reported .
none of the complainants have officially commented on the issue .
euro-cities chief executive hans biermann said the parties agreed with the cartel office not to make the case fully public until january 20 .
google denies wrongdoing google 's german spokesman kay oberbeck says the company is confident it has done nothing wrong .
" we are very willing to explain our products and business practices to the cartel office and show that we are convinced these are in line with german and european law , " oberbeck said .
oberbeck added the company paid 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to publishers worldwide in 2009 .
in germany alone , google earns close to 1.2 billion euros a year on ads placed next to regular search results. mk / dc / dpa / apn editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is looking to gain support from her former coalition partner , the spd the chancellor is said to have already met with social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
local media reports say the two party leaders agreed to avoid any party bickering over the afghan mission .
since last year , steinmeier 's spd boosted criticism over the mission .
the fact that merkel is attempting to foster bipartisan support on this issue reduces the chances that germany will be increasing its military presence in afghanistan - despite being under pressure to join us president barack obama 's troop surge in the country .
the spd is opposed to sending more troops to the region .
instead , it would prefer to strengthen afghan security forces through education and training .
exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants to focus on training afghan security forces the spd has also made it clear that it wants to know exactly when german troops will be withdrawn from afghanistan .
spd chief sigmar gabriel said in recent weeks that the german military must begin withdrawals by 2011 .
" in the year that the united states begins to reduce its troop levels , that means germany must also start withdrawing in 2011 , " said gabriel in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" until then , germany has to train afghan police officers and soldiers much more quickly than before . "
under german law , foreign military deployments are only allowed after parliamentary approval for fixed periods .
guttenberg told bild that the widest parliamentary agreement on afghanistan " is important to ensure our soldiers have backing . "
rough deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz airstrike was a huge blow to german public opinion over the mission currently , germany has close to 4,400 troops stationed in northern afghanistan .
in recent months , the country 's deployment faced immense controversy over a german-ordered airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers in the city of kunduz in september , when up to 142 civilians are believed to have been killed .
the causalities made the already unpopular war even more unpopular among german citizens , and forced the defense minister at the time , franz josef jung , to resign .
meanwhile , german troops killed an afghan civilian on sunday , when two men approached a german checkpoint in a car at high speed .
the soldiers fired when the vehicle showed no signs of slowing down .

after an hour-long meeting with haiti 's president rene preval in port-au-prince , clinton told journalists : " as president barack obama has said , we will be here today , tomorrow and for the time ahead . "
clinton arrived in port-au-prince on saturday evening after travelling to the devastated capital aboard a us coast guard plane .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haiti 's president rene preval and us secretary of state hillary clinton in port-au-prince " i know the resilience and strength of the haitian people .

the us relief operation has been officially dubbed " operation unified response , " general douglas fraser , head of the us southern command , said on the command 's official page on twitter .

around 1.5 million have been left homeless in what the united nations described as the worst disaster it has ever been confronted with .
un spokeswoman elisabeth byrs said damage to the country 's infracture and government losses have made it harder for relief agencies to work than after the asian tsunami of 2004 .
" the whole country is in despair and it 's overwhelming the international community , " said byrs in a televised interview .
un suffers losses united nations secretary general ban ki-moon visited port-au-prince and toured the ruins of the un mission on sunday and then met with haitian president rene preval .
before departing , ban said the three main priorities in haiti were to save as many people as possible , to bring emergency humanitarian aid in the form of water , food and medication , and to coordinate the massive aid effort .
the un announced on saturday that the chief of its stabilization mission in haiti and his deputy died in un 's headquarters in port-au-prince 's christopher hotel building .

" the united nations was his life and he ranked amongst its most dedicated and committed sons , " the un chief said of tunisian annabi .
" in every sense of the word they gave their lives for peace , " the un chief added .
the three deaths announced saturday brought to 40 the number of un staffers confirmed dead in the quake , with nearly 330 others still unaccounted for .

" the silence of pius xii before the shoah , still hurts because something should have been done , " said the president of rome 's jewish community , riccardo pacifici .
" maybe it would not have stopped the death trains , but it would have sent a signal , a word of extreme comfort , of human solidarity , towards those brothers of ours transported to the ovens of auschwitz , " he said .
pacifici urged the vatican to open its archives and give historians access to documents which would shed light on the actions of the wartime pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope hopes his visit would ease the tensions between catholics and jews benedict xvi , however , defended the vatican 's position that the church was acting behind the scenes to help jews .
" the apostolic see itself provided assistance , often in a hidden and discreet way , " the pope said in his speech at the synagogue .
as he started his landmark visit to rome 's main synagogue on sunday , january 17 , benedict xvi paid homage to more than 1,000 roman jews deported to nazi death camps .
the catholic leader previously said his visit would open a " new phase along the irrevocable path of agreement and friendship " between catholics and jews .
rome 's chief rabbi riccardo di segni said the move was a sign that the catholic church wanted to " continue the dialogue . "
jewish community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii is accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi persecution of jews but the visit came only four weeks after the german-born pontiff found himself at the center of a controversy that served rather to divide than bring together .
in december 2009 , a papal decree bestowed the title " venerable " on world war two-era pius xii , thus putting him one step closer to sainthood .
the decision had resulted in an outcry by critics and jewish communities around the world who accuse pius xii of having failed to speak out against the holocaust .
pius xii 's papacy ran from 1939 until 1958 .
ahead of the visit to the synagogue , the president of italy 's assembly of rabbis , giuseppe laras , announced he would not attend the event and criticised benedict for weakening the ties between the two religions .
laras said the pope failed to show an " understanding of the feelings of the jewish community . "
another controversial move by pope benedict xvi was the decision to speed rapprochement with a catholic fraternity that includes holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson .
benedict xvi is the second modern pope to visit the rome synagogue .
his predecessor john paul ii first visited the place of worship in 1986 and at the time had been warmly welcomed for his efforts to mend tensions between the two religions .
failed assassin to be released meanwhile , the man who tried to kill john paul ii in 1981 will be released on monday from prison after spending almost three decades behind bars in italy and turkey .
mehmet ali agca said he wants to travel to the vatican to visit the tomb of john paul ii and to meet with the current pontiff .
agca has announced he will sell the rights to his story so that it can be turned into a book and movie . he was a 23-year-old member of a militant far-right group when on may 13 , 1981 he opened fire on john paul ii in st. peter 's square in rome , seriously wounding the pope. ai / afp / ep editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the silence of pius xii before the shoah , still hurts because something should have been done , " said the president of rome 's jewish community , riccardo pacifici .
" maybe it would not have stopped the death trains , but it would have sent a signal , a word of extreme comfort , of human solidarity , towards those brothers of ours transported to the ovens of auschwitz , " he said .
pacifici urged the vatican to open its archives and give historians access to documents which would shed light on the actions of the wartime pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope hopes his visit would ease the tensions between catholics and jews benedict xvi , however , defended the vatican 's position that the church was acting behind the scenes to help jews .
" the apostolic see itself provided assistance , often in a hidden and discreet way , " the pope said in his speech at the synagogue .
as he started his landmark visit to rome 's main synagogue on sunday , january 17 , benedict xvi paid homage to more than 1,000 roman jews deported to nazi death camps .
the catholic leader previously said his visit would open a " new phase along the irrevocable path of agreement and friendship " between catholics and jews .
rome 's chief rabbi riccardo di segni said the move was a sign that the catholic church wanted to " continue the dialogue . "
jewish community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii is accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi persecution of jews but the visit came only four weeks after the german-born pontiff found himself at the center of a controversy that served rather to divide than bring together .
in december 2009 , a papal decree bestowed the title " venerable " on world war two-era pius xii , thus putting him one step closer to sainthood .
the decision had resulted in an outcry by critics and jewish communities around the world who accuse pius xii of having failed to speak out against the holocaust .
pius xii 's papacy ran from 1939 until 1958 .
ahead of the visit to the synagogue , the president of italy 's assembly of rabbis , giuseppe laras , announced he would not attend the event and criticised benedict for weakening the ties between the two religions .
laras said the pope failed to show an " understanding of the feelings of the jewish community . "
another controversial move by pope benedict xvi was the decision to speed rapprochement with a catholic fraternity that includes holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson .
benedict xvi is the second modern pope to visit the rome synagogue .
his predecessor john paul ii first visited the place of worship in 1986 and at the time had been warmly welcomed for his efforts to mend tensions between the two religions .
failed assassin to be released meanwhile , the man who tried to kill john paul ii in 1981 will be released on monday from prison after spending almost three decades behind bars in italy and turkey .
mehmet ali agca said he wants to travel to the vatican to visit the tomb of john paul ii and to meet with the current pontiff .
agca has announced he will sell the rights to his story so that it can be turned into a book and movie . he was a 23-year-old member of a militant far-right group when on may 13 , 1981 he opened fire on john paul ii in st. peter 's square in rome , seriously wounding the pope. ai / afp / ep editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu is increasingly worried about greece 's financial troubles affecting the stability of the euro currency .
next week , brussels is to vet athens ' crisis plan put forward to solve the country 's serious fiscal problems . greece is under mounting pressure from the eu to take drastic action to restore its public finances .
the country 's public spending deficit rose to 12.7 percent last year - far above the three percent permitted by the eurozone countries . the government in athens on thursday presented a crisis plan to get public spending back under control .
the three-year blueprint aims at bringing the public deficit to 8.7 percent in 2010 and eventually down to 2.8 percent by 2012 . the plan was submitted to eu on friday and next week will be examined by the eu commission . on monday , the eurozone 's economy ministers will meet while on thursday a meeting of all 27 eu economy ministers is scheduled . strong criticism from berlin the fiasco of greek 's public finances is putting a severe strain on the eurozone and has sparked a debate on whether athens could even be forced to abandon the single currency . german chancellor angela merkel broke from standard discourse this week when she pointed out her grave concerns over athens ' financial troubles . " the greece example is putting us under great , great pressure , " she said .
" the euro is in a very difficult phase for the coming years . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel was unusually frank in her comments about greece merkel subsequently was quick to say she did n't mean any direct criticism , but her somber tone expressed a concern shared by many of her colleagues across europe . there are worries that athens ' fiscal problems could threaten the credibility of the eurozone and could be a precursor to similar debt crises in weaker european economies . greece 's credit rating has been downgraded by all major international rating agencies and financial analysts have cast doubt on whether athens will be able to implement its rigorous austerity plan .
the country 's powerful unions have already announced strikes to protest the measures . no special assistance luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker warned that " it would be false to let greece believe the other eurozone countries will help it resolve its problems . " in a similar vein , european central bank head jean-claude trichet told athens that help from the eu would be very limited . " no government , no state can expect from us any special treatment .
the problem is not to get help , the problem is to help oneself , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek pm papandreou was elected last october and inherited a huge budget deficit trichet , however dismissed the notion that greece could be forced out from the eurozone because of its debt crisis .
he described suggestions that athens might resign or be expelled as an " absurd hypothesis . " the european commission is expected to give its verdict on the greek crisis plan by late january and will then forward it to the bloc 's economy commissioner , who will have to give the final approval . the greek plan promises to cut welfare spending , reform taxation , battle tax evasion and save on public sector wages . " we will achieve fiscal consolidation within three years , we will do everything it takes for this , " greek prime minister george papandreou said , expressing his confidence when presenting the plan to parliament .
" we can do it , this target is feasible . " ai / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the silence of pius xii before the shoah , still hurts because something should have been done , " said the president of rome 's jewish community , riccardo pacifici .
" maybe it would not have stopped the death trains , but it would have sent a signal , a word of extreme comfort , of human solidarity , towards those brothers of ours transported to the ovens of auschwitz , " he said .
pacifici urged the vatican to open its archives and give historians access to documents which would shed light on the actions of the wartime pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope hopes his visit would ease the tensions between catholics and jews benedict xvi , however , defended the vatican 's position that the church was acting behind the scenes to help jews .
" the apostolic see itself provided assistance , often in a hidden and discreet way , " the pope said in his speech at the synagogue .
as he started his landmark visit to rome 's main synagogue on sunday , january 17 , benedict xvi paid homage to more than 1,000 roman jews deported to nazi death camps .
the catholic leader previously said his visit would open a " new phase along the irrevocable path of agreement and friendship " between catholics and jews .
rome 's chief rabbi riccardo di segni said the move was a sign that the catholic church wanted to " continue the dialogue . "
jewish community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii is accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi persecution of jews but the visit came only four weeks after the german-born pontiff found himself at the center of a controversy that served rather to divide than bring together .
in december 2009 , a papal decree bestowed the title " venerable " on world war two-era pius xii , thus putting him one step closer to sainthood .
the decision had resulted in an outcry by critics and jewish communities around the world who accuse pius xii of having failed to speak out against the holocaust .
pius xii 's papacy ran from 1939 until 1958 .
ahead of the visit to the synagogue , the president of italy 's assembly of rabbis , giuseppe laras , announced he would not attend the event and criticised benedict for weakening the ties between the two religions .
laras said the pope failed to show an " understanding of the feelings of the jewish community . "
another controversial move by pope benedict xvi was the decision to speed rapprochement with a catholic fraternity that includes holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson .
benedict xvi is the second modern pope to visit the rome synagogue .
his predecessor john paul ii first visited the place of worship in 1986 and at the time had been warmly welcomed for his efforts to mend tensions between the two religions .
failed assassin to be released meanwhile , the man who tried to kill john paul ii in 1981 will be released on monday from prison after spending almost three decades behind bars in italy and turkey .
mehmet ali agca said he wants to travel to the vatican to visit the tomb of john paul ii and to meet with the current pontiff .
agca has announced he will sell the rights to his story so that it can be turned into a book and movie . he was a 23-year-old member of a militant far-right group when on may 13 , 1981 he opened fire on john paul ii in st. peter 's square in rome , seriously wounding the pope. ai / afp / ep editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 17.01.2010 germany seeks bipartisan backing for afghan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that germany will increase its military contingent in afghanistan chancellor angela merkel is looking to cross party lines and consult with the opposition social democrats in order to secure the broadest parliamentary support for the german military 's unpopular mission to afghanistan . in an interview published on sunday , january 17 , with daily bild , german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said merkel 's government will be pushing for bipartisan support to continue german troop deployments in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is looking to gain support from her former coalition partner , the spd the chancellor is said to have already met with social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
local media reports say the two party leaders agreed to avoid any party bickering over the afghan mission .
since last year , steinmeier 's spd boosted criticism over the mission .
the fact that merkel is attempting to foster bipartisan support on this issue reduces the chances that germany will be increasing its military presence in afghanistan - despite being under pressure to join us president barack obama 's troop surge in the country .
the spd is opposed to sending more troops to the region .
instead , it would prefer to strengthen afghan security forces through education and training .
exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants to focus on training afghan security forces the spd has also made it clear that it wants to know exactly when german troops will be withdrawn from afghanistan .
spd chief sigmar gabriel said in recent weeks that the german military must begin withdrawals by 2011 .
" in the year that the united states begins to reduce its troop levels , that means germany must also start withdrawing in 2011 , " said gabriel in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" until then , germany has to train afghan police officers and soldiers much more quickly than before . "
under german law , foreign military deployments are only allowed after parliamentary approval for fixed periods .
guttenberg told bild that the widest parliamentary agreement on afghanistan " is important to ensure our soldiers have backing . "
rough deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz airstrike was a huge blow to german public opinion over the mission currently , germany has close to 4,400 troops stationed in northern afghanistan .
in recent months , the country 's deployment faced immense controversy over a german-ordered airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers in the city of kunduz in september , when up to 142 civilians are believed to have been killed .
the causalities made the already unpopular war even more unpopular among german citizens , and forced the defense minister at the time , franz josef jung , to resign .
meanwhile , german troops killed an afghan civilian on sunday , when two men approached a german checkpoint in a car at high speed .
the soldiers fired when the vehicle showed no signs of slowing down .
the german government is expected to wait until the end of january with its decision over troop activities and levels in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 17.01.2010 germany seeks bipartisan backing for afghan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that germany will increase its military contingent in afghanistan chancellor angela merkel is looking to cross party lines and consult with the opposition social democrats in order to secure the broadest parliamentary support for the german military 's unpopular mission to afghanistan . in an interview published on sunday , january 17 , with daily bild , german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said merkel 's government will be pushing for bipartisan support to continue german troop deployments in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is looking to gain support from her former coalition partner , the spd the chancellor is said to have already met with social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
local media reports say the two party leaders agreed to avoid any party bickering over the afghan mission .
since last year , steinmeier 's spd boosted criticism over the mission .
the fact that merkel is attempting to foster bipartisan support on this issue reduces the chances that germany will be increasing its military presence in afghanistan - despite being under pressure to join us president barack obama 's troop surge in the country .
the spd is opposed to sending more troops to the region .
instead , it would prefer to strengthen afghan security forces through education and training .
exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants to focus on training afghan security forces the spd has also made it clear that it wants to know exactly when german troops will be withdrawn from afghanistan .
spd chief sigmar gabriel said in recent weeks that the german military must begin withdrawals by 2011 .
" in the year that the united states begins to reduce its troop levels , that means germany must also start withdrawing in 2011 , " said gabriel in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" until then , germany has to train afghan police officers and soldiers much more quickly than before . "
under german law , foreign military deployments are only allowed after parliamentary approval for fixed periods .
guttenberg told bild that the widest parliamentary agreement on afghanistan " is important to ensure our soldiers have backing . "
rough deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz airstrike was a huge blow to german public opinion over the mission currently , germany has close to 4,400 troops stationed in northern afghanistan .
in recent months , the country 's deployment faced immense controversy over a german-ordered airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers in the city of kunduz in september , when up to 142 civilians are believed to have been killed .
the causalities made the already unpopular war even more unpopular among german citizens , and forced the defense minister at the time , franz josef jung , to resign .
meanwhile , german troops killed an afghan civilian on sunday , when two men approached a german checkpoint in a car at high speed .
the soldiers fired when the vehicle showed no signs of slowing down .
the german government is expected to wait until the end of january with its decision over troop activities and levels in afghanistan .

" the silence of pius xii before the shoah , still hurts because something should have been done , " said the president of rome 's jewish community , riccardo pacifici .
" maybe it would not have stopped the death trains , but it would have sent a signal , a word of extreme comfort , of human solidarity , towards those brothers of ours transported to the ovens of auschwitz , " he said .
pacifici urged the vatican to open its archives and give historians access to documents which would shed light on the actions of the wartime pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope hopes his visit would ease the tensions between catholics and jews benedict xvi , however , defended the vatican 's position that the church was acting behind the scenes to help jews .
" the apostolic see itself provided assistance , often in a hidden and discreet way , " the pope said in his speech at the synagogue .
as he started his landmark visit to rome 's main synagogue on sunday , january 17 , benedict xvi paid homage to more than 1,000 roman jews deported to nazi death camps .
the catholic leader previously said his visit would open a " new phase along the irrevocable path of agreement and friendship " between catholics and jews .
rome 's chief rabbi riccardo di segni said the move was a sign that the catholic church wanted to " continue the dialogue . "
jewish community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii is accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi persecution of jews but the visit came only four weeks after the german-born pontiff found himself at the center of a controversy that served rather to divide than bring together .
in december 2009 , a papal decree bestowed the title " venerable " on world war two-era pius xii , thus putting him one step closer to sainthood .
the decision had resulted in an outcry by critics and jewish communities around the world who accuse pius xii of having failed to speak out against the holocaust .
pius xii 's papacy ran from 1939 until 1958 .
ahead of the visit to the synagogue , the president of italy 's assembly of rabbis , giuseppe laras , announced he would not attend the event and criticised benedict for weakening the ties between the two religions .
laras said the pope failed to show an " understanding of the feelings of the jewish community . "
another controversial move by pope benedict xvi was the decision to speed rapprochement with a catholic fraternity that includes holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson .
benedict xvi is the second modern pope to visit the rome synagogue .
his predecessor john paul ii first visited the place of worship in 1986 and at the time had been warmly welcomed for his efforts to mend tensions between the two religions .
failed assassin to be released meanwhile , the man who tried to kill john paul ii in 1981 will be released on monday from prison after spending almost three decades behind bars in italy and turkey .
mehmet ali agca said he wants to travel to the vatican to visit the tomb of john paul ii and to meet with the current pontiff .
agca has announced he will sell the rights to his story so that it can be turned into a book and movie . he was a 23-year-old member of a militant far-right group when on may 13 , 1981 he opened fire on john paul ii in st. peter 's square in rome , seriously wounding the pope. ai / afp / ep editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the catholic leader previously said his visit would open a " new phase along the irrevocable path of agreement and friendship " between catholics and jews .
rome 's chief rabbi riccardo di segni said the move was a sign that the catholic church wanted to " continue the dialogue . "
jewish community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii is accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi persecution of jews but the visit came only four weeks after the german-born pontiff found himself at the center of a controversy that served rather to divide than bring together .
in december 2009 , a papal decree bestowed the title " venerable " on world war two-era pius xii , thus putting him one step closer to sainthood .
the decision had resulted in an outcry by critics and jewish communities around the world who accuse pius xii of having failed to speak out against the holocaust .
pius xii 's papacy ran from 1939 until 1958 .
ahead of the visit to the synagogue , the president of italy 's assembly of rabbis , giuseppe laras , announced he would not attend the event and criticised benedict for weakening the ties between the two religions .
laras said the pope failed to show an " understanding of the feelings of the jewish community . "
another controversial move by pope benedict xvi was the decision to speed rapprochement with a catholic fraternity that includes holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson .
benedict xvi is the second modern pope to visit the rome synagogue .
his predecessor john paul ii first visited the place of worship in 1986 and at the time had been warmly welcomed for his efforts to mend tensions between the two religions .
failed assassin to be released meanwhile , the man who tried to kill john paul ii in 1981 will be released on monday from prison after spending almost three decades behind bars in italy and turkey .
mehmet ali agca said he wants to travel to the vatican to visit the tomb of john paul ii and to meet with the current pontiff .
agca has announced he will sell the rights to his story so that it can be turned into a book and movie . he was a 23-year-old member of a militant far-right group when on may 13 , 1981 he opened fire on john paul ii in st. peter 's square in rome , seriously wounding the pope. ai / afp / ep editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu is increasingly worried about greece 's financial troubles affecting the stability of the euro currency .
next week , brussels is to vet athens ' crisis plan put forward to solve the country 's serious fiscal problems . greece is under mounting pressure from the eu to take drastic action to restore its public finances .
the country 's public spending deficit rose to 12.7 percent last year - far above the three percent permitted by the eurozone countries . the government in athens on thursday presented a crisis plan to get public spending back under control .
the three-year blueprint aims at bringing the public deficit to 8.7 percent in 2010 and eventually down to 2.8 percent by 2012 . the plan was submitted to eu on friday and next week will be examined by the eu commission . on monday , the eurozone 's economy ministers will meet while on thursday a meeting of all 27 eu economy ministers is scheduled . strong criticism from berlin the fiasco of greek 's public finances is putting a severe strain on the eurozone and has sparked a debate on whether athens could even be forced to abandon the single currency . german chancellor angela merkel broke from standard discourse this week when she pointed out her grave concerns over athens ' financial troubles .

the country 's powerful unions have already announced strikes to protest the measures . no special assistance luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker warned that " it would be false to let greece believe the other eurozone countries will help it resolve its problems . " in a similar vein , european central bank head jean-claude trichet told athens that help from the eu would be very limited . " no government , no state can expect from us any special treatment .
the problem is not to get help , the problem is to help oneself , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek pm papandreou was elected last october and inherited a huge budget deficit trichet , however dismissed the notion that greece could be forced out from the eurozone because of its debt crisis .

although details as to the exact nature of the complaint have not yet been released , the main concern is believed to revolve around " snippets " from media websites and news articles which show up in search results on google news . publishers say google has not paid for the use of these articles , and that regulations must be tightened to protect the authors from plagiarism .
the associations also say the way search results are currently listed is unfair .
in november , a bdzv official said his group wanted to know why some google news results were ranked higher than others .
google facing three complaints the vdz and bdzv 's concerns about google 's business practices are shared by shopping site , ciao , and map company , euro-cities .
ciao 's complaint is related to a contract about google 's automatic advertising system , adsense , which ciao signed before it was bought by microsoft .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- reported that ciao believes the contract to be overly restrictive , while not offering enough transparency on advertising revenues generated by adsense .
bildunterschrift : euro-cities says its business model is threatened by google maps euro-cities is unhappy with the fact that maps from google maps are being integrated on other internet sites for free , saying the practice is destroying its business model , the faz reported .
none of the complainants have officially commented on the issue .
euro-cities chief executive hans biermann said the parties agreed with the cartel office not to make the case fully public until january 20 .
google denies wrongdoing google 's german spokesman kay oberbeck says the company is confident it has done nothing wrong .
" we are very willing to explain our products and business practices to the cartel office and show that we are convinced these are in line with german and european law , " oberbeck said .
oberbeck added the company paid 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to publishers worldwide in 2009 .
in germany alone , google earns close to 1.2 billion euros a year on ads placed next to regular search results. mk / dc / dpa / apn editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german publisher associations have previously complained that google profits from their online content without offering them a fair share of advertising revenue .
although details as to the exact nature of the complaint have not yet been released , the main concern is believed to revolve around " snippets " from media websites and news articles which show up in search results on google news . publishers say google has not paid for the use of these articles , and that regulations must be tightened to protect the authors from plagiarism .
the associations also say the way search results are currently listed is unfair .
in november , a bdzv official said his group wanted to know why some google news results were ranked higher than others .
google facing three complaints the vdz and bdzv 's concerns about google 's business practices are shared by shopping site , ciao , and map company , euro-cities .
ciao 's complaint is related to a contract about google 's automatic advertising system , adsense , which ciao signed before it was bought by microsoft .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- reported that ciao believes the contract to be overly restrictive , while not offering enough transparency on advertising revenues generated by adsense .
bildunterschrift : euro-cities says its business model is threatened by google maps euro-cities is unhappy with the fact that maps from google maps are being integrated on other internet sites for free , saying the practice is destroying its business model , the faz reported .
none of the complainants have officially commented on the issue .
euro-cities chief executive hans biermann said the parties agreed with the cartel office not to make the case fully public until january 20 .
google denies wrongdoing google 's german spokesman kay oberbeck says the company is confident it has done nothing wrong .
" we are very willing to explain our products and business practices to the cartel office and show that we are convinced these are in line with german and european law , " oberbeck said .
oberbeck added the company paid 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to publishers worldwide in 2009 .
in germany alone , google earns close to 1.2 billion euros a year on ads placed next to regular search results. mk / dc / dpa / apn editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 17.01.2010 germany seeks bipartisan backing for afghan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that germany will increase its military contingent in afghanistan chancellor angela merkel is looking to cross party lines and consult with the opposition social democrats in order to secure the broadest parliamentary support for the german military 's unpopular mission to afghanistan . in an interview published on sunday , january 17 , with daily bild , german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said merkel 's government will be pushing for bipartisan support to continue german troop deployments in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is looking to gain support from her former coalition partner , the spd the chancellor is said to have already met with social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
local media reports say the two party leaders agreed to avoid any party bickering over the afghan mission .
since last year , steinmeier 's spd boosted criticism over the mission .
the fact that merkel is attempting to foster bipartisan support on this issue reduces the chances that germany will be increasing its military presence in afghanistan - despite being under pressure to join us president barack obama 's troop surge in the country .
the spd is opposed to sending more troops to the region .
instead , it would prefer to strengthen afghan security forces through education and training .
exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants to focus on training afghan security forces the spd has also made it clear that it wants to know exactly when german troops will be withdrawn from afghanistan .
spd chief sigmar gabriel said in recent weeks that the german military must begin withdrawals by 2011 .
" in the year that the united states begins to reduce its troop levels , that means germany must also start withdrawing in 2011 , " said gabriel in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" until then , germany has to train afghan police officers and soldiers much more quickly than before . "
under german law , foreign military deployments are only allowed after parliamentary approval for fixed periods .
guttenberg told bild that the widest parliamentary agreement on afghanistan " is important to ensure our soldiers have backing . "
rough deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz airstrike was a huge blow to german public opinion over the mission currently , germany has close to 4,400 troops stationed in northern afghanistan .
in recent months , the country 's deployment faced immense controversy over a german-ordered airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers in the city of kunduz in september , when up to 142 civilians are believed to have been killed .
the causalities made the already unpopular war even more unpopular among german citizens , and forced the defense minister at the time , franz josef jung , to resign .
meanwhile , german troops killed an afghan civilian on sunday , when two men approached a german checkpoint in a car at high speed .
the soldiers fired when the vehicle showed no signs of slowing down .
the german government is expected to wait until the end of january with its decision over troop activities and levels in afghanistan .

local media reports say the two party leaders agreed to avoid any party bickering over the afghan mission .
since last year , steinmeier 's spd boosted criticism over the mission .
the fact that merkel is attempting to foster bipartisan support on this issue reduces the chances that germany will be increasing its military presence in afghanistan - despite being under pressure to join us president barack obama 's troop surge in the country .
the spd is opposed to sending more troops to the region .

spd chief sigmar gabriel said in recent weeks that the german military must begin withdrawals by 2011 .
" in the year that the united states begins to reduce its troop levels , that means germany must also start withdrawing in 2011 , " said gabriel in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" until then , germany has to train afghan police officers and soldiers much more quickly than before . "
under german law , foreign military deployments are only allowed after parliamentary approval for fixed periods .
guttenberg told bild that the widest parliamentary agreement on afghanistan " is important to ensure our soldiers have backing . "
rough deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz airstrike was a huge blow to german public opinion over the mission currently , germany has close to 4,400 troops stationed in northern afghanistan .
in recent months , the country 's deployment faced immense controversy over a german-ordered airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers in the city of kunduz in september , when up to 142 civilians are believed to have been killed .
the causalities made the already unpopular war even more unpopular among german citizens , and forced the defense minister at the time , franz josef jung , to resign .
meanwhile , german troops killed an afghan civilian on sunday , when two men approached a german checkpoint in a car at high speed .
the soldiers fired when the vehicle showed no signs of slowing down .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is looking to gain support from her former coalition partner , the spd the chancellor is said to have already met with social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
local media reports say the two party leaders agreed to avoid any party bickering over the afghan mission .
since last year , steinmeier 's spd boosted criticism over the mission .
the fact that merkel is attempting to foster bipartisan support on this issue reduces the chances that germany will be increasing its military presence in afghanistan - despite being under pressure to join us president barack obama 's troop surge in the country .
the spd is opposed to sending more troops to the region .
instead , it would prefer to strengthen afghan security forces through education and training .
exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants to focus on training afghan security forces the spd has also made it clear that it wants to know exactly when german troops will be withdrawn from afghanistan .
spd chief sigmar gabriel said in recent weeks that the german military must begin withdrawals by 2011 .
" in the year that the united states begins to reduce its troop levels , that means germany must also start withdrawing in 2011 , " said gabriel in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" until then , germany has to train afghan police officers and soldiers much more quickly than before . "
under german law , foreign military deployments are only allowed after parliamentary approval for fixed periods .
guttenberg told bild that the widest parliamentary agreement on afghanistan " is important to ensure our soldiers have backing . "
rough deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz airstrike was a huge blow to german public opinion over the mission currently , germany has close to 4,400 troops stationed in northern afghanistan .
in recent months , the country 's deployment faced immense controversy over a german-ordered airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers in the city of kunduz in september , when up to 142 civilians are believed to have been killed .
the causalities made the already unpopular war even more unpopular among german citizens , and forced the defense minister at the time , franz josef jung , to resign .
meanwhile , german troops killed an afghan civilian on sunday , when two men approached a german checkpoint in a car at high speed .
the soldiers fired when the vehicle showed no signs of slowing down .
the german government is expected to wait until the end of january with its decision over troop activities and levels in afghanistan .

" the silence of pius xii before the shoah , still hurts because something should have been done , " said the president of rome 's jewish community , riccardo pacifici .
" maybe it would not have stopped the death trains , but it would have sent a signal , a word of extreme comfort , of human solidarity , towards those brothers of ours transported to the ovens of auschwitz , " he said .
pacifici urged the vatican to open its archives and give historians access to documents which would shed light on the actions of the wartime pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope hopes his visit would ease the tensions between catholics and jews benedict xvi , however , defended the vatican 's position that the church was acting behind the scenes to help jews .
" the apostolic see itself provided assistance , often in a hidden and discreet way , " the pope said in his speech at the synagogue .
as he started his landmark visit to rome 's main synagogue on sunday , january 17 , benedict xvi paid homage to more than 1,000 roman jews deported to nazi death camps .
the catholic leader previously said his visit would open a " new phase along the irrevocable path of agreement and friendship " between catholics and jews .
rome 's chief rabbi riccardo di segni said the move was a sign that the catholic church wanted to " continue the dialogue . "
jewish community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii is accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi persecution of jews but the visit came only four weeks after the german-born pontiff found himself at the center of a controversy that served rather to divide than bring together .
in december 2009 , a papal decree bestowed the title " venerable " on world war two-era pius xii , thus putting him one step closer to sainthood .
the decision had resulted in an outcry by critics and jewish communities around the world who accuse pius xii of having failed to speak out against the holocaust .
pius xii 's papacy ran from 1939 until 1958 .
ahead of the visit to the synagogue , the president of italy 's assembly of rabbis , giuseppe laras , announced he would not attend the event and criticised benedict for weakening the ties between the two religions .
laras said the pope failed to show an " understanding of the feelings of the jewish community . "
another controversial move by pope benedict xvi was the decision to speed rapprochement with a catholic fraternity that includes holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson .
benedict xvi is the second modern pope to visit the rome synagogue .
his predecessor john paul ii first visited the place of worship in 1986 and at the time had been warmly welcomed for his efforts to mend tensions between the two religions .
failed assassin to be released meanwhile , the man who tried to kill john paul ii in 1981 will be released on monday from prison after spending almost three decades behind bars in italy and turkey .
mehmet ali agca said he wants to travel to the vatican to visit the tomb of john paul ii and to meet with the current pontiff .
agca has announced he will sell the rights to his story so that it can be turned into a book and movie . he was a 23-year-old member of a militant far-right group when on may 13 , 1981 he opened fire on john paul ii in st. peter 's square in rome , seriously wounding the pope. ai / afp / ep editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the silence of pius xii before the shoah , still hurts because something should have been done , " said the president of rome 's jewish community , riccardo pacifici .
" maybe it would not have stopped the death trains , but it would have sent a signal , a word of extreme comfort , of human solidarity , towards those brothers of ours transported to the ovens of auschwitz , " he said .
pacifici urged the vatican to open its archives and give historians access to documents which would shed light on the actions of the wartime pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope hopes his visit would ease the tensions between catholics and jews benedict xvi , however , defended the vatican 's position that the church was acting behind the scenes to help jews .
" the apostolic see itself provided assistance , often in a hidden and discreet way , " the pope said in his speech at the synagogue .
as he started his landmark visit to rome 's main synagogue on sunday , january 17 , benedict xvi paid homage to more than 1,000 roman jews deported to nazi death camps .
the catholic leader previously said his visit would open a " new phase along the irrevocable path of agreement and friendship " between catholics and jews .
rome 's chief rabbi riccardo di segni said the move was a sign that the catholic church wanted to " continue the dialogue . "
jewish community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii is accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi persecution of jews but the visit came only four weeks after the german-born pontiff found himself at the center of a controversy that served rather to divide than bring together .
in december 2009 , a papal decree bestowed the title " venerable " on world war two-era pius xii , thus putting him one step closer to sainthood .
the decision had resulted in an outcry by critics and jewish communities around the world who accuse pius xii of having failed to speak out against the holocaust .
pius xii 's papacy ran from 1939 until 1958 .
ahead of the visit to the synagogue , the president of italy 's assembly of rabbis , giuseppe laras , announced he would not attend the event and criticised benedict for weakening the ties between the two religions .
laras said the pope failed to show an " understanding of the feelings of the jewish community . "
another controversial move by pope benedict xvi was the decision to speed rapprochement with a catholic fraternity that includes holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson .
benedict xvi is the second modern pope to visit the rome synagogue .
his predecessor john paul ii first visited the place of worship in 1986 and at the time had been warmly welcomed for his efforts to mend tensions between the two religions .
failed assassin to be released meanwhile , the man who tried to kill john paul ii in 1981 will be released on monday from prison after spending almost three decades behind bars in italy and turkey .
mehmet ali agca said he wants to travel to the vatican to visit the tomb of john paul ii and to meet with the current pontiff .
agca has announced he will sell the rights to his story so that it can be turned into a book and movie . he was a 23-year-old member of a militant far-right group when on may 13 , 1981 he opened fire on john paul ii in st. peter 's square in rome , seriously wounding the pope. ai / afp / ep editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu is increasingly worried about greece 's financial troubles affecting the stability of the euro currency .
next week , brussels is to vet athens ' crisis plan put forward to solve the country 's serious fiscal problems . greece is under mounting pressure from the eu to take drastic action to restore its public finances .
the country 's public spending deficit rose to 12.7 percent last year - far above the three percent permitted by the eurozone countries . the government in athens on thursday presented a crisis plan to get public spending back under control .
the three-year blueprint aims at bringing the public deficit to 8.7 percent in 2010 and eventually down to 2.8 percent by 2012 . the plan was submitted to eu on friday and next week will be examined by the eu commission . on monday , the eurozone 's economy ministers will meet while on thursday a meeting of all 27 eu economy ministers is scheduled . strong criticism from berlin the fiasco of greek 's public finances is putting a severe strain on the eurozone and has sparked a debate on whether athens could even be forced to abandon the single currency . german chancellor angela merkel broke from standard discourse this week when she pointed out her grave concerns over athens ' financial troubles .

" in a similar vein , european central bank head jean-claude trichet told athens that help from the eu would be very limited . " no government , no state can expect from us any special treatment .

" the silence of pius xii before the shoah , still hurts because something should have been done , " said the president of rome 's jewish community , riccardo pacifici .
" maybe it would not have stopped the death trains , but it would have sent a signal , a word of extreme comfort , of human solidarity , towards those brothers of ours transported to the ovens of auschwitz , " he said .
pacifici urged the vatican to open its archives and give historians access to documents which would shed light on the actions of the wartime pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope hopes his visit would ease the tensions between catholics and jews benedict xvi , however , defended the vatican 's position that the church was acting behind the scenes to help jews .
" the apostolic see itself provided assistance , often in a hidden and discreet way , " the pope said in his speech at the synagogue .
as he started his landmark visit to rome 's main synagogue on sunday , january 17 , benedict xvi paid homage to more than 1,000 roman jews deported to nazi death camps .
the catholic leader previously said his visit would open a " new phase along the irrevocable path of agreement and friendship " between catholics and jews .
rome 's chief rabbi riccardo di segni said the move was a sign that the catholic church wanted to " continue the dialogue . "
jewish community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii is accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi persecution of jews but the visit came only four weeks after the german-born pontiff found himself at the center of a controversy that served rather to divide than bring together .
in december 2009 , a papal decree bestowed the title " venerable " on world war two-era pius xii , thus putting him one step closer to sainthood .
the decision had resulted in an outcry by critics and jewish communities around the world who accuse pius xii of having failed to speak out against the holocaust .
pius xii 's papacy ran from 1939 until 1958 .
ahead of the visit to the synagogue , the president of italy 's assembly of rabbis , giuseppe laras , announced he would not attend the event and criticised benedict for weakening the ties between the two religions .
laras said the pope failed to show an " understanding of the feelings of the jewish community . "
another controversial move by pope benedict xvi was the decision to speed rapprochement with a catholic fraternity that includes holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson .
benedict xvi is the second modern pope to visit the rome synagogue .
his predecessor john paul ii first visited the place of worship in 1986 and at the time had been warmly welcomed for his efforts to mend tensions between the two religions .
failed assassin to be released meanwhile , the man who tried to kill john paul ii in 1981 will be released on monday from prison after spending almost three decades behind bars in italy and turkey .

the german publisher associations have previously complained that google profits from their online content without offering them a fair share of advertising revenue .
although details as to the exact nature of the complaint have not yet been released , the main concern is believed to revolve around " snippets " from media websites and news articles which show up in search results on google news . publishers say google has not paid for the use of these articles , and that regulations must be tightened to protect the authors from plagiarism .
the associations also say the way search results are currently listed is unfair .
in november , a bdzv official said his group wanted to know why some google news results were ranked higher than others .
google facing three complaints the vdz and bdzv 's concerns about google 's business practices are shared by shopping site , ciao , and map company , euro-cities .
ciao 's complaint is related to a contract about google 's automatic advertising system , adsense , which ciao signed before it was bought by microsoft .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- reported that ciao believes the contract to be overly restrictive , while not offering enough transparency on advertising revenues generated by adsense .
bildunterschrift : euro-cities says its business model is threatened by google maps euro-cities is unhappy with the fact that maps from google maps are being integrated on other internet sites for free , saying the practice is destroying its business model , the faz reported .
none of the complainants have officially commented on the issue .
euro-cities chief executive hans biermann said the parties agreed with the cartel office not to make the case fully public until january 20 .
google denies wrongdoing google 's german spokesman kay oberbeck says the company is confident it has done nothing wrong .
" we are very willing to explain our products and business practices to the cartel office and show that we are convinced these are in line with german and european law , " oberbeck said .
oberbeck added the company paid 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to publishers worldwide in 2009 .
in germany alone , google earns close to 1.2 billion euros a year on ads placed next to regular search results. mk / dc / dpa / apn editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the silence of pius xii before the shoah , still hurts because something should have been done , " said the president of rome 's jewish community , riccardo pacifici .
" maybe it would not have stopped the death trains , but it would have sent a signal , a word of extreme comfort , of human solidarity , towards those brothers of ours transported to the ovens of auschwitz , " he said .
pacifici urged the vatican to open its archives and give historians access to documents which would shed light on the actions of the wartime pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope hopes his visit would ease the tensions between catholics and jews benedict xvi , however , defended the vatican 's position that the church was acting behind the scenes to help jews .
" the apostolic see itself provided assistance , often in a hidden and discreet way , " the pope said in his speech at the synagogue .
as he started his landmark visit to rome 's main synagogue on sunday , january 17 , benedict xvi paid homage to more than 1,000 roman jews deported to nazi death camps .
the catholic leader previously said his visit would open a " new phase along the irrevocable path of agreement and friendship " between catholics and jews .
rome 's chief rabbi riccardo di segni said the move was a sign that the catholic church wanted to " continue the dialogue . "
jewish community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii is accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi persecution of jews but the visit came only four weeks after the german-born pontiff found himself at the center of a controversy that served rather to divide than bring together .
in december 2009 , a papal decree bestowed the title " venerable " on world war two-era pius xii , thus putting him one step closer to sainthood .
the decision had resulted in an outcry by critics and jewish communities around the world who accuse pius xii of having failed to speak out against the holocaust .
pius xii 's papacy ran from 1939 until 1958 .
ahead of the visit to the synagogue , the president of italy 's assembly of rabbis , giuseppe laras , announced he would not attend the event and criticised benedict for weakening the ties between the two religions .
laras said the pope failed to show an " understanding of the feelings of the jewish community . "
another controversial move by pope benedict xvi was the decision to speed rapprochement with a catholic fraternity that includes holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson .
benedict xvi is the second modern pope to visit the rome synagogue .
his predecessor john paul ii first visited the place of worship in 1986 and at the time had been warmly welcomed for his efforts to mend tensions between the two religions .
failed assassin to be released meanwhile , the man who tried to kill john paul ii in 1981 will be released on monday from prison after spending almost three decades behind bars in italy and turkey .
mehmet ali agca said he wants to travel to the vatican to visit the tomb of john paul ii and to meet with the current pontiff .
agca has announced he will sell the rights to his story so that it can be turned into a book and movie . he was a 23-year-old member of a militant far-right group when on may 13 , 1981 he opened fire on john paul ii in st. peter 's square in rome , seriously wounding the pope. ai / afp / ep editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as he started his landmark visit to rome 's main synagogue on sunday , january 17 , benedict xvi paid homage to more than 1,000 roman jews deported to nazi death camps .
the catholic leader previously said his visit would open a " new phase along the irrevocable path of agreement and friendship " between catholics and jews .
rome 's chief rabbi riccardo di segni said the move was a sign that the catholic church wanted to " continue the dialogue . "
jewish community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii is accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi persecution of jews but the visit came only four weeks after the german-born pontiff found himself at the center of a controversy that served rather to divide than bring together .
in december 2009 , a papal decree bestowed the title " venerable " on world war two-era pius xii , thus putting him one step closer to sainthood .
the decision had resulted in an outcry by critics and jewish communities around the world who accuse pius xii of having failed to speak out against the holocaust .
pius xii 's papacy ran from 1939 until 1958 .
ahead of the visit to the synagogue , the president of italy 's assembly of rabbis , giuseppe laras , announced he would not attend the event and criticised benedict for weakening the ties between the two religions .
laras said the pope failed to show an " understanding of the feelings of the jewish community . "
another controversial move by pope benedict xvi was the decision to speed rapprochement with a catholic fraternity that includes holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson .
benedict xvi is the second modern pope to visit the rome synagogue .
his predecessor john paul ii first visited the place of worship in 1986 and at the time had been warmly welcomed for his efforts to mend tensions between the two religions .
failed assassin to be released meanwhile , the man who tried to kill john paul ii in 1981 will be released on monday from prison after spending almost three decades behind bars in italy and turkey .
mehmet ali agca said he wants to travel to the vatican to visit the tomb of john paul ii and to meet with the current pontiff .
agca has announced he will sell the rights to his story so that it can be turned into a book and movie . he was a 23-year-old member of a militant far-right group when on may 13 , 1981 he opened fire on john paul ii in st. peter 's square in rome , seriously wounding the pope. ai / afp / ep editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german publisher associations have previously complained that google profits from their online content without offering them a fair share of advertising revenue .
although details as to the exact nature of the complaint have not yet been released , the main concern is believed to revolve around " snippets " from media websites and news articles which show up in search results on google news . publishers say google has not paid for the use of these articles , and that regulations must be tightened to protect the authors from plagiarism .
the associations also say the way search results are currently listed is unfair .
in november , a bdzv official said his group wanted to know why some google news results were ranked higher than others .
google facing three complaints the vdz and bdzv 's concerns about google 's business practices are shared by shopping site , ciao , and map company , euro-cities .
ciao 's complaint is related to a contract about google 's automatic advertising system , adsense , which ciao signed before it was bought by microsoft .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- reported that ciao believes the contract to be overly restrictive , while not offering enough transparency on advertising revenues generated by adsense .
bildunterschrift : euro-cities says its business model is threatened by google maps euro-cities is unhappy with the fact that maps from google maps are being integrated on other internet sites for free , saying the practice is destroying its business model , the faz reported .
none of the complainants have officially commented on the issue .
euro-cities chief executive hans biermann said the parties agreed with the cartel office not to make the case fully public until january 20 .
google denies wrongdoing google 's german spokesman kay oberbeck says the company is confident it has done nothing wrong .
" we are very willing to explain our products and business practices to the cartel office and show that we are convinced these are in line with german and european law , " oberbeck said .
oberbeck added the company paid 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to publishers worldwide in 2009 .
in germany alone , google earns close to 1.2 billion euros a year on ads placed next to regular search results. mk / dc / dpa / apn editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the silence of pius xii before the shoah , still hurts because something should have been done , " said the president of rome 's jewish community , riccardo pacifici .
" maybe it would not have stopped the death trains , but it would have sent a signal , a word of extreme comfort , of human solidarity , towards those brothers of ours transported to the ovens of auschwitz , " he said .
pacifici urged the vatican to open its archives and give historians access to documents which would shed light on the actions of the wartime pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope hopes his visit would ease the tensions between catholics and jews benedict xvi , however , defended the vatican 's position that the church was acting behind the scenes to help jews .
" the apostolic see itself provided assistance , often in a hidden and discreet way , " the pope said in his speech at the synagogue .
as he started his landmark visit to rome 's main synagogue on sunday , january 17 , benedict xvi paid homage to more than 1,000 roman jews deported to nazi death camps .
the catholic leader previously said his visit would open a " new phase along the irrevocable path of agreement and friendship " between catholics and jews .
rome 's chief rabbi riccardo di segni said the move was a sign that the catholic church wanted to " continue the dialogue . "
jewish community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii is accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi persecution of jews but the visit came only four weeks after the german-born pontiff found himself at the center of a controversy that served rather to divide than bring together .
in december 2009 , a papal decree bestowed the title " venerable " on world war two-era pius xii , thus putting him one step closer to sainthood .
the decision had resulted in an outcry by critics and jewish communities around the world who accuse pius xii of having failed to speak out against the holocaust .
pius xii 's papacy ran from 1939 until 1958 .
ahead of the visit to the synagogue , the president of italy 's assembly of rabbis , giuseppe laras , announced he would not attend the event and criticised benedict for weakening the ties between the two religions .
laras said the pope failed to show an " understanding of the feelings of the jewish community . "
another controversial move by pope benedict xvi was the decision to speed rapprochement with a catholic fraternity that includes holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson .
benedict xvi is the second modern pope to visit the rome synagogue .
his predecessor john paul ii first visited the place of worship in 1986 and at the time had been warmly welcomed for his efforts to mend tensions between the two religions .
failed assassin to be released meanwhile , the man who tried to kill john paul ii in 1981 will be released on monday from prison after spending almost three decades behind bars in italy and turkey .
mehmet ali agca said he wants to travel to the vatican to visit the tomb of john paul ii and to meet with the current pontiff .
agca has announced he will sell the rights to his story so that it can be turned into a book and movie . he was a 23-year-old member of a militant far-right group when on may 13 , 1981 he opened fire on john paul ii in st. peter 's square in rome , seriously wounding the pope. ai / afp / ep editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the silence of pius xii before the shoah , still hurts because something should have been done , " said the president of rome 's jewish community , riccardo pacifici .
" maybe it would not have stopped the death trains , but it would have sent a signal , a word of extreme comfort , of human solidarity , towards those brothers of ours transported to the ovens of auschwitz , " he said .
pacifici urged the vatican to open its archives and give historians access to documents which would shed light on the actions of the wartime pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope hopes his visit would ease the tensions between catholics and jews benedict xvi , however , defended the vatican 's position that the church was acting behind the scenes to help jews .
" the apostolic see itself provided assistance , often in a hidden and discreet way , " the pope said in his speech at the synagogue .
as he started his landmark visit to rome 's main synagogue on sunday , january 17 , benedict xvi paid homage to more than 1,000 roman jews deported to nazi death camps .
the catholic leader previously said his visit would open a " new phase along the irrevocable path of agreement and friendship " between catholics and jews .
rome 's chief rabbi riccardo di segni said the move was a sign that the catholic church wanted to " continue the dialogue . "
jewish community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii is accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi persecution of jews but the visit came only four weeks after the german-born pontiff found himself at the center of a controversy that served rather to divide than bring together .
in december 2009 , a papal decree bestowed the title " venerable " on world war two-era pius xii , thus putting him one step closer to sainthood .
the decision had resulted in an outcry by critics and jewish communities around the world who accuse pius xii of having failed to speak out against the holocaust .
pius xii 's papacy ran from 1939 until 1958 .
ahead of the visit to the synagogue , the president of italy 's assembly of rabbis , giuseppe laras , announced he would not attend the event and criticised benedict for weakening the ties between the two religions .
laras said the pope failed to show an " understanding of the feelings of the jewish community . "
another controversial move by pope benedict xvi was the decision to speed rapprochement with a catholic fraternity that includes holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson .
benedict xvi is the second modern pope to visit the rome synagogue .
his predecessor john paul ii first visited the place of worship in 1986 and at the time had been warmly welcomed for his efforts to mend tensions between the two religions .
failed assassin to be released meanwhile , the man who tried to kill john paul ii in 1981 will be released on monday from prison after spending almost three decades behind bars in italy and turkey .
mehmet ali agca said he wants to travel to the vatican to visit the tomb of john paul ii and to meet with the current pontiff .
agca has announced he will sell the rights to his story so that it can be turned into a book and movie . he was a 23-year-old member of a militant far-right group when on may 13 , 1981 he opened fire on john paul ii in st. peter 's square in rome , seriously wounding the pope. ai / afp / ep editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although details as to the exact nature of the complaint have not yet been released , the main concern is believed to revolve around " snippets " from media websites and news articles which show up in search results on google news . publishers say google has not paid for the use of these articles , and that regulations must be tightened to protect the authors from plagiarism .
the associations also say the way search results are currently listed is unfair .
in november , a bdzv official said his group wanted to know why some google news results were ranked higher than others .
google facing three complaints the vdz and bdzv 's concerns about google 's business practices are shared by shopping site , ciao , and map company , euro-cities .
ciao 's complaint is related to a contract about google 's automatic advertising system , adsense , which ciao signed before it was bought by microsoft .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- reported that ciao believes the contract to be overly restrictive , while not offering enough transparency on advertising revenues generated by adsense .
bildunterschrift : euro-cities says its business model is threatened by google maps euro-cities is unhappy with the fact that maps from google maps are being integrated on other internet sites for free , saying the practice is destroying its business model , the faz reported .
none of the complainants have officially commented on the issue .
euro-cities chief executive hans biermann said the parties agreed with the cartel office not to make the case fully public until january 20 .
google denies wrongdoing google 's german spokesman kay oberbeck says the company is confident it has done nothing wrong .
" we are very willing to explain our products and business practices to the cartel office and show that we are convinced these are in line with german and european law , " oberbeck said .
oberbeck added the company paid 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to publishers worldwide in 2009 .
in germany alone , google earns close to 1.2 billion euros a year on ads placed next to regular search results. mk / dc / dpa / apn editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu is increasingly worried about greece 's financial troubles affecting the stability of the euro currency .
next week , brussels is to vet athens ' crisis plan put forward to solve the country 's serious fiscal problems . greece is under mounting pressure from the eu to take drastic action to restore its public finances .
the country 's public spending deficit rose to 12.7 percent last year - far above the three percent permitted by the eurozone countries . the government in athens on thursday presented a crisis plan to get public spending back under control .
the three-year blueprint aims at bringing the public deficit to 8.7 percent in 2010 and eventually down to 2.8 percent by 2012 . the plan was submitted to eu on friday and next week will be examined by the eu commission . on monday , the eurozone 's economy ministers will meet while on thursday a meeting of all 27 eu economy ministers is scheduled . strong criticism from berlin the fiasco of greek 's public finances is putting a severe strain on the eurozone and has sparked a debate on whether athens could even be forced to abandon the single currency . german chancellor angela merkel broke from standard discourse this week when she pointed out her grave concerns over athens ' financial troubles . " the greece example is putting us under great , great pressure , " she said .
" the euro is in a very difficult phase for the coming years . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel was unusually frank in her comments about greece merkel subsequently was quick to say she did n't mean any direct criticism , but her somber tone expressed a concern shared by many of her colleagues across europe . there are worries that athens ' fiscal problems could threaten the credibility of the eurozone and could be a precursor to similar debt crises in weaker european economies . greece 's credit rating has been downgraded by all major international rating agencies and financial analysts have cast doubt on whether athens will be able to implement its rigorous austerity plan .
the country 's powerful unions have already announced strikes to protest the measures . no special assistance luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker warned that " it would be false to let greece believe the other eurozone countries will help it resolve its problems . " in a similar vein , european central bank head jean-claude trichet told athens that help from the eu would be very limited . " no government , no state can expect from us any special treatment .
the problem is not to get help , the problem is to help oneself , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek pm papandreou was elected last october and inherited a huge budget deficit trichet , however dismissed the notion that greece could be forced out from the eurozone because of its debt crisis .
he described suggestions that athens might resign or be expelled as an " absurd hypothesis . " the european commission is expected to give its verdict on the greek crisis plan by late january and will then forward it to the bloc 's economy commissioner , who will have to give the final approval . the greek plan promises to cut welfare spending , reform taxation , battle tax evasion and save on public sector wages . " we will achieve fiscal consolidation within three years , we will do everything it takes for this , " greek prime minister george papandreou said , expressing his confidence when presenting the plan to parliament .
" we can do it , this target is feasible . " ai / dpa / afp editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is looking to gain support from her former coalition partner , the spd the chancellor is said to have already met with social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
local media reports say the two party leaders agreed to avoid any party bickering over the afghan mission .
since last year , steinmeier 's spd boosted criticism over the mission .
the fact that merkel is attempting to foster bipartisan support on this issue reduces the chances that germany will be increasing its military presence in afghanistan - despite being under pressure to join us president barack obama 's troop surge in the country .
the spd is opposed to sending more troops to the region .
instead , it would prefer to strengthen afghan security forces through education and training .

spd chief sigmar gabriel said in recent weeks that the german military must begin withdrawals by 2011 .
" in the year that the united states begins to reduce its troop levels , that means germany must also start withdrawing in 2011 , " said gabriel in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" until then , germany has to train afghan police officers and soldiers much more quickly than before . "
under german law , foreign military deployments are only allowed after parliamentary approval for fixed periods .
guttenberg told bild that the widest parliamentary agreement on afghanistan " is important to ensure our soldiers have backing . "

in recent months , the country 's deployment faced immense controversy over a german-ordered airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers in the city of kunduz in september , when up to 142 civilians are believed to have been killed .
the causalities made the already unpopular war even more unpopular among german citizens , and forced the defense minister at the time , franz josef jung , to resign .
meanwhile , german troops killed an afghan civilian on sunday , when two men approached a german checkpoint in a car at high speed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 17.01.2010 germany seeks bipartisan backing for afghan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that germany will increase its military contingent in afghanistan chancellor angela merkel is looking to cross party lines and consult with the opposition social democrats in order to secure the broadest parliamentary support for the german military 's unpopular mission to afghanistan . in an interview published on sunday , january 17 , with daily bild , german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said merkel 's government will be pushing for bipartisan support to continue german troop deployments in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is looking to gain support from her former coalition partner , the spd the chancellor is said to have already met with social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
local media reports say the two party leaders agreed to avoid any party bickering over the afghan mission .
since last year , steinmeier 's spd boosted criticism over the mission .
the fact that merkel is attempting to foster bipartisan support on this issue reduces the chances that germany will be increasing its military presence in afghanistan - despite being under pressure to join us president barack obama 's troop surge in the country .
the spd is opposed to sending more troops to the region .
instead , it would prefer to strengthen afghan security forces through education and training .
exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants to focus on training afghan security forces the spd has also made it clear that it wants to know exactly when german troops will be withdrawn from afghanistan .
spd chief sigmar gabriel said in recent weeks that the german military must begin withdrawals by 2011 .
" in the year that the united states begins to reduce its troop levels , that means germany must also start withdrawing in 2011 , " said gabriel in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" until then , germany has to train afghan police officers and soldiers much more quickly than before . "
under german law , foreign military deployments are only allowed after parliamentary approval for fixed periods .
guttenberg told bild that the widest parliamentary agreement on afghanistan " is important to ensure our soldiers have backing . "
rough deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz airstrike was a huge blow to german public opinion over the mission currently , germany has close to 4,400 troops stationed in northern afghanistan .
in recent months , the country 's deployment faced immense controversy over a german-ordered airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers in the city of kunduz in september , when up to 142 civilians are believed to have been killed .
the causalities made the already unpopular war even more unpopular among german citizens , and forced the defense minister at the time , franz josef jung , to resign .
meanwhile , german troops killed an afghan civilian on sunday , when two men approached a german checkpoint in a car at high speed .
the soldiers fired when the vehicle showed no signs of slowing down .
the german government is expected to wait until the end of january with its decision over troop activities and levels in afghanistan .

the eu is increasingly worried about greece 's financial troubles affecting the stability of the euro currency .
next week , brussels is to vet athens ' crisis plan put forward to solve the country 's serious fiscal problems . greece is under mounting pressure from the eu to take drastic action to restore its public finances .
the country 's public spending deficit rose to 12.7 percent last year - far above the three percent permitted by the eurozone countries . the government in athens on thursday presented a crisis plan to get public spending back under control .
the three-year blueprint aims at bringing the public deficit to 8.7 percent in 2010 and eventually down to 2.8 percent by 2012 . the plan was submitted to eu on friday and next week will be examined by the eu commission . on monday , the eurozone 's economy ministers will meet while on thursday a meeting of all 27 eu economy ministers is scheduled . strong criticism from berlin the fiasco of greek 's public finances is putting a severe strain on the eurozone and has sparked a debate on whether athens could even be forced to abandon the single currency . german chancellor angela merkel broke from standard discourse this week when she pointed out her grave concerns over athens ' financial troubles . " the greece example is putting us under great , great pressure , " she said .
" the euro is in a very difficult phase for the coming years . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel was unusually frank in her comments about greece merkel subsequently was quick to say she did n't mean any direct criticism , but her somber tone expressed a concern shared by many of her colleagues across europe . there are worries that athens ' fiscal problems could threaten the credibility of the eurozone and could be a precursor to similar debt crises in weaker european economies . greece 's credit rating has been downgraded by all major international rating agencies and financial analysts have cast doubt on whether athens will be able to implement its rigorous austerity plan .
the country 's powerful unions have already announced strikes to protest the measures . no special assistance luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker warned that " it would be false to let greece believe the other eurozone countries will help it resolve its problems . " in a similar vein , european central bank head jean-claude trichet told athens that help from the eu would be very limited . " no government , no state can expect from us any special treatment .
the problem is not to get help , the problem is to help oneself , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek pm papandreou was elected last october and inherited a huge budget deficit trichet , however dismissed the notion that greece could be forced out from the eurozone because of its debt crisis .
he described suggestions that athens might resign or be expelled as an " absurd hypothesis . " the european commission is expected to give its verdict on the greek crisis plan by late january and will then forward it to the bloc 's economy commissioner , who will have to give the final approval . the greek plan promises to cut welfare spending , reform taxation , battle tax evasion and save on public sector wages . " we will achieve fiscal consolidation within three years , we will do everything it takes for this , " greek prime minister george papandreou said , expressing his confidence when presenting the plan to parliament .

the eu is increasingly worried about greece 's financial troubles affecting the stability of the euro currency .
next week , brussels is to vet athens ' crisis plan put forward to solve the country 's serious fiscal problems . greece is under mounting pressure from the eu to take drastic action to restore its public finances .
the country 's public spending deficit rose to 12.7 percent last year - far above the three percent permitted by the eurozone countries . the government in athens on thursday presented a crisis plan to get public spending back under control .
the three-year blueprint aims at bringing the public deficit to 8.7 percent in 2010 and eventually down to 2.8 percent by 2012 . the plan was submitted to eu on friday and next week will be examined by the eu commission . on monday , the eurozone 's economy ministers will meet while on thursday a meeting of all 27 eu economy ministers is scheduled . strong criticism from berlin the fiasco of greek 's public finances is putting a severe strain on the eurozone and has sparked a debate on whether athens could even be forced to abandon the single currency . german chancellor angela merkel broke from standard discourse this week when she pointed out her grave concerns over athens ' financial troubles .

" in a similar vein , european central bank head jean-claude trichet told athens that help from the eu would be very limited . " no government , no state can expect from us any special treatment .
the problem is not to get help , the problem is to help oneself , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek pm papandreou was elected last october and inherited a huge budget deficit trichet , however dismissed the notion that greece could be forced out from the eurozone because of its debt crisis .

" merkel 's coalition government has hit a rocky terrain in the past few months , as internal arguments have sprung up over issues such as tax policy , turkey 's bid to become an eu member , and the afghan mission .

the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are in favor of a plan to allow deep tax breaks , with westerwelle saying it is " absolutely the core priority " for his party . the recession has dealt a huge blow to the federal budget , and the government says it will have to add a record 85.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 123.4 billion -rrb- in new debt this year . however , even some of merkel 's own christian democrats as well as state and local leaders are opposed to the idea , saying a tax giveaway would only add to the already extremely large debt the government is currently facing . a survey done by german daily bild showed 57 percent of voters expected the coalition to go ahead with the tax cuts despite the negative state of public finances . merkel 's image hurting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the in-fighting has lowered merkel 's popularity among germans the recent in-fighting between the ruling coalition parties has taken a toll on the government 's public image .
a recent survey by the forsa institute showed that opposition parties actually had higher support than the coalition for the first time since the merkel started her second term . as for merkel herself , a dimap survey in early january showed public satisfaction with merkel 's job performance went down 11 points from the previous month , bringing it to 59 percent . another survey showed 52 percent of voters felt merkel was not doing enough to set a direct course of action for the government . mk / afp / ap / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" merkel 's coalition government has hit a rocky terrain in the past few months , as internal arguments have sprung up over issues such as tax policy , turkey 's bid to become an eu member , and the afghan mission . " the new coalition has got off to a very poor start , especially in tax questions , " said gerd langguth , a professor of political science at bonn university . tax breaks controversial bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members within merkel 's own party oppose the tax cut plan at the heart of the internal dispute between coalition members is the question of proposed tax breaks for german citizens .
the business-friendly free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- are in favor of a plan to allow deep tax breaks , with westerwelle saying it is " absolutely the core priority " for his party . the recession has dealt a huge blow to the federal budget , and the government says it will have to add a record 85.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 123.4 billion -rrb- in new debt this year . however , even some of merkel 's own christian democrats as well as state and local leaders are opposed to the idea , saying a tax giveaway would only add to the already extremely large debt the government is currently facing . a survey done by german daily bild showed 57 percent of voters expected the coalition to go ahead with the tax cuts despite the negative state of public finances . merkel 's image hurting bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the in-fighting has lowered merkel 's popularity among germans the recent in-fighting between the ruling coalition parties has taken a toll on the government 's public image .
a recent survey by the forsa institute showed that opposition parties actually had higher support than the coalition for the first time since the merkel started her second term . as for merkel herself , a dimap survey in early january showed public satisfaction with merkel 's job performance went down 11 points from the previous month , bringing it to 59 percent . another survey showed 52 percent of voters felt merkel was not doing enough to set a direct course of action for the government . mk / afp / ap / dpa editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the silence of pius xii before the shoah , still hurts because something should have been done , " said the president of rome 's jewish community , riccardo pacifici .
" maybe it would not have stopped the death trains , but it would have sent a signal , a word of extreme comfort , of human solidarity , towards those brothers of ours transported to the ovens of auschwitz , " he said .
pacifici urged the vatican to open its archives and give historians access to documents which would shed light on the actions of the wartime pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope hopes his visit would ease the tensions between catholics and jews benedict xvi , however , defended the vatican 's position that the church was acting behind the scenes to help jews .
" the apostolic see itself provided assistance , often in a hidden and discreet way , " the pope said in his speech at the synagogue .
as he started his landmark visit to rome 's main synagogue on sunday , january 17 , benedict xvi paid homage to more than 1,000 roman jews deported to nazi death camps .
the catholic leader previously said his visit would open a " new phase along the irrevocable path of agreement and friendship " between catholics and jews .
rome 's chief rabbi riccardo di segni said the move was a sign that the catholic church wanted to " continue the dialogue . "
jewish community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii is accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi persecution of jews but the visit came only four weeks after the german-born pontiff found himself at the center of a controversy that served rather to divide than bring together .
in december 2009 , a papal decree bestowed the title " venerable " on world war two-era pius xii , thus putting him one step closer to sainthood .
the decision had resulted in an outcry by critics and jewish communities around the world who accuse pius xii of having failed to speak out against the holocaust .
pius xii 's papacy ran from 1939 until 1958 .
ahead of the visit to the synagogue , the president of italy 's assembly of rabbis , giuseppe laras , announced he would not attend the event and criticised benedict for weakening the ties between the two religions .
laras said the pope failed to show an " understanding of the feelings of the jewish community . "
another controversial move by pope benedict xvi was the decision to speed rapprochement with a catholic fraternity that includes holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson .
benedict xvi is the second modern pope to visit the rome synagogue .
his predecessor john paul ii first visited the place of worship in 1986 and at the time had been warmly welcomed for his efforts to mend tensions between the two religions .
failed assassin to be released meanwhile , the man who tried to kill john paul ii in 1981 will be released on monday from prison after spending almost three decades behind bars in italy and turkey .
mehmet ali agca said he wants to travel to the vatican to visit the tomb of john paul ii and to meet with the current pontiff .
agca has announced he will sell the rights to his story so that it can be turned into a book and movie . he was a 23-year-old member of a militant far-right group when on may 13 , 1981 he opened fire on john paul ii in st. peter 's square in rome , seriously wounding the pope. ai / afp / ep editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the silence of pius xii before the shoah , still hurts because something should have been done , " said the president of rome 's jewish community , riccardo pacifici .
" maybe it would not have stopped the death trains , but it would have sent a signal , a word of extreme comfort , of human solidarity , towards those brothers of ours transported to the ovens of auschwitz , " he said .
pacifici urged the vatican to open its archives and give historians access to documents which would shed light on the actions of the wartime pontiff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope hopes his visit would ease the tensions between catholics and jews benedict xvi , however , defended the vatican 's position that the church was acting behind the scenes to help jews .
" the apostolic see itself provided assistance , often in a hidden and discreet way , " the pope said in his speech at the synagogue .
as he started his landmark visit to rome 's main synagogue on sunday , january 17 , benedict xvi paid homage to more than 1,000 roman jews deported to nazi death camps .
the catholic leader previously said his visit would open a " new phase along the irrevocable path of agreement and friendship " between catholics and jews .
rome 's chief rabbi riccardo di segni said the move was a sign that the catholic church wanted to " continue the dialogue . "
jewish community divided bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope pius xii is accused of turning a blind eye to the nazi persecution of jews but the visit came only four weeks after the german-born pontiff found himself at the center of a controversy that served rather to divide than bring together .
in december 2009 , a papal decree bestowed the title " venerable " on world war two-era pius xii , thus putting him one step closer to sainthood .
the decision had resulted in an outcry by critics and jewish communities around the world who accuse pius xii of having failed to speak out against the holocaust .
pius xii 's papacy ran from 1939 until 1958 .
ahead of the visit to the synagogue , the president of italy 's assembly of rabbis , giuseppe laras , announced he would not attend the event and criticised benedict for weakening the ties between the two religions .
laras said the pope failed to show an " understanding of the feelings of the jewish community . "
another controversial move by pope benedict xvi was the decision to speed rapprochement with a catholic fraternity that includes holocaust-denying bishop richard williamson .
benedict xvi is the second modern pope to visit the rome synagogue .
his predecessor john paul ii first visited the place of worship in 1986 and at the time had been warmly welcomed for his efforts to mend tensions between the two religions .
failed assassin to be released meanwhile , the man who tried to kill john paul ii in 1981 will be released on monday from prison after spending almost three decades behind bars in italy and turkey .
mehmet ali agca said he wants to travel to the vatican to visit the tomb of john paul ii and to meet with the current pontiff .
agca has announced he will sell the rights to his story so that it can be turned into a book and movie . he was a 23-year-old member of a militant far-right group when on may 13 , 1981 he opened fire on john paul ii in st. peter 's square in rome , seriously wounding the pope. ai / afp / ep editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 17.01.2010 germany seeks bipartisan backing for afghan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is unlikely that germany will increase its military contingent in afghanistan chancellor angela merkel is looking to cross party lines and consult with the opposition social democrats in order to secure the broadest parliamentary support for the german military 's unpopular mission to afghanistan . in an interview published on sunday , january 17 , with daily bild , german defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg said merkel 's government will be pushing for bipartisan support to continue german troop deployments in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is looking to gain support from her former coalition partner , the spd the chancellor is said to have already met with social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
local media reports say the two party leaders agreed to avoid any party bickering over the afghan mission .
since last year , steinmeier 's spd boosted criticism over the mission .
the fact that merkel is attempting to foster bipartisan support on this issue reduces the chances that germany will be increasing its military presence in afghanistan - despite being under pressure to join us president barack obama 's troop surge in the country .
the spd is opposed to sending more troops to the region .
instead , it would prefer to strengthen afghan security forces through education and training .
exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants to focus on training afghan security forces the spd has also made it clear that it wants to know exactly when german troops will be withdrawn from afghanistan .
spd chief sigmar gabriel said in recent weeks that the german military must begin withdrawals by 2011 .
" in the year that the united states begins to reduce its troop levels , that means germany must also start withdrawing in 2011 , " said gabriel in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" until then , germany has to train afghan police officers and soldiers much more quickly than before . "
under german law , foreign military deployments are only allowed after parliamentary approval for fixed periods .
guttenberg told bild that the widest parliamentary agreement on afghanistan " is important to ensure our soldiers have backing . "
rough deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz airstrike was a huge blow to german public opinion over the mission currently , germany has close to 4,400 troops stationed in northern afghanistan .
in recent months , the country 's deployment faced immense controversy over a german-ordered airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers in the city of kunduz in september , when up to 142 civilians are believed to have been killed .
the causalities made the already unpopular war even more unpopular among german citizens , and forced the defense minister at the time , franz josef jung , to resign .
meanwhile , german troops killed an afghan civilian on sunday , when two men approached a german checkpoint in a car at high speed .
the soldiers fired when the vehicle showed no signs of slowing down .
the german government is expected to wait until the end of january with its decision over troop activities and levels in afghanistan .

the german publisher associations have previously complained that google profits from their online content without offering them a fair share of advertising revenue .
although details as to the exact nature of the complaint have not yet been released , the main concern is believed to revolve around " snippets " from media websites and news articles which show up in search results on google news . publishers say google has not paid for the use of these articles , and that regulations must be tightened to protect the authors from plagiarism .
the associations also say the way search results are currently listed is unfair .
in november , a bdzv official said his group wanted to know why some google news results were ranked higher than others .
google facing three complaints the vdz and bdzv 's concerns about google 's business practices are shared by shopping site , ciao , and map company , euro-cities .
ciao 's complaint is related to a contract about google 's automatic advertising system , adsense , which ciao signed before it was bought by microsoft .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- reported that ciao believes the contract to be overly restrictive , while not offering enough transparency on advertising revenues generated by adsense .
bildunterschrift : euro-cities says its business model is threatened by google maps euro-cities is unhappy with the fact that maps from google maps are being integrated on other internet sites for free , saying the practice is destroying its business model , the faz reported .
none of the complainants have officially commented on the issue .
euro-cities chief executive hans biermann said the parties agreed with the cartel office not to make the case fully public until january 20 .
google denies wrongdoing google 's german spokesman kay oberbeck says the company is confident it has done nothing wrong .
" we are very willing to explain our products and business practices to the cartel office and show that we are convinced these are in line with german and european law , " oberbeck said .
oberbeck added the company paid 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to publishers worldwide in 2009 .
in germany alone , google earns close to 1.2 billion euros a year on ads placed next to regular search results. mk / dc / dpa / apn editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is looking to gain support from her former coalition partner , the spd the chancellor is said to have already met with social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
local media reports say the two party leaders agreed to avoid any party bickering over the afghan mission .
since last year , steinmeier 's spd boosted criticism over the mission .
the fact that merkel is attempting to foster bipartisan support on this issue reduces the chances that germany will be increasing its military presence in afghanistan - despite being under pressure to join us president barack obama 's troop surge in the country .
the spd is opposed to sending more troops to the region .
instead , it would prefer to strengthen afghan security forces through education and training .
exit strategy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd wants to focus on training afghan security forces the spd has also made it clear that it wants to know exactly when german troops will be withdrawn from afghanistan .
spd chief sigmar gabriel said in recent weeks that the german military must begin withdrawals by 2011 .
" in the year that the united states begins to reduce its troop levels , that means germany must also start withdrawing in 2011 , " said gabriel in an interview with german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" until then , germany has to train afghan police officers and soldiers much more quickly than before . "
under german law , foreign military deployments are only allowed after parliamentary approval for fixed periods .
guttenberg told bild that the widest parliamentary agreement on afghanistan " is important to ensure our soldiers have backing . "
rough deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kunduz airstrike was a huge blow to german public opinion over the mission currently , germany has close to 4,400 troops stationed in northern afghanistan .
in recent months , the country 's deployment faced immense controversy over a german-ordered airstrike on two hijacked fuel tankers in the city of kunduz in september , when up to 142 civilians are believed to have been killed .
the causalities made the already unpopular war even more unpopular among german citizens , and forced the defense minister at the time , franz josef jung , to resign .
meanwhile , german troops killed an afghan civilian on sunday , when two men approached a german checkpoint in a car at high speed .
the soldiers fired when the vehicle showed no signs of slowing down .
the german government is expected to wait until the end of january with its decision over troop activities and levels in afghanistan .

the german publisher associations have previously complained that google profits from their online content without offering them a fair share of advertising revenue .
although details as to the exact nature of the complaint have not yet been released , the main concern is believed to revolve around " snippets " from media websites and news articles which show up in search results on google news . publishers say google has not paid for the use of these articles , and that regulations must be tightened to protect the authors from plagiarism .
the associations also say the way search results are currently listed is unfair .
in november , a bdzv official said his group wanted to know why some google news results were ranked higher than others .
google facing three complaints the vdz and bdzv 's concerns about google 's business practices are shared by shopping site , ciao , and map company , euro-cities .
ciao 's complaint is related to a contract about google 's automatic advertising system , adsense , which ciao signed before it was bought by microsoft .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- reported that ciao believes the contract to be overly restrictive , while not offering enough transparency on advertising revenues generated by adsense .
bildunterschrift : euro-cities says its business model is threatened by google maps euro-cities is unhappy with the fact that maps from google maps are being integrated on other internet sites for free , saying the practice is destroying its business model , the faz reported .
none of the complainants have officially commented on the issue .
euro-cities chief executive hans biermann said the parties agreed with the cartel office not to make the case fully public until january 20 .
google denies wrongdoing google 's german spokesman kay oberbeck says the company is confident it has done nothing wrong .
" we are very willing to explain our products and business practices to the cartel office and show that we are convinced these are in line with german and european law , " oberbeck said .
oberbeck added the company paid 4.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- to publishers worldwide in 2009 .
in germany alone , google earns close to 1.2 billion euros a year on ads placed next to regular search results. mk / dc / dpa / apn editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
