superior strategic calls early on helped mercedes ' nico rosberg claim third place . jenson button has won his second race of the 2010 formula one season , coming from fifth on the grid in difficult , changeable weather conditions .
as in australia earlier this year , button 's victory was partly thanks to him keeping cool in the treacherous weather and being on the right kind of tires at the right time .
button - who many believed could struggle in his new mercedes-powered mclaren against the highly-fancied 2008 champion lewis hamilton - is now ten points clear of the pack in the overall driver 's standings , having led the field all season long last year .
" this win is something very special , and it really means a lot to me , " button said in the post-race press conference .

the maltese men who claimed they were abused by priests while living in an orphanage had requested a private meeting with the pope .
earlier on sunday , his second day in malta , the pope celebrated an open air mass in malta 's biggest square .
church officials estimated up to 10,000 people attended despite heavy rain showers . during his addresss , benedict praised malta 's opposition to divorce and urged followers in the heavily catholic nation to uphold their faith .
" at every moment of our lives we depend entirely on god , " the pope told those gathered .
no comment until the meeting with the abuse victims , the pontiff had not commented directly on the allegations that the church covered up for priests who molested minors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch has said that the german church stands behind the pope " these meetings are never announced beforehand , " the pope 's spokesman , federico lombardi , told reporters .
but malta 's top archbishop , paul cremona , was more critical . " we can not just cling to the model of the church to which we have been accustomed for decades , " cremona said as he opened the papal mass .
he did not directly mention the scandal but said the " church must be humble enough to recognize the failures and sins of its members . "
top german bishop supports pope but a top bishop in benedict 's native germany offered benedikt his " unreserved solidarity " as the pontiff marks the fifth anniversary of his election .
archbishop robert zollitsch , the head of the german bishops ' conference , wrote in a congratulatory letter that the pope could rely on the german church 's " full support . "
the pope is expected to hold a meeting with thousands of young catholics and take a harbor ride before returning to rome on sunday evening. smh / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the memorial for the four germans killed last thursday in a rocket attack was held at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- headquarters in mazar-i-sharif .
some 1,500 soldiers from 19 different countries attended .
the bodies were supposed to be flown back to germany earlier in the weekend , but the volcanic ash cloud that has disrupted european air travel in recent days forced the transport to be delayed .
a funeral in southern germany is planned for friday , but the exact date and time are unclear . germany 's national inspector of the armed forces , volker wieker , told the crowd that public debate about german troops ' participation in the afghan mission " should and will not be allowed to stand in the way of our security and the will of the afghan people . "
wieker said continued debate would play into the taliban 's strategy to weaken german resolve to stay in afghanistan .
the four dead all came from southern germany : a 33-year-old from ulm , a 28-year-old from weiden , and two 24 and 32-year old soldiers from ingolstadt .
five other soldiers were severely injured in the attack and evacuated to istanbul , where they are being treated in a us military hospital until they can be flown to germany .
the condition of two soldiers is still so serious that they could n't yet be transported , but a defense ministry spokesman said their condition was stable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 18.04.2010 early neo rauch patrons discuss ' magic and mystery ' of his art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's ' masterly ' painting appeals to art lovers , mera rubell says don and mera rubell began collecting art as newlyweds in new york city in 1964 .
they have collected steadily ever since , traveling the globe to acquire contemporary art works that appeal to their personal aesthetic . the rubell family collection now operates as a private museum and educational institution in miami , florida .
the collection today comprises more than 5,000 works .
it is housed in a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 45,000-square-foot -rrb- public space with a vast library , rotating exhibitions from the collection , and traveling exhibits that tour major museums throughout the us and abroad . the rubells were among the earliest proponents of neo rauch 's work .
they were " amazed ” by his paintings when they first saw his work at the liste young art fair in basel , switzerland , about a decade ago and bought their first work by rauch - ' das neue ' - in 2000 .
they later collected a number of paintings by rauch and other members of what would eventually be dubbed the leipzig school .
the rubells ' art foundation sponsored an exhibit of these combined works entitled “ life after death , ” which traveled to six us museums between 2004 and 2008 . deutsche welle spoke to the rubells just hours before they were due to fly to germany to celebrate the back-to-back openings of rauch exhibitions in leipzig -lrb- april 18 -rrb- and munich -lrb- april 20 -rrb- in honor of the artist 's 50th birthday . deutsche welle : don and mera rubell , can you tell me a little bit about your collection ?
who decides what you buy ? mera rubell : we 've been collecting art since we got married , 46 years ago .
we started with a working couple 's budget - i was a teacher and don was in medical school .
its been a relentless pursuit of contemporary art starting from the moment we got together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : don and mera rubell have been passionate collectors for 46 years don rubell : to answer your question , we do it ourselves .
now our son and daughter are very involved , so it 's the four of us who make all decisions as far as what we collect . mera : you can call it a family affair . let 's talk about neo rauch , who is turning 50 on april 18 .
why did you start collecting his works ? don : that 's an easy one .
he 's a great artist . so you saw his works and instantly knew … this is it ?
this is the one to buy ? don : with neo rauch it was sort of an odd thing because we saw his work early , early , early - like in ' 94 or ' 96 .
we liked it very much and thought about it , and followed it .
and the work became stronger and stronger .
and i guess it was around 2000 that we bought our first piece . mera : we were traveling to berlin after the wall came down , and someone said , ' you gotta check out what is going on in leipzig . '
so we went , and there is just a huge , old tradition of painting in that academy . what did rauch 's work mean to you when you saw it ? mera : somehow neo rauch was able to deliver a kind of history painting of a moment that passed , that had the psychological power of a time gone , and make it relevant today . don : it 's a combination of fantasy , surrealism and history .
but whether the exact history exists , or whether the imagination constructs the history , does n't matter .
the tone of the paintings is more historical than the fact of the paintings . mera : exactly !
it 's not like he 's telling you a specific story .
his paintings take you into some sort of psychological space , and what makes them powerful is that the psychological space almost bridges the place of history and present - and the future , really . he 's quite a master .
he has this ability with color , with figure , with drama .
these paintings are kind of stage paintings , a kind of storytelling .
and you can take that story into your own personal imagination . bildunterschrift : rauch 's works are ' a kind of storytelling that you can take into your imagination , ' mera rubell says rauch has been called the first german painter to bridge east and west germany … don : the impression of east germany is achieved more through his palette than his choice of subject matter .
so that the colors are reminiscent of some historical past , whereas his subject matter is almost timeless . the leipzig school painters became successful in the us , before they really got off the ground in germany . why is that ? don : i think that collectors of his work were not necessarily american but were very international .
and in a certain sense , this is how it goes .
it 's always difficult to deal with things close to home .
you find most of the great american pop art collections are in germany , for example . mera : i think it 's always dangerous to hold it against an artist for becoming quickly accepted .
i think europeans are much more comfortable with a long , slow-developing situation and career .
perhaps our enthusiasm put some people off . -lsb- with the traveling exhibit ' life after death ' -rsb- there was so much excitement around seeing the work in america , because it was a window into these very , very skillful painters , with of course neo being the master .
and no matter how much we want to walk away from trained classical painters , we ca n't .
it 's a love affair that will never , ever end . i have read that some of the leipzig school painters are unhappy with the moniker they were given .
they reject the idea that they are part of any school .
is that so ? don : you know , when pop art first became popular , all of the artists loved the moniker , because collectors would say , ' i 'd like to have pop art . '
as each of the artists became well known in their own right , they wanted the individuality of not being part of a group .
and in a sense you are dealing with the same thing here .
ultimately , each artist wants his or her own individuality . you 've said that when you first saw rauch 's work , around 1996 , he jumped out at you as ' someone to watch . '
what was his status at that time ?
was he already established , or young and struggling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's works combine a historical look with psychological pull don : the italians have a wonderful expression , ne carne ne pesce - neither fish nor fowl .
he was n't an international art star - no gallery in new york was even looking at him at that time .
but he clearly was way beyond the student stage . what would you say to someone who went to a neo rauch exhibition and found the work to be inscrutable and even frustrating , because they could n't figure out what the paintings were supposed to be about ? don : that 's a very good working definition of good contemporary art .
because what you always want to look for in all of the best young art is art that makes you slightly uncomfortable , and that deals with something you do n't understand .
and that gradually over a period of time , it becomes incorporated into your own essence . this is what happens with neo rauch .
i do n't know to this day what exactly they are about .
i just know they are powerful paintings .
the reason you do n't understand the painting is because no one has been able to determine the narrative of the painting .
so , drop the narrative - the narrative is not given to you . mera : but that 's how art is !
look , there is so much information in the world that gives you the answer .
most communication in the world today has the answer because people usually want you to buy something .
or do something .
or vote for somebody .
the answer is given to you .
most great art - the really good artists - are basically letting you in to their personal , mental space .
it 's not giving you any answers .
i think the artist is as disturbed by what he 's painting as you might be .
and you are !
i am too . it 's the magic and the mystery of painting .

they have collected steadily ever since , traveling the globe to acquire contemporary art works that appeal to their personal aesthetic . the rubell family collection now operates as a private museum and educational institution in miami , florida .
the collection today comprises more than 5,000 works .
it is housed in a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 45,000-square-foot -rrb- public space with a vast library , rotating exhibitions from the collection , and traveling exhibits that tour major museums throughout the us and abroad . the rubells were among the earliest proponents of neo rauch 's work .
they were " amazed ” by his paintings when they first saw his work at the liste young art fair in basel , switzerland , about a decade ago and bought their first work by rauch - ' das neue ' - in 2000 .
they later collected a number of paintings by rauch and other members of what would eventually be dubbed the leipzig school .
the rubells ' art foundation sponsored an exhibit of these combined works entitled “ life after death , ” which traveled to six us museums between 2004 and 2008 . deutsche welle spoke to the rubells just hours before they were due to fly to germany to celebrate the back-to-back openings of rauch exhibitions in leipzig -lrb- april 18 -rrb- and munich -lrb- april 20 -rrb- in honor of the artist 's 50th birthday . deutsche welle : don and mera rubell , can you tell me a little bit about your collection ?
who decides what you buy ? mera rubell : we 've been collecting art since we got married , 46 years ago .
we started with a working couple 's budget - i was a teacher and don was in medical school .
its been a relentless pursuit of contemporary art starting from the moment we got together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : don and mera rubell have been passionate collectors for 46 years don rubell : to answer your question , we do it ourselves .
now our son and daughter are very involved , so it 's the four of us who make all decisions as far as what we collect . mera : you can call it a family affair . let 's talk about neo rauch , who is turning 50 on april 18 .
why did you start collecting his works ? don : that 's an easy one .
he 's a great artist . so you saw his works and instantly knew … this is it ?
this is the one to buy ? don : with neo rauch it was sort of an odd thing because we saw his work early , early , early - like in ' 94 or ' 96 .
we liked it very much and thought about it , and followed it .
and the work became stronger and stronger .
and i guess it was around 2000 that we bought our first piece . mera : we were traveling to berlin after the wall came down , and someone said , ' you gotta check out what is going on in leipzig . '
so we went , and there is just a huge , old tradition of painting in that academy . what did rauch 's work mean to you when you saw it ? mera : somehow neo rauch was able to deliver a kind of history painting of a moment that passed , that had the psychological power of a time gone , and make it relevant today . don : it 's a combination of fantasy , surrealism and history .
but whether the exact history exists , or whether the imagination constructs the history , does n't matter .
the tone of the paintings is more historical than the fact of the paintings . mera : exactly !
it 's not like he 's telling you a specific story .
his paintings take you into some sort of psychological space , and what makes them powerful is that the psychological space almost bridges the place of history and present - and the future , really . he 's quite a master .
he has this ability with color , with figure , with drama .
these paintings are kind of stage paintings , a kind of storytelling .
and you can take that story into your own personal imagination . bildunterschrift : rauch 's works are ' a kind of storytelling that you can take into your imagination , ' mera rubell says rauch has been called the first german painter to bridge east and west germany … don : the impression of east germany is achieved more through his palette than his choice of subject matter .
so that the colors are reminiscent of some historical past , whereas his subject matter is almost timeless . the leipzig school painters became successful in the us , before they really got off the ground in germany . why is that ? don : i think that collectors of his work were not necessarily american but were very international .
and in a certain sense , this is how it goes .
it 's always difficult to deal with things close to home .
you find most of the great american pop art collections are in germany , for example . mera : i think it 's always dangerous to hold it against an artist for becoming quickly accepted .
i think europeans are much more comfortable with a long , slow-developing situation and career .
perhaps our enthusiasm put some people off . -lsb- with the traveling exhibit ' life after death ' -rsb- there was so much excitement around seeing the work in america , because it was a window into these very , very skillful painters , with of course neo being the master .
and no matter how much we want to walk away from trained classical painters , we ca n't .
it 's a love affair that will never , ever end . i have read that some of the leipzig school painters are unhappy with the moniker they were given .
they reject the idea that they are part of any school .
is that so ? don : you know , when pop art first became popular , all of the artists loved the moniker , because collectors would say , ' i 'd like to have pop art . '
as each of the artists became well known in their own right , they wanted the individuality of not being part of a group .
and in a sense you are dealing with the same thing here .
ultimately , each artist wants his or her own individuality . you 've said that when you first saw rauch 's work , around 1996 , he jumped out at you as ' someone to watch . '
what was his status at that time ?
was he already established , or young and struggling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's works combine a historical look with psychological pull don : the italians have a wonderful expression , ne carne ne pesce - neither fish nor fowl .
he was n't an international art star - no gallery in new york was even looking at him at that time .
but he clearly was way beyond the student stage . what would you say to someone who went to a neo rauch exhibition and found the work to be inscrutable and even frustrating , because they could n't figure out what the paintings were supposed to be about ? don : that 's a very good working definition of good contemporary art .
because what you always want to look for in all of the best young art is art that makes you slightly uncomfortable , and that deals with something you do n't understand .
and that gradually over a period of time , it becomes incorporated into your own essence . this is what happens with neo rauch .
i do n't know to this day what exactly they are about .
i just know they are powerful paintings .
the reason you do n't understand the painting is because no one has been able to determine the narrative of the painting .
so , drop the narrative - the narrative is not given to you . mera : but that 's how art is !
look , there is so much information in the world that gives you the answer .
most communication in the world today has the answer because people usually want you to buy something .
or do something .
or vote for somebody .
the answer is given to you .
most great art - the really good artists - are basically letting you in to their personal , mental space .
it 's not giving you any answers .
i think the artist is as disturbed by what he 's painting as you might be .
and you are !
i am too . it 's the magic and the mystery of painting .
it goes off into the far reaches of our imaginations and has no answers .
but it certainly engages us emotionally . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i do n't know to this day what exactly they are about .
i just know they are powerful paintings .
the reason you do n't understand the painting is because no one has been able to determine the narrative of the painting .
so , drop the narrative - the narrative is not given to you . mera : but that 's how art is !
look , there is so much information in the world that gives you the answer .
most communication in the world today has the answer because people usually want you to buy something .
or do something .
or vote for somebody .
the answer is given to you .
most great art - the really good artists - are basically letting you in to their personal , mental space .
it 's not giving you any answers .
i think the artist is as disturbed by what he 's painting as you might be .
and you are !
i am too . it 's the magic and the mystery of painting .
it goes off into the far reaches of our imaginations and has no answers .
but it certainly engages us emotionally . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

superior strategic calls early on helped mercedes ' nico rosberg claim third place . jenson button has won his second race of the 2010 formula one season , coming from fifth on the grid in difficult , changeable weather conditions .
as in australia earlier this year , button 's victory was partly thanks to him keeping cool in the treacherous weather and being on the right kind of tires at the right time .
button - who many believed could struggle in his new mercedes-powered mclaren against the highly-fancied 2008 champion lewis hamilton - is now ten points clear of the pack in the overall driver 's standings , having led the field all season long last year .
" this win is something very special , and it really means a lot to me , " button said in the post-race press conference .
" all in all , i am very happy with the team 's progress too .
we made another big step in the right direction today . "
the mclaren-mercedes driver , faced with the nightmarish situation of drizzle beginning to fall moments before the race began , elected to struggle round on dry weather tires and wait to see if the rain set in .
meanwhile , the enormous majority of the field hit the panic button and dove straight into the pits for wet weather tires . bildunterschrift : it was reigning champion jenson button who managed to handle the difficult conditions best the rain soon abated .
button , nico rosberg and the renault drivers robert kubica and vitaly petrov sauntered off into the distance , as the rest of the field eventually had to pit again - losing more time - to go back to dry tires .
in this early phase of the race in shanghai , button hunted down and overtook the early leader nico rosberg - whose mercedes gp car was no match for the mclaren , especially in terms of straight-line speed .
once in front , he was never challenged .
mercedes engines dominate button 's teammate lewis hamilton also managed to climb the ranks and overtake rosberg during the course of the race , but the young german - whose result puts him second in the title behind button - felt had got the best result his car could deliver on the day .
" i 'm extremely happy , this is a super result for us , " rosberg said after the race .
" it was a crazy race in really difficult conditions .
the key to success was the opening phase , when the team and i decided to stay on dry tires .
i stayed out on track , just thinking : ' please , please do n't rain any more ! '
luckily the rain did n't get heavier , so i was able to keep up a good pace and lead the way in the early stages . "
rosberg is still seeking his maiden victory in formula one .
" if you had offered me third position coming into this race , i would have taken it , " mercedes ' motorsport director norbert haug said on german television , also pointing out that the two mclarens ahead purchase their engines from mercedes .
" i would n't have really expected nico to be second overall after four races , it 's fantastic .
the championship is wide open , and we are certainly in the race . "

vettel showed great speed during the race , and eventually clawed his way back up to sixth position .
12 months ago on a wet track in shanghai , he provided his red bull team with their first ever f1 win .
" we could have lost a lot more today , " he later reflected . vettel could have crashed at one stage as he battled into and out of the pit lane with eventual second place finisher lewis hamilton .
the racing incident was investigated ; both drivers received a reprimand but not a penalty .

" to be honest , this whole weekend was a disappointment to me , and disappointing from me , " schumacher lamented .
" i just have to write it off , try to learn for it , and concentrate on the next race in barcelona in three weeks time . "
schumacher 's mercedes team - like many others around the grid - were planning to use the three week break before the spanish grand prix to introduce a major package of performance upgrades for their car . but with european air travel still in chaos because of the volcanic eruption in iceland , the first item on the agenda for the teams right now is shipping their current cars back to europe in time for the next race .

the maltese men who claimed they were abused by priests while living in an orphanage had requested a private meeting with the pope .
earlier on sunday , his second day in malta , the pope celebrated an open air mass in malta 's biggest square .
church officials estimated up to 10,000 people attended despite heavy rain showers . during his addresss , benedict praised malta 's opposition to divorce and urged followers in the heavily catholic nation to uphold their faith .
" at every moment of our lives we depend entirely on god , " the pope told those gathered .

the maltese men who claimed they were abused by priests while living in an orphanage had requested a private meeting with the pope .
earlier on sunday , his second day in malta , the pope celebrated an open air mass in malta 's biggest square .
church officials estimated up to 10,000 people attended despite heavy rain showers . during his addresss , benedict praised malta 's opposition to divorce and urged followers in the heavily catholic nation to uphold their faith .
" at every moment of our lives we depend entirely on god , " the pope told those gathered .

they have collected steadily ever since , traveling the globe to acquire contemporary art works that appeal to their personal aesthetic . the rubell family collection now operates as a private museum and educational institution in miami , florida .
the collection today comprises more than 5,000 works .
it is housed in a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 45,000-square-foot -rrb- public space with a vast library , rotating exhibitions from the collection , and traveling exhibits that tour major museums throughout the us and abroad . the rubells were among the earliest proponents of neo rauch 's work .
they were " amazed ” by his paintings when they first saw his work at the liste young art fair in basel , switzerland , about a decade ago and bought their first work by rauch - ' das neue ' - in 2000 .
they later collected a number of paintings by rauch and other members of what would eventually be dubbed the leipzig school .
the rubells ' art foundation sponsored an exhibit of these combined works entitled “ life after death , ” which traveled to six us museums between 2004 and 2008 . deutsche welle spoke to the rubells just hours before they were due to fly to germany to celebrate the back-to-back openings of rauch exhibitions in leipzig -lrb- april 18 -rrb- and munich -lrb- april 20 -rrb- in honor of the artist 's 50th birthday . deutsche welle : don and mera rubell , can you tell me a little bit about your collection ?
who decides what you buy ? mera rubell : we 've been collecting art since we got married , 46 years ago .
we started with a working couple 's budget - i was a teacher and don was in medical school .
its been a relentless pursuit of contemporary art starting from the moment we got together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : don and mera rubell have been passionate collectors for 46 years don rubell : to answer your question , we do it ourselves .
now our son and daughter are very involved , so it 's the four of us who make all decisions as far as what we collect . mera : you can call it a family affair . let 's talk about neo rauch , who is turning 50 on april 18 .
why did you start collecting his works ? don : that 's an easy one .
he 's a great artist . so you saw his works and instantly knew … this is it ?
this is the one to buy ? don : with neo rauch it was sort of an odd thing because we saw his work early , early , early - like in ' 94 or ' 96 .
we liked it very much and thought about it , and followed it .
and the work became stronger and stronger .
and i guess it was around 2000 that we bought our first piece . mera : we were traveling to berlin after the wall came down , and someone said , ' you gotta check out what is going on in leipzig . '
so we went , and there is just a huge , old tradition of painting in that academy . what did rauch 's work mean to you when you saw it ? mera : somehow neo rauch was able to deliver a kind of history painting of a moment that passed , that had the psychological power of a time gone , and make it relevant today . don : it 's a combination of fantasy , surrealism and history .
but whether the exact history exists , or whether the imagination constructs the history , does n't matter .
the tone of the paintings is more historical than the fact of the paintings . mera : exactly !
it 's not like he 's telling you a specific story .
his paintings take you into some sort of psychological space , and what makes them powerful is that the psychological space almost bridges the place of history and present - and the future , really . he 's quite a master .
he has this ability with color , with figure , with drama .
these paintings are kind of stage paintings , a kind of storytelling .
and you can take that story into your own personal imagination . bildunterschrift : rauch 's works are ' a kind of storytelling that you can take into your imagination , ' mera rubell says rauch has been called the first german painter to bridge east and west germany … don : the impression of east germany is achieved more through his palette than his choice of subject matter .
so that the colors are reminiscent of some historical past , whereas his subject matter is almost timeless . the leipzig school painters became successful in the us , before they really got off the ground in germany . why is that ? don : i think that collectors of his work were not necessarily american but were very international .
and in a certain sense , this is how it goes .
it 's always difficult to deal with things close to home .
you find most of the great american pop art collections are in germany , for example . mera : i think it 's always dangerous to hold it against an artist for becoming quickly accepted .
i think europeans are much more comfortable with a long , slow-developing situation and career .
perhaps our enthusiasm put some people off . -lsb- with the traveling exhibit ' life after death ' -rsb- there was so much excitement around seeing the work in america , because it was a window into these very , very skillful painters , with of course neo being the master .
and no matter how much we want to walk away from trained classical painters , we ca n't .
it 's a love affair that will never , ever end . i have read that some of the leipzig school painters are unhappy with the moniker they were given .
they reject the idea that they are part of any school .
is that so ? don : you know , when pop art first became popular , all of the artists loved the moniker , because collectors would say , ' i 'd like to have pop art . '
as each of the artists became well known in their own right , they wanted the individuality of not being part of a group .
and in a sense you are dealing with the same thing here .
ultimately , each artist wants his or her own individuality . you 've said that when you first saw rauch 's work , around 1996 , he jumped out at you as ' someone to watch . '
what was his status at that time ?
was he already established , or young and struggling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's works combine a historical look with psychological pull don : the italians have a wonderful expression , ne carne ne pesce - neither fish nor fowl .
he was n't an international art star - no gallery in new york was even looking at him at that time .
but he clearly was way beyond the student stage . what would you say to someone who went to a neo rauch exhibition and found the work to be inscrutable and even frustrating , because they could n't figure out what the paintings were supposed to be about ? don : that 's a very good working definition of good contemporary art .
because what you always want to look for in all of the best young art is art that makes you slightly uncomfortable , and that deals with something you do n't understand .
and that gradually over a period of time , it becomes incorporated into your own essence . this is what happens with neo rauch .
i do n't know to this day what exactly they are about .
i just know they are powerful paintings .
the reason you do n't understand the painting is because no one has been able to determine the narrative of the painting .
so , drop the narrative - the narrative is not given to you . mera : but that 's how art is !
look , there is so much information in the world that gives you the answer .
most communication in the world today has the answer because people usually want you to buy something .
or do something .
or vote for somebody .
the answer is given to you .
most great art - the really good artists - are basically letting you in to their personal , mental space .
it 's not giving you any answers .
i think the artist is as disturbed by what he 's painting as you might be .
and you are !
i am too . it 's the magic and the mystery of painting .
it goes off into the far reaches of our imaginations and has no answers .

they have collected steadily ever since , traveling the globe to acquire contemporary art works that appeal to their personal aesthetic . the rubell family collection now operates as a private museum and educational institution in miami , florida .
the collection today comprises more than 5,000 works .
it is housed in a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 45,000-square-foot -rrb- public space with a vast library , rotating exhibitions from the collection , and traveling exhibits that tour major museums throughout the us and abroad . the rubells were among the earliest proponents of neo rauch 's work .
they were " amazed ” by his paintings when they first saw his work at the liste young art fair in basel , switzerland , about a decade ago and bought their first work by rauch - ' das neue ' - in 2000 .
they later collected a number of paintings by rauch and other members of what would eventually be dubbed the leipzig school .
the rubells ' art foundation sponsored an exhibit of these combined works entitled “ life after death , ” which traveled to six us museums between 2004 and 2008 . deutsche welle spoke to the rubells just hours before they were due to fly to germany to celebrate the back-to-back openings of rauch exhibitions in leipzig -lrb- april 18 -rrb- and munich -lrb- april 20 -rrb- in honor of the artist 's 50th birthday . deutsche welle : don and mera rubell , can you tell me a little bit about your collection ?
who decides what you buy ? mera rubell : we 've been collecting art since we got married , 46 years ago .
we started with a working couple 's budget - i was a teacher and don was in medical school .
its been a relentless pursuit of contemporary art starting from the moment we got together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : don and mera rubell have been passionate collectors for 46 years don rubell : to answer your question , we do it ourselves .
now our son and daughter are very involved , so it 's the four of us who make all decisions as far as what we collect . mera : you can call it a family affair . let 's talk about neo rauch , who is turning 50 on april 18 .
why did you start collecting his works ? don : that 's an easy one .
he 's a great artist . so you saw his works and instantly knew … this is it ?
this is the one to buy ? don : with neo rauch it was sort of an odd thing because we saw his work early , early , early - like in ' 94 or ' 96 .
we liked it very much and thought about it , and followed it .
and the work became stronger and stronger .
and i guess it was around 2000 that we bought our first piece . mera : we were traveling to berlin after the wall came down , and someone said , ' you gotta check out what is going on in leipzig . '
so we went , and there is just a huge , old tradition of painting in that academy . what did rauch 's work mean to you when you saw it ? mera : somehow neo rauch was able to deliver a kind of history painting of a moment that passed , that had the psychological power of a time gone , and make it relevant today . don : it 's a combination of fantasy , surrealism and history .
but whether the exact history exists , or whether the imagination constructs the history , does n't matter .
the tone of the paintings is more historical than the fact of the paintings . mera : exactly !
it 's not like he 's telling you a specific story .
his paintings take you into some sort of psychological space , and what makes them powerful is that the psychological space almost bridges the place of history and present - and the future , really . he 's quite a master .
he has this ability with color , with figure , with drama .
these paintings are kind of stage paintings , a kind of storytelling .
and you can take that story into your own personal imagination . bildunterschrift : rauch 's works are ' a kind of storytelling that you can take into your imagination , ' mera rubell says rauch has been called the first german painter to bridge east and west germany … don : the impression of east germany is achieved more through his palette than his choice of subject matter .
so that the colors are reminiscent of some historical past , whereas his subject matter is almost timeless . the leipzig school painters became successful in the us , before they really got off the ground in germany . why is that ? don : i think that collectors of his work were not necessarily american but were very international .
and in a certain sense , this is how it goes .
it 's always difficult to deal with things close to home .
you find most of the great american pop art collections are in germany , for example . mera : i think it 's always dangerous to hold it against an artist for becoming quickly accepted .
i think europeans are much more comfortable with a long , slow-developing situation and career .
perhaps our enthusiasm put some people off . -lsb- with the traveling exhibit ' life after death ' -rsb- there was so much excitement around seeing the work in america , because it was a window into these very , very skillful painters , with of course neo being the master .
and no matter how much we want to walk away from trained classical painters , we ca n't .
it 's a love affair that will never , ever end . i have read that some of the leipzig school painters are unhappy with the moniker they were given .
they reject the idea that they are part of any school .
is that so ? don : you know , when pop art first became popular , all of the artists loved the moniker , because collectors would say , ' i 'd like to have pop art . '
as each of the artists became well known in their own right , they wanted the individuality of not being part of a group .
and in a sense you are dealing with the same thing here .
ultimately , each artist wants his or her own individuality . you 've said that when you first saw rauch 's work , around 1996 , he jumped out at you as ' someone to watch . '
what was his status at that time ?
was he already established , or young and struggling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's works combine a historical look with psychological pull don : the italians have a wonderful expression , ne carne ne pesce - neither fish nor fowl .
he was n't an international art star - no gallery in new york was even looking at him at that time .
but he clearly was way beyond the student stage . what would you say to someone who went to a neo rauch exhibition and found the work to be inscrutable and even frustrating , because they could n't figure out what the paintings were supposed to be about ? don : that 's a very good working definition of good contemporary art .
because what you always want to look for in all of the best young art is art that makes you slightly uncomfortable , and that deals with something you do n't understand .
and that gradually over a period of time , it becomes incorporated into your own essence . this is what happens with neo rauch .
i do n't know to this day what exactly they are about .
i just know they are powerful paintings .
the reason you do n't understand the painting is because no one has been able to determine the narrative of the painting .
so , drop the narrative - the narrative is not given to you . mera : but that 's how art is !
look , there is so much information in the world that gives you the answer .
most communication in the world today has the answer because people usually want you to buy something .
or do something .
or vote for somebody .
the answer is given to you .
most great art - the really good artists - are basically letting you in to their personal , mental space .
it 's not giving you any answers .
i think the artist is as disturbed by what he 's painting as you might be .
and you are !
i am too . it 's the magic and the mystery of painting .
it goes off into the far reaches of our imaginations and has no answers .
but it certainly engages us emotionally . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they have collected steadily ever since , traveling the globe to acquire contemporary art works that appeal to their personal aesthetic . the rubell family collection now operates as a private museum and educational institution in miami , florida .
the collection today comprises more than 5,000 works .
it is housed in a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 45,000-square-foot -rrb- public space with a vast library , rotating exhibitions from the collection , and traveling exhibits that tour major museums throughout the us and abroad . the rubells were among the earliest proponents of neo rauch 's work .
they were " amazed ” by his paintings when they first saw his work at the liste young art fair in basel , switzerland , about a decade ago and bought their first work by rauch - ' das neue ' - in 2000 .
they later collected a number of paintings by rauch and other members of what would eventually be dubbed the leipzig school .
the rubells ' art foundation sponsored an exhibit of these combined works entitled “ life after death , ” which traveled to six us museums between 2004 and 2008 . deutsche welle spoke to the rubells just hours before they were due to fly to germany to celebrate the back-to-back openings of rauch exhibitions in leipzig -lrb- april 18 -rrb- and munich -lrb- april 20 -rrb- in honor of the artist 's 50th birthday . deutsche welle : don and mera rubell , can you tell me a little bit about your collection ?
who decides what you buy ? mera rubell : we 've been collecting art since we got married , 46 years ago .
we started with a working couple 's budget - i was a teacher and don was in medical school .
its been a relentless pursuit of contemporary art starting from the moment we got together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : don and mera rubell have been passionate collectors for 46 years don rubell : to answer your question , we do it ourselves .
now our son and daughter are very involved , so it 's the four of us who make all decisions as far as what we collect . mera : you can call it a family affair . let 's talk about neo rauch , who is turning 50 on april 18 .
why did you start collecting his works ? don : that 's an easy one .
he 's a great artist . so you saw his works and instantly knew … this is it ?
this is the one to buy ? don : with neo rauch it was sort of an odd thing because we saw his work early , early , early - like in ' 94 or ' 96 .
we liked it very much and thought about it , and followed it .
and the work became stronger and stronger .
and i guess it was around 2000 that we bought our first piece . mera : we were traveling to berlin after the wall came down , and someone said , ' you gotta check out what is going on in leipzig . '
so we went , and there is just a huge , old tradition of painting in that academy . what did rauch 's work mean to you when you saw it ? mera : somehow neo rauch was able to deliver a kind of history painting of a moment that passed , that had the psychological power of a time gone , and make it relevant today . don : it 's a combination of fantasy , surrealism and history .
but whether the exact history exists , or whether the imagination constructs the history , does n't matter .
the tone of the paintings is more historical than the fact of the paintings . mera : exactly !
it 's not like he 's telling you a specific story .
his paintings take you into some sort of psychological space , and what makes them powerful is that the psychological space almost bridges the place of history and present - and the future , really . he 's quite a master .
he has this ability with color , with figure , with drama .
these paintings are kind of stage paintings , a kind of storytelling .
and you can take that story into your own personal imagination . bildunterschrift : rauch 's works are ' a kind of storytelling that you can take into your imagination , ' mera rubell says rauch has been called the first german painter to bridge east and west germany … don : the impression of east germany is achieved more through his palette than his choice of subject matter .
so that the colors are reminiscent of some historical past , whereas his subject matter is almost timeless . the leipzig school painters became successful in the us , before they really got off the ground in germany . why is that ? don : i think that collectors of his work were not necessarily american but were very international .
and in a certain sense , this is how it goes .
it 's always difficult to deal with things close to home .
you find most of the great american pop art collections are in germany , for example . mera : i think it 's always dangerous to hold it against an artist for becoming quickly accepted .
i think europeans are much more comfortable with a long , slow-developing situation and career .
perhaps our enthusiasm put some people off . -lsb- with the traveling exhibit ' life after death ' -rsb- there was so much excitement around seeing the work in america , because it was a window into these very , very skillful painters , with of course neo being the master .
and no matter how much we want to walk away from trained classical painters , we ca n't .
it 's a love affair that will never , ever end . i have read that some of the leipzig school painters are unhappy with the moniker they were given .
they reject the idea that they are part of any school .
is that so ? don : you know , when pop art first became popular , all of the artists loved the moniker , because collectors would say , ' i 'd like to have pop art . '
as each of the artists became well known in their own right , they wanted the individuality of not being part of a group .
and in a sense you are dealing with the same thing here .
ultimately , each artist wants his or her own individuality . you 've said that when you first saw rauch 's work , around 1996 , he jumped out at you as ' someone to watch . '
what was his status at that time ?
was he already established , or young and struggling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's works combine a historical look with psychological pull don : the italians have a wonderful expression , ne carne ne pesce - neither fish nor fowl .
he was n't an international art star - no gallery in new york was even looking at him at that time .
but he clearly was way beyond the student stage . what would you say to someone who went to a neo rauch exhibition and found the work to be inscrutable and even frustrating , because they could n't figure out what the paintings were supposed to be about ? don : that 's a very good working definition of good contemporary art .
because what you always want to look for in all of the best young art is art that makes you slightly uncomfortable , and that deals with something you do n't understand .
and that gradually over a period of time , it becomes incorporated into your own essence . this is what happens with neo rauch .
i do n't know to this day what exactly they are about .
i just know they are powerful paintings .
the reason you do n't understand the painting is because no one has been able to determine the narrative of the painting .
so , drop the narrative - the narrative is not given to you . mera : but that 's how art is !
look , there is so much information in the world that gives you the answer .
most communication in the world today has the answer because people usually want you to buy something .
or do something .
or vote for somebody .
the answer is given to you .
most great art - the really good artists - are basically letting you in to their personal , mental space .
it 's not giving you any answers .
i think the artist is as disturbed by what he 's painting as you might be .
and you are !
i am too . it 's the magic and the mystery of painting .
it goes off into the far reaches of our imaginations and has no answers .
but it certainly engages us emotionally . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the maltese men who claimed they were abused by priests while living in an orphanage had requested a private meeting with the pope .
earlier on sunday , his second day in malta , the pope celebrated an open air mass in malta 's biggest square .
church officials estimated up to 10,000 people attended despite heavy rain showers . during his addresss , benedict praised malta 's opposition to divorce and urged followers in the heavily catholic nation to uphold their faith .
" at every moment of our lives we depend entirely on god , " the pope told those gathered .
no comment until the meeting with the abuse victims , the pontiff had not commented directly on the allegations that the church covered up for priests who molested minors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch has said that the german church stands behind the pope " these meetings are never announced beforehand , " the pope 's spokesman , federico lombardi , told reporters .
but malta 's top archbishop , paul cremona , was more critical . " we can not just cling to the model of the church to which we have been accustomed for decades , " cremona said as he opened the papal mass .
he did not directly mention the scandal but said the " church must be humble enough to recognize the failures and sins of its members . "
top german bishop supports pope but a top bishop in benedict 's native germany offered benedikt his " unreserved solidarity " as the pontiff marks the fifth anniversary of his election .
archbishop robert zollitsch , the head of the german bishops ' conference , wrote in a congratulatory letter that the pope could rely on the german church 's " full support . "

buyers included the german state-owned kfw development bank and the german bank ikb deutsche industriebank , which had to be bailed out by taxpayers after it lost nearly 111 million euros according to the indictment .

goldman has defended itself against the allegations , and claims that it lost 66 million euro -lrb- $ 90 million -rrb- from its own investment in the security .

the memorial for the four germans killed last thursday in a rocket attack was held at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- headquarters in mazar-i-sharif .
some 1,500 soldiers from 19 different countries attended .
the bodies were supposed to be flown back to germany earlier in the weekend , but the volcanic ash cloud that has disrupted european air travel in recent days forced the transport to be delayed .
a funeral in southern germany is planned for friday , but the exact date and time are unclear . germany 's national inspector of the armed forces , volker wieker , told the crowd that public debate about german troops ' participation in the afghan mission " should and will not be allowed to stand in the way of our security and the will of the afghan people . "
wieker said continued debate would play into the taliban 's strategy to weaken german resolve to stay in afghanistan .
the four dead all came from southern germany : a 33-year-old from ulm , a 28-year-old from weiden , and two 24 and 32-year old soldiers from ingolstadt .
five other soldiers were severely injured in the attack and evacuated to istanbul , where they are being treated in a us military hospital until they can be flown to germany .

however , he has also said he would not abandon the reunification talks . " talks will continue because i want peace more than those who say that i do n't , " eroglu told supporters after declaring victory .
" i seek a solution based on the realities of the island and a solution that all of us can live with . " around 164,000 people out of the 250,000 population of the island were eligible to vote .
turnout was reported to be about 75 percent . bildunterschrift : turkey is the only country to recognize the turkish cypriot government reunification ' a steep and uphill push ' analysts have said the election results would likely delay reunification efforts , and that leaders may have to lower their expectations if they want to find a solution that can be agreed on by both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus has been divided since 1974 " nobody is going to walk away from the table , but this makes reunification a steep and uphill push , " said hugh pope , turkey-cyprus director for the international crisis group .
" everybody will have to think again and find a way forward . " cypriot voters on both the greek and turkish sides would have to approve any deal between their leaders in a referendum . peace talks on hold with 95 percent of sunday 's vote counted , eroglu won slightly more than the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff against incumbent president mehmet ali talat .
talat received 42.8 percent of the vote . talat , leader of the left-leaning republican turkish party -lrb- ctp -rrb- , supports reunification of the island , which has been divided into the greek south and turkish north since 1974 . turkey is the only country that recognizes the government of the self-declared turkish cypriot state , which it has occupied since 1974 .
ankara still keeps some 35,000 troops on the mediterranean island . the greek cypriot government represents the island in the european union , and says it will continue to block turkey 's attempt to join the eu as long as the island remains divided . the united nations-led peace talks on the mediterranean island were on hold during the election campaign . cb / acb / svs / afp / ap / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the memorial for the four germans killed last thursday in a rocket attack was held at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- headquarters in mazar-i-sharif .
some 1,500 soldiers from 19 different countries attended .
the bodies were supposed to be flown back to germany earlier in the weekend , but the volcanic ash cloud that has disrupted european air travel in recent days forced the transport to be delayed .
a funeral in southern germany is planned for friday , but the exact date and time are unclear . germany 's national inspector of the armed forces , volker wieker , told the crowd that public debate about german troops ' participation in the afghan mission " should and will not be allowed to stand in the way of our security and the will of the afghan people . "
wieker said continued debate would play into the taliban 's strategy to weaken german resolve to stay in afghanistan .
the four dead all came from southern germany : a 33-year-old from ulm , a 28-year-old from weiden , and two 24 and 32-year old soldiers from ingolstadt .
five other soldiers were severely injured in the attack and evacuated to istanbul , where they are being treated in a us military hospital until they can be flown to germany .
the condition of two soldiers is still so serious that they could n't yet be transported , but a defense ministry spokesman said their condition was stable .

superior strategic calls early on helped mercedes ' nico rosberg claim third place . jenson button has won his second race of the 2010 formula one season , coming from fifth on the grid in difficult , changeable weather conditions .
as in australia earlier this year , button 's victory was partly thanks to him keeping cool in the treacherous weather and being on the right kind of tires at the right time .
button - who many believed could struggle in his new mercedes-powered mclaren against the highly-fancied 2008 champion lewis hamilton - is now ten points clear of the pack in the overall driver 's standings , having led the field all season long last year .
" this win is something very special , and it really means a lot to me , " button said in the post-race press conference .
" all in all , i am very happy with the team 's progress too .
we made another big step in the right direction today . "
the mclaren-mercedes driver , faced with the nightmarish situation of drizzle beginning to fall moments before the race began , elected to struggle round on dry weather tires and wait to see if the rain set in .
meanwhile , the enormous majority of the field hit the panic button and dove straight into the pits for wet weather tires . bildunterschrift : it was reigning champion jenson button who managed to handle the difficult conditions best the rain soon abated .
button , nico rosberg and the renault drivers robert kubica and vitaly petrov sauntered off into the distance , as the rest of the field eventually had to pit again - losing more time - to go back to dry tires .
in this early phase of the race in shanghai , button hunted down and overtook the early leader nico rosberg - whose mercedes gp car was no match for the mclaren , especially in terms of straight-line speed .
once in front , he was never challenged .
mercedes engines dominate button 's teammate lewis hamilton also managed to climb the ranks and overtake rosberg during the course of the race , but the young german - whose result puts him second in the title behind button - felt had got the best result his car could deliver on the day .
" i 'm extremely happy , this is a super result for us , " rosberg said after the race .
" it was a crazy race in really difficult conditions .
the key to success was the opening phase , when the team and i decided to stay on dry tires .
i stayed out on track , just thinking : ' please , please do n't rain any more ! '
luckily the rain did n't get heavier , so i was able to keep up a good pace and lead the way in the early stages . "
rosberg is still seeking his maiden victory in formula one .
" if you had offered me third position coming into this race , i would have taken it , " mercedes ' motorsport director norbert haug said on german television , also pointing out that the two mclarens ahead purchase their engines from mercedes .
" i would n't have really expected nico to be second overall after four races , it 's fantastic .
the championship is wide open , and we are certainly in the race . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel was unable to build on his pole position disappointment for vettel pole-sitter sebastian vettel was one of many drivers to lose out in the opening chaos .
to make matters worse , vettel lost out to his teammate mark webber into turn one , meaning that when both red bull cars simultaneously pitted at the first opportunity , not only did vettel put on tires that turned out to be the wrong choice for the conditions , he had to queue behind webber for the privilege of doing so , losing even more places .
" that really ca n't be helped , " vettel said after the race .
" he -lrb- webber -rrb- got the place off the start line .
i need to work out why my start was n't as good as his , but that 's just the plight of the second-placed car .
in that situation , you have to wait in the pits . "
vettel showed great speed during the race , and eventually clawed his way back up to sixth position .
12 months ago on a wet track in shanghai , he provided his red bull team with their first ever f1 win .
" we could have lost a lot more today , " he later reflected . vettel could have crashed at one stage as he battled into and out of the pit lane with eventual second place finisher lewis hamilton .
the racing incident was investigated ; both drivers received a reprimand but not a penalty .
past his prime ?
michael schumacher was the third german driver to finish in the points in shanghai , coming home in tenth place .
however , the multiple champion was almost a minute adrift of his teammate nico rosberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking grim for schumi 's return to f1 once dubbed the " regenmeister " -lrb- rain master -rrb- because of peerless performances in wet conditions in his heyday , the 41-year-old 's lackluster display - especially in the latter stages - have increased speculation that he may never recapture his best form .
" to be honest , this whole weekend was a disappointment to me , and disappointing from me , " schumacher lamented .
" i just have to write it off , try to learn for it , and concentrate on the next race in barcelona in three weeks time . "
schumacher 's mercedes team - like many others around the grid - were planning to use the three week break before the spanish grand prix to introduce a major package of performance upgrades for their car . but with european air travel still in chaos because of the volcanic eruption in iceland , the first item on the agenda for the teams right now is shipping their current cars back to europe in time for the next race .
some outfits say they have been looking into alternative freight options using boats or trains , in case they ca n't fly the equipment back as usual .

many world leaders were unable to attend because of flights grounded by iceland 's volcano . thousands of mourners gathered for the funeral mass and burial of polish president lech kaczynski and his wife maria on sunday in krakow . tens of thousands of people lined the streets with outstretched hands , some holding flowers and national flags , and many wiping tears from their eyes .
hundreds of thousands were watching the events broadcast live in poland and around the world . " the death of these outstanding representatives of our people is a great loss for us .
people from all stations of life and various political views are lost , " said acting president bronislaw komorowski , in eulogizing not just the kacynzskis , but all those killed in the crash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the president will be buried at wawel , a complex of buildings on the vistula river during the funeral mass , the couple 's only child , marta , sat with her uncle , head of the opposition law and justice party , jaroslaw kaczynski , in the first row .
jaroslaw and lech kaczynski were twin brothers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 18.04.2010 early neo rauch patrons discuss ' magic and mystery ' of his art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's ' masterly ' painting appeals to art lovers , mera rubell says don and mera rubell began collecting art as newlyweds in new york city in 1964 .
they have collected steadily ever since , traveling the globe to acquire contemporary art works that appeal to their personal aesthetic . the rubell family collection now operates as a private museum and educational institution in miami , florida .
the collection today comprises more than 5,000 works .
it is housed in a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 45,000-square-foot -rrb- public space with a vast library , rotating exhibitions from the collection , and traveling exhibits that tour major museums throughout the us and abroad . the rubells were among the earliest proponents of neo rauch 's work .
they were " amazed ” by his paintings when they first saw his work at the liste young art fair in basel , switzerland , about a decade ago and bought their first work by rauch - ' das neue ' - in 2000 .
they later collected a number of paintings by rauch and other members of what would eventually be dubbed the leipzig school .
the rubells ' art foundation sponsored an exhibit of these combined works entitled “ life after death , ” which traveled to six us museums between 2004 and 2008 . deutsche welle spoke to the rubells just hours before they were due to fly to germany to celebrate the back-to-back openings of rauch exhibitions in leipzig -lrb- april 18 -rrb- and munich -lrb- april 20 -rrb- in honor of the artist 's 50th birthday . deutsche welle : don and mera rubell , can you tell me a little bit about your collection ?
who decides what you buy ? mera rubell : we 've been collecting art since we got married , 46 years ago .
we started with a working couple 's budget - i was a teacher and don was in medical school .
its been a relentless pursuit of contemporary art starting from the moment we got together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : don and mera rubell have been passionate collectors for 46 years don rubell : to answer your question , we do it ourselves .
now our son and daughter are very involved , so it 's the four of us who make all decisions as far as what we collect . mera : you can call it a family affair . let 's talk about neo rauch , who is turning 50 on april 18 .
why did you start collecting his works ? don : that 's an easy one .
he 's a great artist . so you saw his works and instantly knew … this is it ?
this is the one to buy ? don : with neo rauch it was sort of an odd thing because we saw his work early , early , early - like in ' 94 or ' 96 .
we liked it very much and thought about it , and followed it .
and the work became stronger and stronger .
and i guess it was around 2000 that we bought our first piece . mera : we were traveling to berlin after the wall came down , and someone said , ' you gotta check out what is going on in leipzig . '
so we went , and there is just a huge , old tradition of painting in that academy . what did rauch 's work mean to you when you saw it ? mera : somehow neo rauch was able to deliver a kind of history painting of a moment that passed , that had the psychological power of a time gone , and make it relevant today . don : it 's a combination of fantasy , surrealism and history .
but whether the exact history exists , or whether the imagination constructs the history , does n't matter .
the tone of the paintings is more historical than the fact of the paintings . mera : exactly !
it 's not like he 's telling you a specific story .
his paintings take you into some sort of psychological space , and what makes them powerful is that the psychological space almost bridges the place of history and present - and the future , really . he 's quite a master .
he has this ability with color , with figure , with drama .
these paintings are kind of stage paintings , a kind of storytelling .
and you can take that story into your own personal imagination . bildunterschrift : rauch 's works are ' a kind of storytelling that you can take into your imagination , ' mera rubell says rauch has been called the first german painter to bridge east and west germany … don : the impression of east germany is achieved more through his palette than his choice of subject matter .
so that the colors are reminiscent of some historical past , whereas his subject matter is almost timeless . the leipzig school painters became successful in the us , before they really got off the ground in germany . why is that ? don : i think that collectors of his work were not necessarily american but were very international .
and in a certain sense , this is how it goes .
it 's always difficult to deal with things close to home .
you find most of the great american pop art collections are in germany , for example . mera : i think it 's always dangerous to hold it against an artist for becoming quickly accepted .
i think europeans are much more comfortable with a long , slow-developing situation and career .
perhaps our enthusiasm put some people off . -lsb- with the traveling exhibit ' life after death ' -rsb- there was so much excitement around seeing the work in america , because it was a window into these very , very skillful painters , with of course neo being the master .
and no matter how much we want to walk away from trained classical painters , we ca n't .
it 's a love affair that will never , ever end . i have read that some of the leipzig school painters are unhappy with the moniker they were given .
they reject the idea that they are part of any school .
is that so ? don : you know , when pop art first became popular , all of the artists loved the moniker , because collectors would say , ' i 'd like to have pop art . '
as each of the artists became well known in their own right , they wanted the individuality of not being part of a group .
and in a sense you are dealing with the same thing here .
ultimately , each artist wants his or her own individuality . you 've said that when you first saw rauch 's work , around 1996 , he jumped out at you as ' someone to watch . '
what was his status at that time ?
was he already established , or young and struggling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's works combine a historical look with psychological pull don : the italians have a wonderful expression , ne carne ne pesce - neither fish nor fowl .
he was n't an international art star - no gallery in new york was even looking at him at that time .
but he clearly was way beyond the student stage . what would you say to someone who went to a neo rauch exhibition and found the work to be inscrutable and even frustrating , because they could n't figure out what the paintings were supposed to be about ? don : that 's a very good working definition of good contemporary art .
because what you always want to look for in all of the best young art is art that makes you slightly uncomfortable , and that deals with something you do n't understand .
and that gradually over a period of time , it becomes incorporated into your own essence . this is what happens with neo rauch .
i do n't know to this day what exactly they are about .
i just know they are powerful paintings .
the reason you do n't understand the painting is because no one has been able to determine the narrative of the painting .
so , drop the narrative - the narrative is not given to you . mera : but that 's how art is !
look , there is so much information in the world that gives you the answer .
most communication in the world today has the answer because people usually want you to buy something .
or do something .
or vote for somebody .
the answer is given to you .
most great art - the really good artists - are basically letting you in to their personal , mental space .
it 's not giving you any answers .
i think the artist is as disturbed by what he 's painting as you might be .
and you are !
i am too . it 's the magic and the mystery of painting .
it goes off into the far reaches of our imaginations and has no answers .
but it certainly engages us emotionally . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is housed in a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 45,000-square-foot -rrb- public space with a vast library , rotating exhibitions from the collection , and traveling exhibits that tour major museums throughout the us and abroad . the rubells were among the earliest proponents of neo rauch 's work .
they were " amazed ” by his paintings when they first saw his work at the liste young art fair in basel , switzerland , about a decade ago and bought their first work by rauch - ' das neue ' - in 2000 .
they later collected a number of paintings by rauch and other members of what would eventually be dubbed the leipzig school .
the rubells ' art foundation sponsored an exhibit of these combined works entitled “ life after death , ” which traveled to six us museums between 2004 and 2008 . deutsche welle spoke to the rubells just hours before they were due to fly to germany to celebrate the back-to-back openings of rauch exhibitions in leipzig -lrb- april 18 -rrb- and munich -lrb- april 20 -rrb- in honor of the artist 's 50th birthday . deutsche welle : don and mera rubell , can you tell me a little bit about your collection ?
who decides what you buy ? mera rubell : we 've been collecting art since we got married , 46 years ago .
we started with a working couple 's budget - i was a teacher and don was in medical school .
its been a relentless pursuit of contemporary art starting from the moment we got together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : don and mera rubell have been passionate collectors for 46 years don rubell : to answer your question , we do it ourselves .
now our son and daughter are very involved , so it 's the four of us who make all decisions as far as what we collect . mera : you can call it a family affair . let 's talk about neo rauch , who is turning 50 on april 18 .
why did you start collecting his works ? don : that 's an easy one .
he 's a great artist . so you saw his works and instantly knew … this is it ?
this is the one to buy ? don : with neo rauch it was sort of an odd thing because we saw his work early , early , early - like in ' 94 or ' 96 .
we liked it very much and thought about it , and followed it .
and the work became stronger and stronger .
and i guess it was around 2000 that we bought our first piece . mera : we were traveling to berlin after the wall came down , and someone said , ' you gotta check out what is going on in leipzig . '
so we went , and there is just a huge , old tradition of painting in that academy . what did rauch 's work mean to you when you saw it ? mera : somehow neo rauch was able to deliver a kind of history painting of a moment that passed , that had the psychological power of a time gone , and make it relevant today . don : it 's a combination of fantasy , surrealism and history .
but whether the exact history exists , or whether the imagination constructs the history , does n't matter .
the tone of the paintings is more historical than the fact of the paintings . mera : exactly !
it 's not like he 's telling you a specific story .
his paintings take you into some sort of psychological space , and what makes them powerful is that the psychological space almost bridges the place of history and present - and the future , really . he 's quite a master .
he has this ability with color , with figure , with drama .
these paintings are kind of stage paintings , a kind of storytelling .
and you can take that story into your own personal imagination . bildunterschrift : rauch 's works are ' a kind of storytelling that you can take into your imagination , ' mera rubell says rauch has been called the first german painter to bridge east and west germany … don : the impression of east germany is achieved more through his palette than his choice of subject matter .
so that the colors are reminiscent of some historical past , whereas his subject matter is almost timeless . the leipzig school painters became successful in the us , before they really got off the ground in germany . why is that ? don : i think that collectors of his work were not necessarily american but were very international .
and in a certain sense , this is how it goes .
it 's always difficult to deal with things close to home .
you find most of the great american pop art collections are in germany , for example . mera : i think it 's always dangerous to hold it against an artist for becoming quickly accepted .
i think europeans are much more comfortable with a long , slow-developing situation and career .
perhaps our enthusiasm put some people off . -lsb- with the traveling exhibit ' life after death ' -rsb- there was so much excitement around seeing the work in america , because it was a window into these very , very skillful painters , with of course neo being the master .
and no matter how much we want to walk away from trained classical painters , we ca n't .
it 's a love affair that will never , ever end . i have read that some of the leipzig school painters are unhappy with the moniker they were given .
they reject the idea that they are part of any school .
is that so ? don : you know , when pop art first became popular , all of the artists loved the moniker , because collectors would say , ' i 'd like to have pop art . '
as each of the artists became well known in their own right , they wanted the individuality of not being part of a group .
and in a sense you are dealing with the same thing here .
ultimately , each artist wants his or her own individuality . you 've said that when you first saw rauch 's work , around 1996 , he jumped out at you as ' someone to watch . '
what was his status at that time ?
was he already established , or young and struggling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's works combine a historical look with psychological pull don : the italians have a wonderful expression , ne carne ne pesce - neither fish nor fowl .
he was n't an international art star - no gallery in new york was even looking at him at that time .
but he clearly was way beyond the student stage . what would you say to someone who went to a neo rauch exhibition and found the work to be inscrutable and even frustrating , because they could n't figure out what the paintings were supposed to be about ? don : that 's a very good working definition of good contemporary art .
because what you always want to look for in all of the best young art is art that makes you slightly uncomfortable , and that deals with something you do n't understand .
and that gradually over a period of time , it becomes incorporated into your own essence . this is what happens with neo rauch .
i do n't know to this day what exactly they are about .
i just know they are powerful paintings .
the reason you do n't understand the painting is because no one has been able to determine the narrative of the painting .
so , drop the narrative - the narrative is not given to you . mera : but that 's how art is !
look , there is so much information in the world that gives you the answer .
most communication in the world today has the answer because people usually want you to buy something .
or do something .
or vote for somebody .
the answer is given to you .
most great art - the really good artists - are basically letting you in to their personal , mental space .
it 's not giving you any answers .
i think the artist is as disturbed by what he 's painting as you might be .
and you are !
i am too . it 's the magic and the mystery of painting .
it goes off into the far reaches of our imaginations and has no answers .
but it certainly engages us emotionally . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 18.04.2010 early neo rauch patrons discuss ' magic and mystery ' of his art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's ' masterly ' painting appeals to art lovers , mera rubell says don and mera rubell began collecting art as newlyweds in new york city in 1964 .
they have collected steadily ever since , traveling the globe to acquire contemporary art works that appeal to their personal aesthetic . the rubell family collection now operates as a private museum and educational institution in miami , florida .
the collection today comprises more than 5,000 works .
it is housed in a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 45,000-square-foot -rrb- public space with a vast library , rotating exhibitions from the collection , and traveling exhibits that tour major museums throughout the us and abroad . the rubells were among the earliest proponents of neo rauch 's work .
they were " amazed ” by his paintings when they first saw his work at the liste young art fair in basel , switzerland , about a decade ago and bought their first work by rauch - ' das neue ' - in 2000 .
they later collected a number of paintings by rauch and other members of what would eventually be dubbed the leipzig school .
the rubells ' art foundation sponsored an exhibit of these combined works entitled “ life after death , ” which traveled to six us museums between 2004 and 2008 . deutsche welle spoke to the rubells just hours before they were due to fly to germany to celebrate the back-to-back openings of rauch exhibitions in leipzig -lrb- april 18 -rrb- and munich -lrb- april 20 -rrb- in honor of the artist 's 50th birthday . deutsche welle : don and mera rubell , can you tell me a little bit about your collection ?
who decides what you buy ? mera rubell : we 've been collecting art since we got married , 46 years ago .
we started with a working couple 's budget - i was a teacher and don was in medical school .
its been a relentless pursuit of contemporary art starting from the moment we got together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : don and mera rubell have been passionate collectors for 46 years don rubell : to answer your question , we do it ourselves .
now our son and daughter are very involved , so it 's the four of us who make all decisions as far as what we collect . mera : you can call it a family affair . let 's talk about neo rauch , who is turning 50 on april 18 .
why did you start collecting his works ? don : that 's an easy one .
he 's a great artist . so you saw his works and instantly knew … this is it ?
this is the one to buy ? don : with neo rauch it was sort of an odd thing because we saw his work early , early , early - like in ' 94 or ' 96 .
we liked it very much and thought about it , and followed it .
and the work became stronger and stronger .
and i guess it was around 2000 that we bought our first piece . mera : we were traveling to berlin after the wall came down , and someone said , ' you gotta check out what is going on in leipzig . '
so we went , and there is just a huge , old tradition of painting in that academy . what did rauch 's work mean to you when you saw it ? mera : somehow neo rauch was able to deliver a kind of history painting of a moment that passed , that had the psychological power of a time gone , and make it relevant today . don : it 's a combination of fantasy , surrealism and history .
but whether the exact history exists , or whether the imagination constructs the history , does n't matter .
the tone of the paintings is more historical than the fact of the paintings . mera : exactly !
it 's not like he 's telling you a specific story .
his paintings take you into some sort of psychological space , and what makes them powerful is that the psychological space almost bridges the place of history and present - and the future , really . he 's quite a master .
he has this ability with color , with figure , with drama .
these paintings are kind of stage paintings , a kind of storytelling .
and you can take that story into your own personal imagination . bildunterschrift : rauch 's works are ' a kind of storytelling that you can take into your imagination , ' mera rubell says rauch has been called the first german painter to bridge east and west germany … don : the impression of east germany is achieved more through his palette than his choice of subject matter .
so that the colors are reminiscent of some historical past , whereas his subject matter is almost timeless . the leipzig school painters became successful in the us , before they really got off the ground in germany . why is that ? don : i think that collectors of his work were not necessarily american but were very international .
and in a certain sense , this is how it goes .
it 's always difficult to deal with things close to home .
you find most of the great american pop art collections are in germany , for example . mera : i think it 's always dangerous to hold it against an artist for becoming quickly accepted .
i think europeans are much more comfortable with a long , slow-developing situation and career .
perhaps our enthusiasm put some people off . -lsb- with the traveling exhibit ' life after death ' -rsb- there was so much excitement around seeing the work in america , because it was a window into these very , very skillful painters , with of course neo being the master .
and no matter how much we want to walk away from trained classical painters , we ca n't .
it 's a love affair that will never , ever end . i have read that some of the leipzig school painters are unhappy with the moniker they were given .
they reject the idea that they are part of any school .
is that so ? don : you know , when pop art first became popular , all of the artists loved the moniker , because collectors would say , ' i 'd like to have pop art . '
as each of the artists became well known in their own right , they wanted the individuality of not being part of a group .
and in a sense you are dealing with the same thing here .
ultimately , each artist wants his or her own individuality . you 've said that when you first saw rauch 's work , around 1996 , he jumped out at you as ' someone to watch . '
what was his status at that time ?
was he already established , or young and struggling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's works combine a historical look with psychological pull don : the italians have a wonderful expression , ne carne ne pesce - neither fish nor fowl .
he was n't an international art star - no gallery in new york was even looking at him at that time .
but he clearly was way beyond the student stage . what would you say to someone who went to a neo rauch exhibition and found the work to be inscrutable and even frustrating , because they could n't figure out what the paintings were supposed to be about ? don : that 's a very good working definition of good contemporary art .
because what you always want to look for in all of the best young art is art that makes you slightly uncomfortable , and that deals with something you do n't understand .
and that gradually over a period of time , it becomes incorporated into your own essence . this is what happens with neo rauch .
i do n't know to this day what exactly they are about .
i just know they are powerful paintings .
the reason you do n't understand the painting is because no one has been able to determine the narrative of the painting .
so , drop the narrative - the narrative is not given to you . mera : but that 's how art is !
look , there is so much information in the world that gives you the answer .
most communication in the world today has the answer because people usually want you to buy something .
or do something .
or vote for somebody .
the answer is given to you .
most great art - the really good artists - are basically letting you in to their personal , mental space .
it 's not giving you any answers .
i think the artist is as disturbed by what he 's painting as you might be .
and you are !
i am too . it 's the magic and the mystery of painting .
it goes off into the far reaches of our imaginations and has no answers .
but it certainly engages us emotionally . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 18.04.2010 early neo rauch patrons discuss ' magic and mystery ' of his art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's ' masterly ' painting appeals to art lovers , mera rubell says don and mera rubell began collecting art as newlyweds in new york city in 1964 .
they have collected steadily ever since , traveling the globe to acquire contemporary art works that appeal to their personal aesthetic . the rubell family collection now operates as a private museum and educational institution in miami , florida .
the collection today comprises more than 5,000 works .
it is housed in a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 45,000-square-foot -rrb- public space with a vast library , rotating exhibitions from the collection , and traveling exhibits that tour major museums throughout the us and abroad . the rubells were among the earliest proponents of neo rauch 's work .
they were " amazed ” by his paintings when they first saw his work at the liste young art fair in basel , switzerland , about a decade ago and bought their first work by rauch - ' das neue ' - in 2000 .
they later collected a number of paintings by rauch and other members of what would eventually be dubbed the leipzig school .
the rubells ' art foundation sponsored an exhibit of these combined works entitled “ life after death , ” which traveled to six us museums between 2004 and 2008 . deutsche welle spoke to the rubells just hours before they were due to fly to germany to celebrate the back-to-back openings of rauch exhibitions in leipzig -lrb- april 18 -rrb- and munich -lrb- april 20 -rrb- in honor of the artist 's 50th birthday . deutsche welle : don and mera rubell , can you tell me a little bit about your collection ?
who decides what you buy ? mera rubell : we 've been collecting art since we got married , 46 years ago .
we started with a working couple 's budget - i was a teacher and don was in medical school .
its been a relentless pursuit of contemporary art starting from the moment we got together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : don and mera rubell have been passionate collectors for 46 years don rubell : to answer your question , we do it ourselves .
now our son and daughter are very involved , so it 's the four of us who make all decisions as far as what we collect . mera : you can call it a family affair . let 's talk about neo rauch , who is turning 50 on april 18 .
why did you start collecting his works ? don : that 's an easy one .
he 's a great artist . so you saw his works and instantly knew … this is it ?
this is the one to buy ? don : with neo rauch it was sort of an odd thing because we saw his work early , early , early - like in ' 94 or ' 96 .
we liked it very much and thought about it , and followed it .
and the work became stronger and stronger .
and i guess it was around 2000 that we bought our first piece . mera : we were traveling to berlin after the wall came down , and someone said , ' you gotta check out what is going on in leipzig . '
so we went , and there is just a huge , old tradition of painting in that academy . what did rauch 's work mean to you when you saw it ? mera : somehow neo rauch was able to deliver a kind of history painting of a moment that passed , that had the psychological power of a time gone , and make it relevant today . don : it 's a combination of fantasy , surrealism and history .
but whether the exact history exists , or whether the imagination constructs the history , does n't matter .
the tone of the paintings is more historical than the fact of the paintings . mera : exactly !
it 's not like he 's telling you a specific story .
his paintings take you into some sort of psychological space , and what makes them powerful is that the psychological space almost bridges the place of history and present - and the future , really . he 's quite a master .
he has this ability with color , with figure , with drama .
these paintings are kind of stage paintings , a kind of storytelling .
and you can take that story into your own personal imagination . bildunterschrift : rauch 's works are ' a kind of storytelling that you can take into your imagination , ' mera rubell says rauch has been called the first german painter to bridge east and west germany … don : the impression of east germany is achieved more through his palette than his choice of subject matter .
so that the colors are reminiscent of some historical past , whereas his subject matter is almost timeless . the leipzig school painters became successful in the us , before they really got off the ground in germany . why is that ? don : i think that collectors of his work were not necessarily american but were very international .
and in a certain sense , this is how it goes .
it 's always difficult to deal with things close to home .
you find most of the great american pop art collections are in germany , for example . mera : i think it 's always dangerous to hold it against an artist for becoming quickly accepted .
i think europeans are much more comfortable with a long , slow-developing situation and career .
perhaps our enthusiasm put some people off . -lsb- with the traveling exhibit ' life after death ' -rsb- there was so much excitement around seeing the work in america , because it was a window into these very , very skillful painters , with of course neo being the master .
and no matter how much we want to walk away from trained classical painters , we ca n't .
it 's a love affair that will never , ever end . i have read that some of the leipzig school painters are unhappy with the moniker they were given .
they reject the idea that they are part of any school .
is that so ? don : you know , when pop art first became popular , all of the artists loved the moniker , because collectors would say , ' i 'd like to have pop art . '
as each of the artists became well known in their own right , they wanted the individuality of not being part of a group .
and in a sense you are dealing with the same thing here .
ultimately , each artist wants his or her own individuality . you 've said that when you first saw rauch 's work , around 1996 , he jumped out at you as ' someone to watch . '
what was his status at that time ?
was he already established , or young and struggling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's works combine a historical look with psychological pull don : the italians have a wonderful expression , ne carne ne pesce - neither fish nor fowl .
he was n't an international art star - no gallery in new york was even looking at him at that time .
but he clearly was way beyond the student stage . what would you say to someone who went to a neo rauch exhibition and found the work to be inscrutable and even frustrating , because they could n't figure out what the paintings were supposed to be about ? don : that 's a very good working definition of good contemporary art .
because what you always want to look for in all of the best young art is art that makes you slightly uncomfortable , and that deals with something you do n't understand .
and that gradually over a period of time , it becomes incorporated into your own essence . this is what happens with neo rauch .
i do n't know to this day what exactly they are about .
i just know they are powerful paintings .
the reason you do n't understand the painting is because no one has been able to determine the narrative of the painting .
so , drop the narrative - the narrative is not given to you . mera : but that 's how art is !
look , there is so much information in the world that gives you the answer .
most communication in the world today has the answer because people usually want you to buy something .
or do something .
or vote for somebody .
the answer is given to you .
most great art - the really good artists - are basically letting you in to their personal , mental space .
it 's not giving you any answers .
i think the artist is as disturbed by what he 's painting as you might be .
and you are !
i am too . it 's the magic and the mystery of painting .
it goes off into the far reaches of our imaginations and has no answers .
but it certainly engages us emotionally . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they have collected steadily ever since , traveling the globe to acquire contemporary art works that appeal to their personal aesthetic . the rubell family collection now operates as a private museum and educational institution in miami , florida .
the collection today comprises more than 5,000 works .
it is housed in a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 45,000-square-foot -rrb- public space with a vast library , rotating exhibitions from the collection , and traveling exhibits that tour major museums throughout the us and abroad . the rubells were among the earliest proponents of neo rauch 's work .
they were " amazed ” by his paintings when they first saw his work at the liste young art fair in basel , switzerland , about a decade ago and bought their first work by rauch - ' das neue ' - in 2000 .
they later collected a number of paintings by rauch and other members of what would eventually be dubbed the leipzig school .
the rubells ' art foundation sponsored an exhibit of these combined works entitled “ life after death , ” which traveled to six us museums between 2004 and 2008 . deutsche welle spoke to the rubells just hours before they were due to fly to germany to celebrate the back-to-back openings of rauch exhibitions in leipzig -lrb- april 18 -rrb- and munich -lrb- april 20 -rrb- in honor of the artist 's 50th birthday . deutsche welle : don and mera rubell , can you tell me a little bit about your collection ?
who decides what you buy ? mera rubell : we 've been collecting art since we got married , 46 years ago .
we started with a working couple 's budget - i was a teacher and don was in medical school .
its been a relentless pursuit of contemporary art starting from the moment we got together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : don and mera rubell have been passionate collectors for 46 years don rubell : to answer your question , we do it ourselves .
now our son and daughter are very involved , so it 's the four of us who make all decisions as far as what we collect . mera : you can call it a family affair . let 's talk about neo rauch , who is turning 50 on april 18 .
why did you start collecting his works ? don : that 's an easy one .
he 's a great artist . so you saw his works and instantly knew … this is it ?
this is the one to buy ? don : with neo rauch it was sort of an odd thing because we saw his work early , early , early - like in ' 94 or ' 96 .
we liked it very much and thought about it , and followed it .
and the work became stronger and stronger .
and i guess it was around 2000 that we bought our first piece . mera : we were traveling to berlin after the wall came down , and someone said , ' you gotta check out what is going on in leipzig . '
so we went , and there is just a huge , old tradition of painting in that academy . what did rauch 's work mean to you when you saw it ? mera : somehow neo rauch was able to deliver a kind of history painting of a moment that passed , that had the psychological power of a time gone , and make it relevant today . don : it 's a combination of fantasy , surrealism and history .
but whether the exact history exists , or whether the imagination constructs the history , does n't matter .
the tone of the paintings is more historical than the fact of the paintings . mera : exactly !
it 's not like he 's telling you a specific story .
his paintings take you into some sort of psychological space , and what makes them powerful is that the psychological space almost bridges the place of history and present - and the future , really . he 's quite a master .
he has this ability with color , with figure , with drama .
these paintings are kind of stage paintings , a kind of storytelling .
and you can take that story into your own personal imagination . bildunterschrift : rauch 's works are ' a kind of storytelling that you can take into your imagination , ' mera rubell says rauch has been called the first german painter to bridge east and west germany … don : the impression of east germany is achieved more through his palette than his choice of subject matter .
so that the colors are reminiscent of some historical past , whereas his subject matter is almost timeless . the leipzig school painters became successful in the us , before they really got off the ground in germany . why is that ? don : i think that collectors of his work were not necessarily american but were very international .
and in a certain sense , this is how it goes .
it 's always difficult to deal with things close to home .
you find most of the great american pop art collections are in germany , for example . mera : i think it 's always dangerous to hold it against an artist for becoming quickly accepted .
i think europeans are much more comfortable with a long , slow-developing situation and career .
perhaps our enthusiasm put some people off . -lsb- with the traveling exhibit ' life after death ' -rsb- there was so much excitement around seeing the work in america , because it was a window into these very , very skillful painters , with of course neo being the master .
and no matter how much we want to walk away from trained classical painters , we ca n't .
it 's a love affair that will never , ever end . i have read that some of the leipzig school painters are unhappy with the moniker they were given .
they reject the idea that they are part of any school .
is that so ? don : you know , when pop art first became popular , all of the artists loved the moniker , because collectors would say , ' i 'd like to have pop art . '
as each of the artists became well known in their own right , they wanted the individuality of not being part of a group .
and in a sense you are dealing with the same thing here .
ultimately , each artist wants his or her own individuality . you 've said that when you first saw rauch 's work , around 1996 , he jumped out at you as ' someone to watch . '
what was his status at that time ?
was he already established , or young and struggling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's works combine a historical look with psychological pull don : the italians have a wonderful expression , ne carne ne pesce - neither fish nor fowl .
he was n't an international art star - no gallery in new york was even looking at him at that time .
but he clearly was way beyond the student stage . what would you say to someone who went to a neo rauch exhibition and found the work to be inscrutable and even frustrating , because they could n't figure out what the paintings were supposed to be about ? don : that 's a very good working definition of good contemporary art .
because what you always want to look for in all of the best young art is art that makes you slightly uncomfortable , and that deals with something you do n't understand .
and that gradually over a period of time , it becomes incorporated into your own essence . this is what happens with neo rauch .
i do n't know to this day what exactly they are about .
i just know they are powerful paintings .
the reason you do n't understand the painting is because no one has been able to determine the narrative of the painting .
so , drop the narrative - the narrative is not given to you . mera : but that 's how art is !
look , there is so much information in the world that gives you the answer .
most communication in the world today has the answer because people usually want you to buy something .
or do something .
or vote for somebody .
the answer is given to you .
most great art - the really good artists - are basically letting you in to their personal , mental space .
it 's not giving you any answers .
i think the artist is as disturbed by what he 's painting as you might be .
and you are !
i am too . it 's the magic and the mystery of painting .
it goes off into the far reaches of our imaginations and has no answers .

they have collected steadily ever since , traveling the globe to acquire contemporary art works that appeal to their personal aesthetic . the rubell family collection now operates as a private museum and educational institution in miami , florida .
the collection today comprises more than 5,000 works .
it is housed in a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 45,000-square-foot -rrb- public space with a vast library , rotating exhibitions from the collection , and traveling exhibits that tour major museums throughout the us and abroad . the rubells were among the earliest proponents of neo rauch 's work .
they were " amazed ” by his paintings when they first saw his work at the liste young art fair in basel , switzerland , about a decade ago and bought their first work by rauch - ' das neue ' - in 2000 .
they later collected a number of paintings by rauch and other members of what would eventually be dubbed the leipzig school .
the rubells ' art foundation sponsored an exhibit of these combined works entitled “ life after death , ” which traveled to six us museums between 2004 and 2008 . deutsche welle spoke to the rubells just hours before they were due to fly to germany to celebrate the back-to-back openings of rauch exhibitions in leipzig -lrb- april 18 -rrb- and munich -lrb- april 20 -rrb- in honor of the artist 's 50th birthday . deutsche welle : don and mera rubell , can you tell me a little bit about your collection ?
who decides what you buy ? mera rubell : we 've been collecting art since we got married , 46 years ago .
we started with a working couple 's budget - i was a teacher and don was in medical school .
its been a relentless pursuit of contemporary art starting from the moment we got together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : don and mera rubell have been passionate collectors for 46 years don rubell : to answer your question , we do it ourselves .
now our son and daughter are very involved , so it 's the four of us who make all decisions as far as what we collect . mera : you can call it a family affair . let 's talk about neo rauch , who is turning 50 on april 18 .
why did you start collecting his works ? don : that 's an easy one .
he 's a great artist . so you saw his works and instantly knew … this is it ?
this is the one to buy ? don : with neo rauch it was sort of an odd thing because we saw his work early , early , early - like in ' 94 or ' 96 .
we liked it very much and thought about it , and followed it .
and the work became stronger and stronger .
and i guess it was around 2000 that we bought our first piece . mera : we were traveling to berlin after the wall came down , and someone said , ' you gotta check out what is going on in leipzig . '
so we went , and there is just a huge , old tradition of painting in that academy . what did rauch 's work mean to you when you saw it ? mera : somehow neo rauch was able to deliver a kind of history painting of a moment that passed , that had the psychological power of a time gone , and make it relevant today . don : it 's a combination of fantasy , surrealism and history .
but whether the exact history exists , or whether the imagination constructs the history , does n't matter .
the tone of the paintings is more historical than the fact of the paintings . mera : exactly !
it 's not like he 's telling you a specific story .
his paintings take you into some sort of psychological space , and what makes them powerful is that the psychological space almost bridges the place of history and present - and the future , really . he 's quite a master .
he has this ability with color , with figure , with drama .
these paintings are kind of stage paintings , a kind of storytelling .
and you can take that story into your own personal imagination . bildunterschrift : rauch 's works are ' a kind of storytelling that you can take into your imagination , ' mera rubell says rauch has been called the first german painter to bridge east and west germany … don : the impression of east germany is achieved more through his palette than his choice of subject matter .
so that the colors are reminiscent of some historical past , whereas his subject matter is almost timeless . the leipzig school painters became successful in the us , before they really got off the ground in germany . why is that ? don : i think that collectors of his work were not necessarily american but were very international .
and in a certain sense , this is how it goes .
it 's always difficult to deal with things close to home .
you find most of the great american pop art collections are in germany , for example . mera : i think it 's always dangerous to hold it against an artist for becoming quickly accepted .
i think europeans are much more comfortable with a long , slow-developing situation and career .
perhaps our enthusiasm put some people off . -lsb- with the traveling exhibit ' life after death ' -rsb- there was so much excitement around seeing the work in america , because it was a window into these very , very skillful painters , with of course neo being the master .
and no matter how much we want to walk away from trained classical painters , we ca n't .
it 's a love affair that will never , ever end . i have read that some of the leipzig school painters are unhappy with the moniker they were given .
they reject the idea that they are part of any school .
is that so ? don : you know , when pop art first became popular , all of the artists loved the moniker , because collectors would say , ' i 'd like to have pop art . '
as each of the artists became well known in their own right , they wanted the individuality of not being part of a group .
and in a sense you are dealing with the same thing here .
ultimately , each artist wants his or her own individuality . you 've said that when you first saw rauch 's work , around 1996 , he jumped out at you as ' someone to watch . '
what was his status at that time ?
was he already established , or young and struggling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's works combine a historical look with psychological pull don : the italians have a wonderful expression , ne carne ne pesce - neither fish nor fowl .
he was n't an international art star - no gallery in new york was even looking at him at that time .
but he clearly was way beyond the student stage . what would you say to someone who went to a neo rauch exhibition and found the work to be inscrutable and even frustrating , because they could n't figure out what the paintings were supposed to be about ? don : that 's a very good working definition of good contemporary art .
because what you always want to look for in all of the best young art is art that makes you slightly uncomfortable , and that deals with something you do n't understand .
and that gradually over a period of time , it becomes incorporated into your own essence . this is what happens with neo rauch .
i do n't know to this day what exactly they are about .
i just know they are powerful paintings .
the reason you do n't understand the painting is because no one has been able to determine the narrative of the painting .
so , drop the narrative - the narrative is not given to you . mera : but that 's how art is !
look , there is so much information in the world that gives you the answer .
most communication in the world today has the answer because people usually want you to buy something .
or do something .
or vote for somebody .
the answer is given to you .
most great art - the really good artists - are basically letting you in to their personal , mental space .
it 's not giving you any answers .
i think the artist is as disturbed by what he 's painting as you might be .
and you are !
i am too . it 's the magic and the mystery of painting .
it goes off into the far reaches of our imaginations and has no answers .
but it certainly engages us emotionally . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they have collected steadily ever since , traveling the globe to acquire contemporary art works that appeal to their personal aesthetic . the rubell family collection now operates as a private museum and educational institution in miami , florida .
the collection today comprises more than 5,000 works .
it is housed in a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 45,000-square-foot -rrb- public space with a vast library , rotating exhibitions from the collection , and traveling exhibits that tour major museums throughout the us and abroad . the rubells were among the earliest proponents of neo rauch 's work .
they were " amazed ” by his paintings when they first saw his work at the liste young art fair in basel , switzerland , about a decade ago and bought their first work by rauch - ' das neue ' - in 2000 .
they later collected a number of paintings by rauch and other members of what would eventually be dubbed the leipzig school .
the rubells ' art foundation sponsored an exhibit of these combined works entitled “ life after death , ” which traveled to six us museums between 2004 and 2008 . deutsche welle spoke to the rubells just hours before they were due to fly to germany to celebrate the back-to-back openings of rauch exhibitions in leipzig -lrb- april 18 -rrb- and munich -lrb- april 20 -rrb- in honor of the artist 's 50th birthday . deutsche welle : don and mera rubell , can you tell me a little bit about your collection ?
who decides what you buy ? mera rubell : we 've been collecting art since we got married , 46 years ago .
we started with a working couple 's budget - i was a teacher and don was in medical school .
its been a relentless pursuit of contemporary art starting from the moment we got together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : don and mera rubell have been passionate collectors for 46 years don rubell : to answer your question , we do it ourselves .
now our son and daughter are very involved , so it 's the four of us who make all decisions as far as what we collect . mera : you can call it a family affair . let 's talk about neo rauch , who is turning 50 on april 18 .
why did you start collecting his works ? don : that 's an easy one .
he 's a great artist . so you saw his works and instantly knew … this is it ?
this is the one to buy ? don : with neo rauch it was sort of an odd thing because we saw his work early , early , early - like in ' 94 or ' 96 .
we liked it very much and thought about it , and followed it .
and the work became stronger and stronger .
and i guess it was around 2000 that we bought our first piece . mera : we were traveling to berlin after the wall came down , and someone said , ' you gotta check out what is going on in leipzig . '
so we went , and there is just a huge , old tradition of painting in that academy . what did rauch 's work mean to you when you saw it ? mera : somehow neo rauch was able to deliver a kind of history painting of a moment that passed , that had the psychological power of a time gone , and make it relevant today . don : it 's a combination of fantasy , surrealism and history .
but whether the exact history exists , or whether the imagination constructs the history , does n't matter .
the tone of the paintings is more historical than the fact of the paintings . mera : exactly !
it 's not like he 's telling you a specific story .
his paintings take you into some sort of psychological space , and what makes them powerful is that the psychological space almost bridges the place of history and present - and the future , really . he 's quite a master .
he has this ability with color , with figure , with drama .
these paintings are kind of stage paintings , a kind of storytelling .
and you can take that story into your own personal imagination . bildunterschrift : rauch 's works are ' a kind of storytelling that you can take into your imagination , ' mera rubell says rauch has been called the first german painter to bridge east and west germany … don : the impression of east germany is achieved more through his palette than his choice of subject matter .
so that the colors are reminiscent of some historical past , whereas his subject matter is almost timeless . the leipzig school painters became successful in the us , before they really got off the ground in germany . why is that ? don : i think that collectors of his work were not necessarily american but were very international .
and in a certain sense , this is how it goes .
it 's always difficult to deal with things close to home .
you find most of the great american pop art collections are in germany , for example . mera : i think it 's always dangerous to hold it against an artist for becoming quickly accepted .
i think europeans are much more comfortable with a long , slow-developing situation and career .
perhaps our enthusiasm put some people off . -lsb- with the traveling exhibit ' life after death ' -rsb- there was so much excitement around seeing the work in america , because it was a window into these very , very skillful painters , with of course neo being the master .
and no matter how much we want to walk away from trained classical painters , we ca n't .
it 's a love affair that will never , ever end . i have read that some of the leipzig school painters are unhappy with the moniker they were given .
they reject the idea that they are part of any school .
is that so ? don : you know , when pop art first became popular , all of the artists loved the moniker , because collectors would say , ' i 'd like to have pop art . '
as each of the artists became well known in their own right , they wanted the individuality of not being part of a group .
and in a sense you are dealing with the same thing here .
ultimately , each artist wants his or her own individuality . you 've said that when you first saw rauch 's work , around 1996 , he jumped out at you as ' someone to watch . '
what was his status at that time ?
was he already established , or young and struggling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's works combine a historical look with psychological pull don : the italians have a wonderful expression , ne carne ne pesce - neither fish nor fowl .
he was n't an international art star - no gallery in new york was even looking at him at that time .
but he clearly was way beyond the student stage . what would you say to someone who went to a neo rauch exhibition and found the work to be inscrutable and even frustrating , because they could n't figure out what the paintings were supposed to be about ? don : that 's a very good working definition of good contemporary art .
because what you always want to look for in all of the best young art is art that makes you slightly uncomfortable , and that deals with something you do n't understand .
and that gradually over a period of time , it becomes incorporated into your own essence . this is what happens with neo rauch .
i do n't know to this day what exactly they are about .
i just know they are powerful paintings .
the reason you do n't understand the painting is because no one has been able to determine the narrative of the painting .
so , drop the narrative - the narrative is not given to you . mera : but that 's how art is !
look , there is so much information in the world that gives you the answer .
most communication in the world today has the answer because people usually want you to buy something .

was he already established , or young and struggling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's works combine a historical look with psychological pull don : the italians have a wonderful expression , ne carne ne pesce - neither fish nor fowl .
he was n't an international art star - no gallery in new york was even looking at him at that time .
but he clearly was way beyond the student stage . what would you say to someone who went to a neo rauch exhibition and found the work to be inscrutable and even frustrating , because they could n't figure out what the paintings were supposed to be about ? don : that 's a very good working definition of good contemporary art .
because what you always want to look for in all of the best young art is art that makes you slightly uncomfortable , and that deals with something you do n't understand .
and that gradually over a period of time , it becomes incorporated into your own essence . this is what happens with neo rauch .
i do n't know to this day what exactly they are about .
i just know they are powerful paintings .
the reason you do n't understand the painting is because no one has been able to determine the narrative of the painting .
so , drop the narrative - the narrative is not given to you . mera : but that 's how art is !
look , there is so much information in the world that gives you the answer .
most communication in the world today has the answer because people usually want you to buy something .
or do something .
or vote for somebody .
the answer is given to you .
most great art - the really good artists - are basically letting you in to their personal , mental space .
it 's not giving you any answers .
i think the artist is as disturbed by what he 's painting as you might be .
and you are !
i am too . it 's the magic and the mystery of painting .
it goes off into the far reaches of our imaginations and has no answers .
but it certainly engages us emotionally . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the memorial for the four germans killed last thursday in a rocket attack was held at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- headquarters in mazar-i-sharif .
some 1,500 soldiers from 19 different countries attended .
the bodies were supposed to be flown back to germany earlier in the weekend , but the volcanic ash cloud that has disrupted european air travel in recent days forced the transport to be delayed .
a funeral in southern germany is planned for friday , but the exact date and time are unclear . germany 's national inspector of the armed forces , volker wieker , told the crowd that public debate about german troops ' participation in the afghan mission " should and will not be allowed to stand in the way of our security and the will of the afghan people . "
wieker said continued debate would play into the taliban 's strategy to weaken german resolve to stay in afghanistan .
the four dead all came from southern germany : a 33-year-old from ulm , a 28-year-old from weiden , and two 24 and 32-year old soldiers from ingolstadt .
five other soldiers were severely injured in the attack and evacuated to istanbul , where they are being treated in a us military hospital until they can be flown to germany .
the condition of two soldiers is still so serious that they could n't yet be transported , but a defense ministry spokesman said their condition was stable .

the maltese men who claimed they were abused by priests while living in an orphanage had requested a private meeting with the pope .
earlier on sunday , his second day in malta , the pope celebrated an open air mass in malta 's biggest square .
church officials estimated up to 10,000 people attended despite heavy rain showers . during his addresss , benedict praised malta 's opposition to divorce and urged followers in the heavily catholic nation to uphold their faith .
" at every moment of our lives we depend entirely on god , " the pope told those gathered .
no comment until the meeting with the abuse victims , the pontiff had not commented directly on the allegations that the church covered up for priests who molested minors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch has said that the german church stands behind the pope " these meetings are never announced beforehand , " the pope 's spokesman , federico lombardi , told reporters .
but malta 's top archbishop , paul cremona , was more critical . " we can not just cling to the model of the church to which we have been accustomed for decades , " cremona said as he opened the papal mass .
he did not directly mention the scandal but said the " church must be humble enough to recognize the failures and sins of its members . "
top german bishop supports pope but a top bishop in benedict 's native germany offered benedikt his " unreserved solidarity " as the pontiff marks the fifth anniversary of his election .
archbishop robert zollitsch , the head of the german bishops ' conference , wrote in a congratulatory letter that the pope could rely on the german church 's " full support . "
the pope is expected to hold a meeting with thousands of young catholics and take a harbor ride before returning to rome on sunday evening. smh / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

superior strategic calls early on helped mercedes ' nico rosberg claim third place . jenson button has won his second race of the 2010 formula one season , coming from fifth on the grid in difficult , changeable weather conditions .
as in australia earlier this year , button 's victory was partly thanks to him keeping cool in the treacherous weather and being on the right kind of tires at the right time .
button - who many believed could struggle in his new mercedes-powered mclaren against the highly-fancied 2008 champion lewis hamilton - is now ten points clear of the pack in the overall driver 's standings , having led the field all season long last year .
" this win is something very special , and it really means a lot to me , " button said in the post-race press conference .
" all in all , i am very happy with the team 's progress too .
we made another big step in the right direction today . "
the mclaren-mercedes driver , faced with the nightmarish situation of drizzle beginning to fall moments before the race began , elected to struggle round on dry weather tires and wait to see if the rain set in .
meanwhile , the enormous majority of the field hit the panic button and dove straight into the pits for wet weather tires . bildunterschrift : it was reigning champion jenson button who managed to handle the difficult conditions best the rain soon abated .
button , nico rosberg and the renault drivers robert kubica and vitaly petrov sauntered off into the distance , as the rest of the field eventually had to pit again - losing more time - to go back to dry tires .
in this early phase of the race in shanghai , button hunted down and overtook the early leader nico rosberg - whose mercedes gp car was no match for the mclaren , especially in terms of straight-line speed .
once in front , he was never challenged .
mercedes engines dominate button 's teammate lewis hamilton also managed to climb the ranks and overtake rosberg during the course of the race , but the young german - whose result puts him second in the title behind button - felt had got the best result his car could deliver on the day .
" i 'm extremely happy , this is a super result for us , " rosberg said after the race .
" it was a crazy race in really difficult conditions .
the key to success was the opening phase , when the team and i decided to stay on dry tires .
i stayed out on track , just thinking : ' please , please do n't rain any more ! '
luckily the rain did n't get heavier , so i was able to keep up a good pace and lead the way in the early stages . "
rosberg is still seeking his maiden victory in formula one .
" if you had offered me third position coming into this race , i would have taken it , " mercedes ' motorsport director norbert haug said on german television , also pointing out that the two mclarens ahead purchase their engines from mercedes .
" i would n't have really expected nico to be second overall after four races , it 's fantastic .
the championship is wide open , and we are certainly in the race . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel was unable to build on his pole position disappointment for vettel pole-sitter sebastian vettel was one of many drivers to lose out in the opening chaos .
to make matters worse , vettel lost out to his teammate mark webber into turn one , meaning that when both red bull cars simultaneously pitted at the first opportunity , not only did vettel put on tires that turned out to be the wrong choice for the conditions , he had to queue behind webber for the privilege of doing so , losing even more places .

12 months ago on a wet track in shanghai , he provided his red bull team with their first ever f1 win .
" we could have lost a lot more today , " he later reflected . vettel could have crashed at one stage as he battled into and out of the pit lane with eventual second place finisher lewis hamilton .
the racing incident was investigated ; both drivers received a reprimand but not a penalty .

michael schumacher was the third german driver to finish in the points in shanghai , coming home in tenth place .
however , the multiple champion was almost a minute adrift of his teammate nico rosberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking grim for schumi 's return to f1 once dubbed the " regenmeister " -lrb- rain master -rrb- because of peerless performances in wet conditions in his heyday , the 41-year-old 's lackluster display - especially in the latter stages - have increased speculation that he may never recapture his best form .
" to be honest , this whole weekend was a disappointment to me , and disappointing from me , " schumacher lamented .
" i just have to write it off , try to learn for it , and concentrate on the next race in barcelona in three weeks time . "
schumacher 's mercedes team - like many others around the grid - were planning to use the three week break before the spanish grand prix to introduce a major package of performance upgrades for their car . but with european air travel still in chaos because of the volcanic eruption in iceland , the first item on the agenda for the teams right now is shipping their current cars back to europe in time for the next race .

superior strategic calls early on helped mercedes ' nico rosberg claim third place . jenson button has won his second race of the 2010 formula one season , coming from fifth on the grid in difficult , changeable weather conditions .
as in australia earlier this year , button 's victory was partly thanks to him keeping cool in the treacherous weather and being on the right kind of tires at the right time .
button - who many believed could struggle in his new mercedes-powered mclaren against the highly-fancied 2008 champion lewis hamilton - is now ten points clear of the pack in the overall driver 's standings , having led the field all season long last year .
" this win is something very special , and it really means a lot to me , " button said in the post-race press conference .
" all in all , i am very happy with the team 's progress too .
we made another big step in the right direction today . "
the mclaren-mercedes driver , faced with the nightmarish situation of drizzle beginning to fall moments before the race began , elected to struggle round on dry weather tires and wait to see if the rain set in .
meanwhile , the enormous majority of the field hit the panic button and dove straight into the pits for wet weather tires . bildunterschrift : it was reigning champion jenson button who managed to handle the difficult conditions best the rain soon abated .
button , nico rosberg and the renault drivers robert kubica and vitaly petrov sauntered off into the distance , as the rest of the field eventually had to pit again - losing more time - to go back to dry tires .
in this early phase of the race in shanghai , button hunted down and overtook the early leader nico rosberg - whose mercedes gp car was no match for the mclaren , especially in terms of straight-line speed .
once in front , he was never challenged .
mercedes engines dominate button 's teammate lewis hamilton also managed to climb the ranks and overtake rosberg during the course of the race , but the young german - whose result puts him second in the title behind button - felt had got the best result his car could deliver on the day .
" i 'm extremely happy , this is a super result for us , " rosberg said after the race .
" it was a crazy race in really difficult conditions .
the key to success was the opening phase , when the team and i decided to stay on dry tires .
i stayed out on track , just thinking : ' please , please do n't rain any more ! '
luckily the rain did n't get heavier , so i was able to keep up a good pace and lead the way in the early stages . "
rosberg is still seeking his maiden victory in formula one .
" if you had offered me third position coming into this race , i would have taken it , " mercedes ' motorsport director norbert haug said on german television , also pointing out that the two mclarens ahead purchase their engines from mercedes .
" i would n't have really expected nico to be second overall after four races , it 's fantastic .
the championship is wide open , and we are certainly in the race . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel was unable to build on his pole position disappointment for vettel pole-sitter sebastian vettel was one of many drivers to lose out in the opening chaos .
to make matters worse , vettel lost out to his teammate mark webber into turn one , meaning that when both red bull cars simultaneously pitted at the first opportunity , not only did vettel put on tires that turned out to be the wrong choice for the conditions , he had to queue behind webber for the privilege of doing so , losing even more places .
" that really ca n't be helped , " vettel said after the race .
" he -lrb- webber -rrb- got the place off the start line .
i need to work out why my start was n't as good as his , but that 's just the plight of the second-placed car .
in that situation , you have to wait in the pits . "
vettel showed great speed during the race , and eventually clawed his way back up to sixth position .
12 months ago on a wet track in shanghai , he provided his red bull team with their first ever f1 win .
" we could have lost a lot more today , " he later reflected . vettel could have crashed at one stage as he battled into and out of the pit lane with eventual second place finisher lewis hamilton .
the racing incident was investigated ; both drivers received a reprimand but not a penalty .
past his prime ?
michael schumacher was the third german driver to finish in the points in shanghai , coming home in tenth place .
however , the multiple champion was almost a minute adrift of his teammate nico rosberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking grim for schumi 's return to f1 once dubbed the " regenmeister " -lrb- rain master -rrb- because of peerless performances in wet conditions in his heyday , the 41-year-old 's lackluster display - especially in the latter stages - have increased speculation that he may never recapture his best form .
" to be honest , this whole weekend was a disappointment to me , and disappointing from me , " schumacher lamented .
" i just have to write it off , try to learn for it , and concentrate on the next race in barcelona in three weeks time . "
schumacher 's mercedes team - like many others around the grid - were planning to use the three week break before the spanish grand prix to introduce a major package of performance upgrades for their car . but with european air travel still in chaos because of the volcanic eruption in iceland , the first item on the agenda for the teams right now is shipping their current cars back to europe in time for the next race .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 18.04.2010 jenson button leads mercedes-powered podium in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wet weather and safety car periods transformed the race f1 world champion jenson button has won the chinese grand prix in shanghai , ahead of his mclaren teammate lewis hamilton .
superior strategic calls early on helped mercedes ' nico rosberg claim third place . jenson button has won his second race of the 2010 formula one season , coming from fifth on the grid in difficult , changeable weather conditions .
as in australia earlier this year , button 's victory was partly thanks to him keeping cool in the treacherous weather and being on the right kind of tires at the right time .
button - who many believed could struggle in his new mercedes-powered mclaren against the highly-fancied 2008 champion lewis hamilton - is now ten points clear of the pack in the overall driver 's standings , having led the field all season long last year .
" this win is something very special , and it really means a lot to me , " button said in the post-race press conference .
" all in all , i am very happy with the team 's progress too .
we made another big step in the right direction today . "
the mclaren-mercedes driver , faced with the nightmarish situation of drizzle beginning to fall moments before the race began , elected to struggle round on dry weather tires and wait to see if the rain set in .
meanwhile , the enormous majority of the field hit the panic button and dove straight into the pits for wet weather tires . bildunterschrift : it was reigning champion jenson button who managed to handle the difficult conditions best the rain soon abated .
button , nico rosberg and the renault drivers robert kubica and vitaly petrov sauntered off into the distance , as the rest of the field eventually had to pit again - losing more time - to go back to dry tires .
in this early phase of the race in shanghai , button hunted down and overtook the early leader nico rosberg - whose mercedes gp car was no match for the mclaren , especially in terms of straight-line speed .
once in front , he was never challenged .
mercedes engines dominate button 's teammate lewis hamilton also managed to climb the ranks and overtake rosberg during the course of the race , but the young german - whose result puts him second in the title behind button - felt had got the best result his car could deliver on the day .
" i 'm extremely happy , this is a super result for us , " rosberg said after the race .
" it was a crazy race in really difficult conditions .
the key to success was the opening phase , when the team and i decided to stay on dry tires .
i stayed out on track , just thinking : ' please , please do n't rain any more ! '
luckily the rain did n't get heavier , so i was able to keep up a good pace and lead the way in the early stages . "
rosberg is still seeking his maiden victory in formula one .
" if you had offered me third position coming into this race , i would have taken it , " mercedes ' motorsport director norbert haug said on german television , also pointing out that the two mclarens ahead purchase their engines from mercedes .
" i would n't have really expected nico to be second overall after four races , it 's fantastic .
the championship is wide open , and we are certainly in the race . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel was unable to build on his pole position disappointment for vettel pole-sitter sebastian vettel was one of many drivers to lose out in the opening chaos .
to make matters worse , vettel lost out to his teammate mark webber into turn one , meaning that when both red bull cars simultaneously pitted at the first opportunity , not only did vettel put on tires that turned out to be the wrong choice for the conditions , he had to queue behind webber for the privilege of doing so , losing even more places .
" that really ca n't be helped , " vettel said after the race .
" he -lrb- webber -rrb- got the place off the start line .
i need to work out why my start was n't as good as his , but that 's just the plight of the second-placed car .
in that situation , you have to wait in the pits . "
vettel showed great speed during the race , and eventually clawed his way back up to sixth position .
12 months ago on a wet track in shanghai , he provided his red bull team with their first ever f1 win .
" we could have lost a lot more today , " he later reflected . vettel could have crashed at one stage as he battled into and out of the pit lane with eventual second place finisher lewis hamilton .
the racing incident was investigated ; both drivers received a reprimand but not a penalty .
past his prime ?
michael schumacher was the third german driver to finish in the points in shanghai , coming home in tenth place .
however , the multiple champion was almost a minute adrift of his teammate nico rosberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking grim for schumi 's return to f1 once dubbed the " regenmeister " -lrb- rain master -rrb- because of peerless performances in wet conditions in his heyday , the 41-year-old 's lackluster display - especially in the latter stages - have increased speculation that he may never recapture his best form .
" to be honest , this whole weekend was a disappointment to me , and disappointing from me , " schumacher lamented .
" i just have to write it off , try to learn for it , and concentrate on the next race in barcelona in three weeks time . "
schumacher 's mercedes team - like many others around the grid - were planning to use the three week break before the spanish grand prix to introduce a major package of performance upgrades for their car . but with european air travel still in chaos because of the volcanic eruption in iceland , the first item on the agenda for the teams right now is shipping their current cars back to europe in time for the next race .
some outfits say they have been looking into alternative freight options using boats or trains , in case they ca n't fly the equipment back as usual .

the maltese men who claimed they were abused by priests while living in an orphanage had requested a private meeting with the pope .
earlier on sunday , his second day in malta , the pope celebrated an open air mass in malta 's biggest square .
church officials estimated up to 10,000 people attended despite heavy rain showers . during his addresss , benedict praised malta 's opposition to divorce and urged followers in the heavily catholic nation to uphold their faith .
" at every moment of our lives we depend entirely on god , " the pope told those gathered .
no comment until the meeting with the abuse victims , the pontiff had not commented directly on the allegations that the church covered up for priests who molested minors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch has said that the german church stands behind the pope " these meetings are never announced beforehand , " the pope 's spokesman , federico lombardi , told reporters .
but malta 's top archbishop , paul cremona , was more critical . " we can not just cling to the model of the church to which we have been accustomed for decades , " cremona said as he opened the papal mass .
he did not directly mention the scandal but said the " church must be humble enough to recognize the failures and sins of its members . "
top german bishop supports pope but a top bishop in benedict 's native germany offered benedikt his " unreserved solidarity " as the pontiff marks the fifth anniversary of his election .
archbishop robert zollitsch , the head of the german bishops ' conference , wrote in a congratulatory letter that the pope could rely on the german church 's " full support . "

he did not directly mention the scandal but said the " church must be humble enough to recognize the failures and sins of its members . "
top german bishop supports pope but a top bishop in benedict 's native germany offered benedikt his " unreserved solidarity " as the pontiff marks the fifth anniversary of his election .
archbishop robert zollitsch , the head of the german bishops ' conference , wrote in a congratulatory letter that the pope could rely on the german church 's " full support . "

they have collected steadily ever since , traveling the globe to acquire contemporary art works that appeal to their personal aesthetic . the rubell family collection now operates as a private museum and educational institution in miami , florida .
the collection today comprises more than 5,000 works .
it is housed in a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 45,000-square-foot -rrb- public space with a vast library , rotating exhibitions from the collection , and traveling exhibits that tour major museums throughout the us and abroad . the rubells were among the earliest proponents of neo rauch 's work .
they were " amazed ” by his paintings when they first saw his work at the liste young art fair in basel , switzerland , about a decade ago and bought their first work by rauch - ' das neue ' - in 2000 .
they later collected a number of paintings by rauch and other members of what would eventually be dubbed the leipzig school .
the rubells ' art foundation sponsored an exhibit of these combined works entitled “ life after death , ” which traveled to six us museums between 2004 and 2008 . deutsche welle spoke to the rubells just hours before they were due to fly to germany to celebrate the back-to-back openings of rauch exhibitions in leipzig -lrb- april 18 -rrb- and munich -lrb- april 20 -rrb- in honor of the artist 's 50th birthday . deutsche welle : don and mera rubell , can you tell me a little bit about your collection ?
who decides what you buy ? mera rubell : we 've been collecting art since we got married , 46 years ago .
we started with a working couple 's budget - i was a teacher and don was in medical school .
its been a relentless pursuit of contemporary art starting from the moment we got together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : don and mera rubell have been passionate collectors for 46 years don rubell : to answer your question , we do it ourselves .
now our son and daughter are very involved , so it 's the four of us who make all decisions as far as what we collect . mera : you can call it a family affair . let 's talk about neo rauch , who is turning 50 on april 18 .
why did you start collecting his works ? don : that 's an easy one .
he 's a great artist . so you saw his works and instantly knew … this is it ?
this is the one to buy ? don : with neo rauch it was sort of an odd thing because we saw his work early , early , early - like in ' 94 or ' 96 .
we liked it very much and thought about it , and followed it .
and the work became stronger and stronger .
and i guess it was around 2000 that we bought our first piece . mera : we were traveling to berlin after the wall came down , and someone said , ' you gotta check out what is going on in leipzig . '
so we went , and there is just a huge , old tradition of painting in that academy . what did rauch 's work mean to you when you saw it ? mera : somehow neo rauch was able to deliver a kind of history painting of a moment that passed , that had the psychological power of a time gone , and make it relevant today . don : it 's a combination of fantasy , surrealism and history .
but whether the exact history exists , or whether the imagination constructs the history , does n't matter .
the tone of the paintings is more historical than the fact of the paintings . mera : exactly !
it 's not like he 's telling you a specific story .
his paintings take you into some sort of psychological space , and what makes them powerful is that the psychological space almost bridges the place of history and present - and the future , really . he 's quite a master .
he has this ability with color , with figure , with drama .
these paintings are kind of stage paintings , a kind of storytelling .
and you can take that story into your own personal imagination . bildunterschrift : rauch 's works are ' a kind of storytelling that you can take into your imagination , ' mera rubell says rauch has been called the first german painter to bridge east and west germany … don : the impression of east germany is achieved more through his palette than his choice of subject matter .
so that the colors are reminiscent of some historical past , whereas his subject matter is almost timeless . the leipzig school painters became successful in the us , before they really got off the ground in germany . why is that ? don : i think that collectors of his work were not necessarily american but were very international .
and in a certain sense , this is how it goes .
it 's always difficult to deal with things close to home .
you find most of the great american pop art collections are in germany , for example . mera : i think it 's always dangerous to hold it against an artist for becoming quickly accepted .
i think europeans are much more comfortable with a long , slow-developing situation and career .
perhaps our enthusiasm put some people off . -lsb- with the traveling exhibit ' life after death ' -rsb- there was so much excitement around seeing the work in america , because it was a window into these very , very skillful painters , with of course neo being the master .
and no matter how much we want to walk away from trained classical painters , we ca n't .
it 's a love affair that will never , ever end . i have read that some of the leipzig school painters are unhappy with the moniker they were given .
they reject the idea that they are part of any school .
is that so ? don : you know , when pop art first became popular , all of the artists loved the moniker , because collectors would say , ' i 'd like to have pop art . '
as each of the artists became well known in their own right , they wanted the individuality of not being part of a group .
and in a sense you are dealing with the same thing here .
ultimately , each artist wants his or her own individuality . you 've said that when you first saw rauch 's work , around 1996 , he jumped out at you as ' someone to watch . '
what was his status at that time ?
was he already established , or young and struggling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's works combine a historical look with psychological pull don : the italians have a wonderful expression , ne carne ne pesce - neither fish nor fowl .
he was n't an international art star - no gallery in new york was even looking at him at that time .
but he clearly was way beyond the student stage . what would you say to someone who went to a neo rauch exhibition and found the work to be inscrutable and even frustrating , because they could n't figure out what the paintings were supposed to be about ? don : that 's a very good working definition of good contemporary art .
because what you always want to look for in all of the best young art is art that makes you slightly uncomfortable , and that deals with something you do n't understand .
and that gradually over a period of time , it becomes incorporated into your own essence . this is what happens with neo rauch .
i do n't know to this day what exactly they are about .
i just know they are powerful paintings .
the reason you do n't understand the painting is because no one has been able to determine the narrative of the painting .
so , drop the narrative - the narrative is not given to you . mera : but that 's how art is !
look , there is so much information in the world that gives you the answer .
most communication in the world today has the answer because people usually want you to buy something .
or do something .
or vote for somebody .
the answer is given to you .
most great art - the really good artists - are basically letting you in to their personal , mental space .
it 's not giving you any answers .
i think the artist is as disturbed by what he 's painting as you might be .
and you are !
i am too . it 's the magic and the mystery of painting .
it goes off into the far reaches of our imaginations and has no answers .
but it certainly engages us emotionally . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huge crowds mourned in front of the church and along the funeral procession route the archbishop of krakow , stanislaw dziwisz , thanked the foreign leaders who came to the service and said he hoped the crash would help end decades of tensions between russia and poland . " the empathy and help that we experienced during these days from our russian brothers raises hope for raprochement and reconciliation , " dziwinsz said .
" these words i direct to the president of russia . " among the leaders unable to attend was german chancellor angela merkel , who was forced to divert a flight back to the west coast of the united states to italy and then travel by armored limousine to get home to berlin .
german president horst koehler attended to mass after arriving to krakow by helicopter . us president barack obama , french president nicolas sarkozy , european commission chairman jose manuel barroso and scores of others also had to cancel their attendance due to the ash cloud ’ s travel disruptions . svs / dpa / ap / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they have collected steadily ever since , traveling the globe to acquire contemporary art works that appeal to their personal aesthetic . the rubell family collection now operates as a private museum and educational institution in miami , florida .
the collection today comprises more than 5,000 works .
it is housed in a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 45,000-square-foot -rrb- public space with a vast library , rotating exhibitions from the collection , and traveling exhibits that tour major museums throughout the us and abroad . the rubells were among the earliest proponents of neo rauch 's work .
they were " amazed ” by his paintings when they first saw his work at the liste young art fair in basel , switzerland , about a decade ago and bought their first work by rauch - ' das neue ' - in 2000 .
they later collected a number of paintings by rauch and other members of what would eventually be dubbed the leipzig school .
the rubells ' art foundation sponsored an exhibit of these combined works entitled “ life after death , ” which traveled to six us museums between 2004 and 2008 . deutsche welle spoke to the rubells just hours before they were due to fly to germany to celebrate the back-to-back openings of rauch exhibitions in leipzig -lrb- april 18 -rrb- and munich -lrb- april 20 -rrb- in honor of the artist 's 50th birthday . deutsche welle : don and mera rubell , can you tell me a little bit about your collection ?
who decides what you buy ? mera rubell : we 've been collecting art since we got married , 46 years ago .
we started with a working couple 's budget - i was a teacher and don was in medical school .
its been a relentless pursuit of contemporary art starting from the moment we got together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : don and mera rubell have been passionate collectors for 46 years don rubell : to answer your question , we do it ourselves .
now our son and daughter are very involved , so it 's the four of us who make all decisions as far as what we collect . mera : you can call it a family affair . let 's talk about neo rauch , who is turning 50 on april 18 .
why did you start collecting his works ? don : that 's an easy one .
he 's a great artist . so you saw his works and instantly knew … this is it ?
this is the one to buy ? don : with neo rauch it was sort of an odd thing because we saw his work early , early , early - like in ' 94 or ' 96 .
we liked it very much and thought about it , and followed it .
and the work became stronger and stronger .
and i guess it was around 2000 that we bought our first piece . mera : we were traveling to berlin after the wall came down , and someone said , ' you gotta check out what is going on in leipzig . '
so we went , and there is just a huge , old tradition of painting in that academy . what did rauch 's work mean to you when you saw it ? mera : somehow neo rauch was able to deliver a kind of history painting of a moment that passed , that had the psychological power of a time gone , and make it relevant today . don : it 's a combination of fantasy , surrealism and history .
but whether the exact history exists , or whether the imagination constructs the history , does n't matter .
the tone of the paintings is more historical than the fact of the paintings . mera : exactly !
it 's not like he 's telling you a specific story .
his paintings take you into some sort of psychological space , and what makes them powerful is that the psychological space almost bridges the place of history and present - and the future , really . he 's quite a master .
he has this ability with color , with figure , with drama .
these paintings are kind of stage paintings , a kind of storytelling .
and you can take that story into your own personal imagination . bildunterschrift : rauch 's works are ' a kind of storytelling that you can take into your imagination , ' mera rubell says rauch has been called the first german painter to bridge east and west germany … don : the impression of east germany is achieved more through his palette than his choice of subject matter .
so that the colors are reminiscent of some historical past , whereas his subject matter is almost timeless . the leipzig school painters became successful in the us , before they really got off the ground in germany . why is that ? don : i think that collectors of his work were not necessarily american but were very international .
and in a certain sense , this is how it goes .
it 's always difficult to deal with things close to home .
you find most of the great american pop art collections are in germany , for example . mera : i think it 's always dangerous to hold it against an artist for becoming quickly accepted .
i think europeans are much more comfortable with a long , slow-developing situation and career .
perhaps our enthusiasm put some people off . -lsb- with the traveling exhibit ' life after death ' -rsb- there was so much excitement around seeing the work in america , because it was a window into these very , very skillful painters , with of course neo being the master .
and no matter how much we want to walk away from trained classical painters , we ca n't .
it 's a love affair that will never , ever end . i have read that some of the leipzig school painters are unhappy with the moniker they were given .
they reject the idea that they are part of any school .
is that so ? don : you know , when pop art first became popular , all of the artists loved the moniker , because collectors would say , ' i 'd like to have pop art . '
as each of the artists became well known in their own right , they wanted the individuality of not being part of a group .
and in a sense you are dealing with the same thing here .
ultimately , each artist wants his or her own individuality . you 've said that when you first saw rauch 's work , around 1996 , he jumped out at you as ' someone to watch . '
what was his status at that time ?
was he already established , or young and struggling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's works combine a historical look with psychological pull don : the italians have a wonderful expression , ne carne ne pesce - neither fish nor fowl .
he was n't an international art star - no gallery in new york was even looking at him at that time .
but he clearly was way beyond the student stage . what would you say to someone who went to a neo rauch exhibition and found the work to be inscrutable and even frustrating , because they could n't figure out what the paintings were supposed to be about ? don : that 's a very good working definition of good contemporary art .
because what you always want to look for in all of the best young art is art that makes you slightly uncomfortable , and that deals with something you do n't understand .
and that gradually over a period of time , it becomes incorporated into your own essence . this is what happens with neo rauch .
i do n't know to this day what exactly they are about .
i just know they are powerful paintings .
the reason you do n't understand the painting is because no one has been able to determine the narrative of the painting .
so , drop the narrative - the narrative is not given to you . mera : but that 's how art is !
look , there is so much information in the world that gives you the answer .
most communication in the world today has the answer because people usually want you to buy something .
or do something .
or vote for somebody .
the answer is given to you .
most great art - the really good artists - are basically letting you in to their personal , mental space .
it 's not giving you any answers .
i think the artist is as disturbed by what he 's painting as you might be .
and you are !
i am too . it 's the magic and the mystery of painting .
it goes off into the far reaches of our imaginations and has no answers .
but it certainly engages us emotionally . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and you can take that story into your own personal imagination . bildunterschrift : rauch 's works are ' a kind of storytelling that you can take into your imagination , ' mera rubell says rauch has been called the first german painter to bridge east and west germany … don : the impression of east germany is achieved more through his palette than his choice of subject matter .
so that the colors are reminiscent of some historical past , whereas his subject matter is almost timeless . the leipzig school painters became successful in the us , before they really got off the ground in germany . why is that ? don : i think that collectors of his work were not necessarily american but were very international .
and in a certain sense , this is how it goes .
it 's always difficult to deal with things close to home .
you find most of the great american pop art collections are in germany , for example . mera : i think it 's always dangerous to hold it against an artist for becoming quickly accepted .
i think europeans are much more comfortable with a long , slow-developing situation and career .
perhaps our enthusiasm put some people off . -lsb- with the traveling exhibit ' life after death ' -rsb- there was so much excitement around seeing the work in america , because it was a window into these very , very skillful painters , with of course neo being the master .
and no matter how much we want to walk away from trained classical painters , we ca n't .
it 's a love affair that will never , ever end . i have read that some of the leipzig school painters are unhappy with the moniker they were given .
they reject the idea that they are part of any school .
is that so ? don : you know , when pop art first became popular , all of the artists loved the moniker , because collectors would say , ' i 'd like to have pop art . '
as each of the artists became well known in their own right , they wanted the individuality of not being part of a group .
and in a sense you are dealing with the same thing here .
ultimately , each artist wants his or her own individuality . you 've said that when you first saw rauch 's work , around 1996 , he jumped out at you as ' someone to watch . '
what was his status at that time ?
was he already established , or young and struggling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's works combine a historical look with psychological pull don : the italians have a wonderful expression , ne carne ne pesce - neither fish nor fowl .
he was n't an international art star - no gallery in new york was even looking at him at that time .
but he clearly was way beyond the student stage . what would you say to someone who went to a neo rauch exhibition and found the work to be inscrutable and even frustrating , because they could n't figure out what the paintings were supposed to be about ? don : that 's a very good working definition of good contemporary art .
because what you always want to look for in all of the best young art is art that makes you slightly uncomfortable , and that deals with something you do n't understand .
and that gradually over a period of time , it becomes incorporated into your own essence . this is what happens with neo rauch .
i do n't know to this day what exactly they are about .
i just know they are powerful paintings .
the reason you do n't understand the painting is because no one has been able to determine the narrative of the painting .
so , drop the narrative - the narrative is not given to you . mera : but that 's how art is !
look , there is so much information in the world that gives you the answer .
most communication in the world today has the answer because people usually want you to buy something .
or do something .
or vote for somebody .
the answer is given to you .
most great art - the really good artists - are basically letting you in to their personal , mental space .
it 's not giving you any answers .
i think the artist is as disturbed by what he 's painting as you might be .
and you are !
i am too . it 's the magic and the mystery of painting .
it goes off into the far reaches of our imaginations and has no answers .
but it certainly engages us emotionally . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 18.04.2010 jenson button leads mercedes-powered podium in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wet weather and safety car periods transformed the race f1 world champion jenson button has won the chinese grand prix in shanghai , ahead of his mclaren teammate lewis hamilton .
superior strategic calls early on helped mercedes ' nico rosberg claim third place . jenson button has won his second race of the 2010 formula one season , coming from fifth on the grid in difficult , changeable weather conditions .
as in australia earlier this year , button 's victory was partly thanks to him keeping cool in the treacherous weather and being on the right kind of tires at the right time .
button - who many believed could struggle in his new mercedes-powered mclaren against the highly-fancied 2008 champion lewis hamilton - is now ten points clear of the pack in the overall driver 's standings , having led the field all season long last year .
" this win is something very special , and it really means a lot to me , " button said in the post-race press conference .
" all in all , i am very happy with the team 's progress too .
we made another big step in the right direction today . "
the mclaren-mercedes driver , faced with the nightmarish situation of drizzle beginning to fall moments before the race began , elected to struggle round on dry weather tires and wait to see if the rain set in .
meanwhile , the enormous majority of the field hit the panic button and dove straight into the pits for wet weather tires . bildunterschrift : it was reigning champion jenson button who managed to handle the difficult conditions best the rain soon abated .
button , nico rosberg and the renault drivers robert kubica and vitaly petrov sauntered off into the distance , as the rest of the field eventually had to pit again - losing more time - to go back to dry tires .
in this early phase of the race in shanghai , button hunted down and overtook the early leader nico rosberg - whose mercedes gp car was no match for the mclaren , especially in terms of straight-line speed .
once in front , he was never challenged .
mercedes engines dominate button 's teammate lewis hamilton also managed to climb the ranks and overtake rosberg during the course of the race , but the young german - whose result puts him second in the title behind button - felt had got the best result his car could deliver on the day .
" i 'm extremely happy , this is a super result for us , " rosberg said after the race .
" it was a crazy race in really difficult conditions .
the key to success was the opening phase , when the team and i decided to stay on dry tires .
i stayed out on track , just thinking : ' please , please do n't rain any more ! '
luckily the rain did n't get heavier , so i was able to keep up a good pace and lead the way in the early stages . "
rosberg is still seeking his maiden victory in formula one .
" if you had offered me third position coming into this race , i would have taken it , " mercedes ' motorsport director norbert haug said on german television , also pointing out that the two mclarens ahead purchase their engines from mercedes .
" i would n't have really expected nico to be second overall after four races , it 's fantastic .
the championship is wide open , and we are certainly in the race . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel was unable to build on his pole position disappointment for vettel pole-sitter sebastian vettel was one of many drivers to lose out in the opening chaos .
to make matters worse , vettel lost out to his teammate mark webber into turn one , meaning that when both red bull cars simultaneously pitted at the first opportunity , not only did vettel put on tires that turned out to be the wrong choice for the conditions , he had to queue behind webber for the privilege of doing so , losing even more places .
" that really ca n't be helped , " vettel said after the race .
" he -lrb- webber -rrb- got the place off the start line .
i need to work out why my start was n't as good as his , but that 's just the plight of the second-placed car .
in that situation , you have to wait in the pits . "
vettel showed great speed during the race , and eventually clawed his way back up to sixth position .
12 months ago on a wet track in shanghai , he provided his red bull team with their first ever f1 win .
" we could have lost a lot more today , " he later reflected . vettel could have crashed at one stage as he battled into and out of the pit lane with eventual second place finisher lewis hamilton .
the racing incident was investigated ; both drivers received a reprimand but not a penalty .
past his prime ?
michael schumacher was the third german driver to finish in the points in shanghai , coming home in tenth place .
however , the multiple champion was almost a minute adrift of his teammate nico rosberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking grim for schumi 's return to f1 once dubbed the " regenmeister " -lrb- rain master -rrb- because of peerless performances in wet conditions in his heyday , the 41-year-old 's lackluster display - especially in the latter stages - have increased speculation that he may never recapture his best form .
" to be honest , this whole weekend was a disappointment to me , and disappointing from me , " schumacher lamented .
" i just have to write it off , try to learn for it , and concentrate on the next race in barcelona in three weeks time . "
schumacher 's mercedes team - like many others around the grid - were planning to use the three week break before the spanish grand prix to introduce a major package of performance upgrades for their car . but with european air travel still in chaos because of the volcanic eruption in iceland , the first item on the agenda for the teams right now is shipping their current cars back to europe in time for the next race .
some outfits say they have been looking into alternative freight options using boats or trains , in case they ca n't fly the equipment back as usual .

the memorial for the four germans killed last thursday in a rocket attack was held at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- headquarters in mazar-i-sharif .
some 1,500 soldiers from 19 different countries attended .
the bodies were supposed to be flown back to germany earlier in the weekend , but the volcanic ash cloud that has disrupted european air travel in recent days forced the transport to be delayed .

wieker said continued debate would play into the taliban 's strategy to weaken german resolve to stay in afghanistan .
the four dead all came from southern germany : a 33-year-old from ulm , a 28-year-old from weiden , and two 24 and 32-year old soldiers from ingolstadt .
five other soldiers were severely injured in the attack and evacuated to istanbul , where they are being treated in a us military hospital until they can be flown to germany .

superior strategic calls early on helped mercedes ' nico rosberg claim third place . jenson button has won his second race of the 2010 formula one season , coming from fifth on the grid in difficult , changeable weather conditions .
as in australia earlier this year , button 's victory was partly thanks to him keeping cool in the treacherous weather and being on the right kind of tires at the right time .
button - who many believed could struggle in his new mercedes-powered mclaren against the highly-fancied 2008 champion lewis hamilton - is now ten points clear of the pack in the overall driver 's standings , having led the field all season long last year .
" this win is something very special , and it really means a lot to me , " button said in the post-race press conference .
" all in all , i am very happy with the team 's progress too .
we made another big step in the right direction today . "
the mclaren-mercedes driver , faced with the nightmarish situation of drizzle beginning to fall moments before the race began , elected to struggle round on dry weather tires and wait to see if the rain set in .
meanwhile , the enormous majority of the field hit the panic button and dove straight into the pits for wet weather tires . bildunterschrift : it was reigning champion jenson button who managed to handle the difficult conditions best the rain soon abated .
button , nico rosberg and the renault drivers robert kubica and vitaly petrov sauntered off into the distance , as the rest of the field eventually had to pit again - losing more time - to go back to dry tires .
in this early phase of the race in shanghai , button hunted down and overtook the early leader nico rosberg - whose mercedes gp car was no match for the mclaren , especially in terms of straight-line speed .
once in front , he was never challenged .
mercedes engines dominate button 's teammate lewis hamilton also managed to climb the ranks and overtake rosberg during the course of the race , but the young german - whose result puts him second in the title behind button - felt had got the best result his car could deliver on the day .
" i 'm extremely happy , this is a super result for us , " rosberg said after the race .
" it was a crazy race in really difficult conditions .
the key to success was the opening phase , when the team and i decided to stay on dry tires .
i stayed out on track , just thinking : ' please , please do n't rain any more ! '
luckily the rain did n't get heavier , so i was able to keep up a good pace and lead the way in the early stages . "
rosberg is still seeking his maiden victory in formula one .
" if you had offered me third position coming into this race , i would have taken it , " mercedes ' motorsport director norbert haug said on german television , also pointing out that the two mclarens ahead purchase their engines from mercedes .
" i would n't have really expected nico to be second overall after four races , it 's fantastic .
the championship is wide open , and we are certainly in the race . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel was unable to build on his pole position disappointment for vettel pole-sitter sebastian vettel was one of many drivers to lose out in the opening chaos .
to make matters worse , vettel lost out to his teammate mark webber into turn one , meaning that when both red bull cars simultaneously pitted at the first opportunity , not only did vettel put on tires that turned out to be the wrong choice for the conditions , he had to queue behind webber for the privilege of doing so , losing even more places .
" that really ca n't be helped , " vettel said after the race .

i need to work out why my start was n't as good as his , but that 's just the plight of the second-placed car .

vettel showed great speed during the race , and eventually clawed his way back up to sixth position .
12 months ago on a wet track in shanghai , he provided his red bull team with their first ever f1 win .
" we could have lost a lot more today , " he later reflected . vettel could have crashed at one stage as he battled into and out of the pit lane with eventual second place finisher lewis hamilton .
the racing incident was investigated ; both drivers received a reprimand but not a penalty .

michael schumacher was the third german driver to finish in the points in shanghai , coming home in tenth place .
however , the multiple champion was almost a minute adrift of his teammate nico rosberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking grim for schumi 's return to f1 once dubbed the " regenmeister " -lrb- rain master -rrb- because of peerless performances in wet conditions in his heyday , the 41-year-old 's lackluster display - especially in the latter stages - have increased speculation that he may never recapture his best form .
" to be honest , this whole weekend was a disappointment to me , and disappointing from me , " schumacher lamented .
" i just have to write it off , try to learn for it , and concentrate on the next race in barcelona in three weeks time . "
schumacher 's mercedes team - like many others around the grid - were planning to use the three week break before the spanish grand prix to introduce a major package of performance upgrades for their car . but with european air travel still in chaos because of the volcanic eruption in iceland , the first item on the agenda for the teams right now is shipping their current cars back to europe in time for the next race .

the maltese men who claimed they were abused by priests while living in an orphanage had requested a private meeting with the pope .

church officials estimated up to 10,000 people attended despite heavy rain showers . during his addresss , benedict praised malta 's opposition to divorce and urged followers in the heavily catholic nation to uphold their faith .
" at every moment of our lives we depend entirely on god , " the pope told those gathered .

but malta 's top archbishop , paul cremona , was more critical . " we can not just cling to the model of the church to which we have been accustomed for decades , " cremona said as he opened the papal mass .
he did not directly mention the scandal but said the " church must be humble enough to recognize the failures and sins of its members . "
top german bishop supports pope but a top bishop in benedict 's native germany offered benedikt his " unreserved solidarity " as the pontiff marks the fifth anniversary of his election .
archbishop robert zollitsch , the head of the german bishops ' conference , wrote in a congratulatory letter that the pope could rely on the german church 's " full support . "
the pope is expected to hold a meeting with thousands of young catholics and take a harbor ride before returning to rome on sunday evening. smh / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

church officials estimated up to 10,000 people attended despite heavy rain showers . during his addresss , benedict praised malta 's opposition to divorce and urged followers in the heavily catholic nation to uphold their faith .
" at every moment of our lives we depend entirely on god , " the pope told those gathered .
no comment until the meeting with the abuse victims , the pontiff had not commented directly on the allegations that the church covered up for priests who molested minors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zollitsch has said that the german church stands behind the pope " these meetings are never announced beforehand , " the pope 's spokesman , federico lombardi , told reporters .
but malta 's top archbishop , paul cremona , was more critical . " we can not just cling to the model of the church to which we have been accustomed for decades , " cremona said as he opened the papal mass .
he did not directly mention the scandal but said the " church must be humble enough to recognize the failures and sins of its members . "
top german bishop supports pope but a top bishop in benedict 's native germany offered benedikt his " unreserved solidarity " as the pontiff marks the fifth anniversary of his election .
archbishop robert zollitsch , the head of the german bishops ' conference , wrote in a congratulatory letter that the pope could rely on the german church 's " full support . "
the pope is expected to hold a meeting with thousands of young catholics and take a harbor ride before returning to rome on sunday evening. smh / dpa / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 18.04.2010 jenson button leads mercedes-powered podium in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wet weather and safety car periods transformed the race f1 world champion jenson button has won the chinese grand prix in shanghai , ahead of his mclaren teammate lewis hamilton .
superior strategic calls early on helped mercedes ' nico rosberg claim third place . jenson button has won his second race of the 2010 formula one season , coming from fifth on the grid in difficult , changeable weather conditions .
as in australia earlier this year , button 's victory was partly thanks to him keeping cool in the treacherous weather and being on the right kind of tires at the right time .
button - who many believed could struggle in his new mercedes-powered mclaren against the highly-fancied 2008 champion lewis hamilton - is now ten points clear of the pack in the overall driver 's standings , having led the field all season long last year .
" this win is something very special , and it really means a lot to me , " button said in the post-race press conference .
" all in all , i am very happy with the team 's progress too .
we made another big step in the right direction today . "
the mclaren-mercedes driver , faced with the nightmarish situation of drizzle beginning to fall moments before the race began , elected to struggle round on dry weather tires and wait to see if the rain set in .
meanwhile , the enormous majority of the field hit the panic button and dove straight into the pits for wet weather tires . bildunterschrift : it was reigning champion jenson button who managed to handle the difficult conditions best the rain soon abated .
button , nico rosberg and the renault drivers robert kubica and vitaly petrov sauntered off into the distance , as the rest of the field eventually had to pit again - losing more time - to go back to dry tires .
in this early phase of the race in shanghai , button hunted down and overtook the early leader nico rosberg - whose mercedes gp car was no match for the mclaren , especially in terms of straight-line speed .
once in front , he was never challenged .
mercedes engines dominate button 's teammate lewis hamilton also managed to climb the ranks and overtake rosberg during the course of the race , but the young german - whose result puts him second in the title behind button - felt had got the best result his car could deliver on the day .
" i 'm extremely happy , this is a super result for us , " rosberg said after the race .
" it was a crazy race in really difficult conditions .
the key to success was the opening phase , when the team and i decided to stay on dry tires .
i stayed out on track , just thinking : ' please , please do n't rain any more ! '
luckily the rain did n't get heavier , so i was able to keep up a good pace and lead the way in the early stages . "
rosberg is still seeking his maiden victory in formula one .
" if you had offered me third position coming into this race , i would have taken it , " mercedes ' motorsport director norbert haug said on german television , also pointing out that the two mclarens ahead purchase their engines from mercedes .
" i would n't have really expected nico to be second overall after four races , it 's fantastic .
the championship is wide open , and we are certainly in the race . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel was unable to build on his pole position disappointment for vettel pole-sitter sebastian vettel was one of many drivers to lose out in the opening chaos .
to make matters worse , vettel lost out to his teammate mark webber into turn one , meaning that when both red bull cars simultaneously pitted at the first opportunity , not only did vettel put on tires that turned out to be the wrong choice for the conditions , he had to queue behind webber for the privilege of doing so , losing even more places .
" that really ca n't be helped , " vettel said after the race .
" he -lrb- webber -rrb- got the place off the start line .
i need to work out why my start was n't as good as his , but that 's just the plight of the second-placed car .
in that situation , you have to wait in the pits . "
vettel showed great speed during the race , and eventually clawed his way back up to sixth position .
12 months ago on a wet track in shanghai , he provided his red bull team with their first ever f1 win .
" we could have lost a lot more today , " he later reflected . vettel could have crashed at one stage as he battled into and out of the pit lane with eventual second place finisher lewis hamilton .
the racing incident was investigated ; both drivers received a reprimand but not a penalty .
past his prime ?
michael schumacher was the third german driver to finish in the points in shanghai , coming home in tenth place .
however , the multiple champion was almost a minute adrift of his teammate nico rosberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking grim for schumi 's return to f1 once dubbed the " regenmeister " -lrb- rain master -rrb- because of peerless performances in wet conditions in his heyday , the 41-year-old 's lackluster display - especially in the latter stages - have increased speculation that he may never recapture his best form .
" to be honest , this whole weekend was a disappointment to me , and disappointing from me , " schumacher lamented .
" i just have to write it off , try to learn for it , and concentrate on the next race in barcelona in three weeks time . "
schumacher 's mercedes team - like many others around the grid - were planning to use the three week break before the spanish grand prix to introduce a major package of performance upgrades for their car . but with european air travel still in chaos because of the volcanic eruption in iceland , the first item on the agenda for the teams right now is shipping their current cars back to europe in time for the next race .
some outfits say they have been looking into alternative freight options using boats or trains , in case they ca n't fly the equipment back as usual .

vettel showed great speed during the race , and eventually clawed his way back up to sixth position .
12 months ago on a wet track in shanghai , he provided his red bull team with their first ever f1 win .
" we could have lost a lot more today , " he later reflected . vettel could have crashed at one stage as he battled into and out of the pit lane with eventual second place finisher lewis hamilton .
the racing incident was investigated ; both drivers received a reprimand but not a penalty .
past his prime ?
michael schumacher was the third german driver to finish in the points in shanghai , coming home in tenth place .
however , the multiple champion was almost a minute adrift of his teammate nico rosberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking grim for schumi 's return to f1 once dubbed the " regenmeister " -lrb- rain master -rrb- because of peerless performances in wet conditions in his heyday , the 41-year-old 's lackluster display - especially in the latter stages - have increased speculation that he may never recapture his best form .
" to be honest , this whole weekend was a disappointment to me , and disappointing from me , " schumacher lamented .
" i just have to write it off , try to learn for it , and concentrate on the next race in barcelona in three weeks time . "
schumacher 's mercedes team - like many others around the grid - were planning to use the three week break before the spanish grand prix to introduce a major package of performance upgrades for their car . but with european air travel still in chaos because of the volcanic eruption in iceland , the first item on the agenda for the teams right now is shipping their current cars back to europe in time for the next race .
some outfits say they have been looking into alternative freight options using boats or trains , in case they ca n't fly the equipment back as usual .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 18.04.2010 early neo rauch patrons discuss ' magic and mystery ' of his art großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's ' masterly ' painting appeals to art lovers , mera rubell says don and mera rubell began collecting art as newlyweds in new york city in 1964 .
they have collected steadily ever since , traveling the globe to acquire contemporary art works that appeal to their personal aesthetic . the rubell family collection now operates as a private museum and educational institution in miami , florida .
the collection today comprises more than 5,000 works .
it is housed in a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 45,000-square-foot -rrb- public space with a vast library , rotating exhibitions from the collection , and traveling exhibits that tour major museums throughout the us and abroad . the rubells were among the earliest proponents of neo rauch 's work .
they were " amazed ” by his paintings when they first saw his work at the liste young art fair in basel , switzerland , about a decade ago and bought their first work by rauch - ' das neue ' - in 2000 .
they later collected a number of paintings by rauch and other members of what would eventually be dubbed the leipzig school .
the rubells ' art foundation sponsored an exhibit of these combined works entitled “ life after death , ” which traveled to six us museums between 2004 and 2008 . deutsche welle spoke to the rubells just hours before they were due to fly to germany to celebrate the back-to-back openings of rauch exhibitions in leipzig -lrb- april 18 -rrb- and munich -lrb- april 20 -rrb- in honor of the artist 's 50th birthday . deutsche welle : don and mera rubell , can you tell me a little bit about your collection ?
who decides what you buy ? mera rubell : we 've been collecting art since we got married , 46 years ago .
we started with a working couple 's budget - i was a teacher and don was in medical school .
its been a relentless pursuit of contemporary art starting from the moment we got together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : don and mera rubell have been passionate collectors for 46 years don rubell : to answer your question , we do it ourselves .
now our son and daughter are very involved , so it 's the four of us who make all decisions as far as what we collect . mera : you can call it a family affair . let 's talk about neo rauch , who is turning 50 on april 18 .
why did you start collecting his works ? don : that 's an easy one .
he 's a great artist . so you saw his works and instantly knew … this is it ?
this is the one to buy ? don : with neo rauch it was sort of an odd thing because we saw his work early , early , early - like in ' 94 or ' 96 .
we liked it very much and thought about it , and followed it .
and the work became stronger and stronger .
and i guess it was around 2000 that we bought our first piece . mera : we were traveling to berlin after the wall came down , and someone said , ' you gotta check out what is going on in leipzig . '
so we went , and there is just a huge , old tradition of painting in that academy . what did rauch 's work mean to you when you saw it ? mera : somehow neo rauch was able to deliver a kind of history painting of a moment that passed , that had the psychological power of a time gone , and make it relevant today . don : it 's a combination of fantasy , surrealism and history .
but whether the exact history exists , or whether the imagination constructs the history , does n't matter .
the tone of the paintings is more historical than the fact of the paintings . mera : exactly !
it 's not like he 's telling you a specific story .
his paintings take you into some sort of psychological space , and what makes them powerful is that the psychological space almost bridges the place of history and present - and the future , really . he 's quite a master .
he has this ability with color , with figure , with drama .
these paintings are kind of stage paintings , a kind of storytelling .
and you can take that story into your own personal imagination . bildunterschrift : rauch 's works are ' a kind of storytelling that you can take into your imagination , ' mera rubell says rauch has been called the first german painter to bridge east and west germany … don : the impression of east germany is achieved more through his palette than his choice of subject matter .
so that the colors are reminiscent of some historical past , whereas his subject matter is almost timeless . the leipzig school painters became successful in the us , before they really got off the ground in germany . why is that ? don : i think that collectors of his work were not necessarily american but were very international .
and in a certain sense , this is how it goes .
it 's always difficult to deal with things close to home .
you find most of the great american pop art collections are in germany , for example . mera : i think it 's always dangerous to hold it against an artist for becoming quickly accepted .
i think europeans are much more comfortable with a long , slow-developing situation and career .
perhaps our enthusiasm put some people off . -lsb- with the traveling exhibit ' life after death ' -rsb- there was so much excitement around seeing the work in america , because it was a window into these very , very skillful painters , with of course neo being the master .
and no matter how much we want to walk away from trained classical painters , we ca n't .
it 's a love affair that will never , ever end . i have read that some of the leipzig school painters are unhappy with the moniker they were given .
they reject the idea that they are part of any school .
is that so ? don : you know , when pop art first became popular , all of the artists loved the moniker , because collectors would say , ' i 'd like to have pop art . '
as each of the artists became well known in their own right , they wanted the individuality of not being part of a group .
and in a sense you are dealing with the same thing here .
ultimately , each artist wants his or her own individuality . you 've said that when you first saw rauch 's work , around 1996 , he jumped out at you as ' someone to watch . '
what was his status at that time ?
was he already established , or young and struggling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's works combine a historical look with psychological pull don : the italians have a wonderful expression , ne carne ne pesce - neither fish nor fowl .
he was n't an international art star - no gallery in new york was even looking at him at that time .
but he clearly was way beyond the student stage . what would you say to someone who went to a neo rauch exhibition and found the work to be inscrutable and even frustrating , because they could n't figure out what the paintings were supposed to be about ? don : that 's a very good working definition of good contemporary art .
because what you always want to look for in all of the best young art is art that makes you slightly uncomfortable , and that deals with something you do n't understand .
and that gradually over a period of time , it becomes incorporated into your own essence . this is what happens with neo rauch .
i do n't know to this day what exactly they are about .
i just know they are powerful paintings .
the reason you do n't understand the painting is because no one has been able to determine the narrative of the painting .
so , drop the narrative - the narrative is not given to you . mera : but that 's how art is !
look , there is so much information in the world that gives you the answer .
most communication in the world today has the answer because people usually want you to buy something .
or do something .
or vote for somebody .
the answer is given to you .
most great art - the really good artists - are basically letting you in to their personal , mental space .
it 's not giving you any answers .
i think the artist is as disturbed by what he 's painting as you might be .
and you are !

they have collected steadily ever since , traveling the globe to acquire contemporary art works that appeal to their personal aesthetic . the rubell family collection now operates as a private museum and educational institution in miami , florida .
the collection today comprises more than 5,000 works .
it is housed in a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 45,000-square-foot -rrb- public space with a vast library , rotating exhibitions from the collection , and traveling exhibits that tour major museums throughout the us and abroad . the rubells were among the earliest proponents of neo rauch 's work .
they were " amazed ” by his paintings when they first saw his work at the liste young art fair in basel , switzerland , about a decade ago and bought their first work by rauch - ' das neue ' - in 2000 .
they later collected a number of paintings by rauch and other members of what would eventually be dubbed the leipzig school .
the rubells ' art foundation sponsored an exhibit of these combined works entitled “ life after death , ” which traveled to six us museums between 2004 and 2008 . deutsche welle spoke to the rubells just hours before they were due to fly to germany to celebrate the back-to-back openings of rauch exhibitions in leipzig -lrb- april 18 -rrb- and munich -lrb- april 20 -rrb- in honor of the artist 's 50th birthday . deutsche welle : don and mera rubell , can you tell me a little bit about your collection ?
who decides what you buy ? mera rubell : we 've been collecting art since we got married , 46 years ago .
we started with a working couple 's budget - i was a teacher and don was in medical school .
its been a relentless pursuit of contemporary art starting from the moment we got together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : don and mera rubell have been passionate collectors for 46 years don rubell : to answer your question , we do it ourselves .
now our son and daughter are very involved , so it 's the four of us who make all decisions as far as what we collect . mera : you can call it a family affair . let 's talk about neo rauch , who is turning 50 on april 18 .
why did you start collecting his works ? don : that 's an easy one .
he 's a great artist . so you saw his works and instantly knew … this is it ?
this is the one to buy ? don : with neo rauch it was sort of an odd thing because we saw his work early , early , early - like in ' 94 or ' 96 .
we liked it very much and thought about it , and followed it .
and the work became stronger and stronger .
and i guess it was around 2000 that we bought our first piece . mera : we were traveling to berlin after the wall came down , and someone said , ' you gotta check out what is going on in leipzig . '
so we went , and there is just a huge , old tradition of painting in that academy . what did rauch 's work mean to you when you saw it ? mera : somehow neo rauch was able to deliver a kind of history painting of a moment that passed , that had the psychological power of a time gone , and make it relevant today . don : it 's a combination of fantasy , surrealism and history .
but whether the exact history exists , or whether the imagination constructs the history , does n't matter .
the tone of the paintings is more historical than the fact of the paintings . mera : exactly !
it 's not like he 's telling you a specific story .
his paintings take you into some sort of psychological space , and what makes them powerful is that the psychological space almost bridges the place of history and present - and the future , really . he 's quite a master .
he has this ability with color , with figure , with drama .
these paintings are kind of stage paintings , a kind of storytelling .
and you can take that story into your own personal imagination . bildunterschrift : rauch 's works are ' a kind of storytelling that you can take into your imagination , ' mera rubell says rauch has been called the first german painter to bridge east and west germany … don : the impression of east germany is achieved more through his palette than his choice of subject matter .
so that the colors are reminiscent of some historical past , whereas his subject matter is almost timeless . the leipzig school painters became successful in the us , before they really got off the ground in germany . why is that ? don : i think that collectors of his work were not necessarily american but were very international .
and in a certain sense , this is how it goes .
it 's always difficult to deal with things close to home .
you find most of the great american pop art collections are in germany , for example . mera : i think it 's always dangerous to hold it against an artist for becoming quickly accepted .
i think europeans are much more comfortable with a long , slow-developing situation and career .
perhaps our enthusiasm put some people off . -lsb- with the traveling exhibit ' life after death ' -rsb- there was so much excitement around seeing the work in america , because it was a window into these very , very skillful painters , with of course neo being the master .
and no matter how much we want to walk away from trained classical painters , we ca n't .
it 's a love affair that will never , ever end . i have read that some of the leipzig school painters are unhappy with the moniker they were given .
they reject the idea that they are part of any school .
is that so ? don : you know , when pop art first became popular , all of the artists loved the moniker , because collectors would say , ' i 'd like to have pop art . '
as each of the artists became well known in their own right , they wanted the individuality of not being part of a group .
and in a sense you are dealing with the same thing here .
ultimately , each artist wants his or her own individuality . you 've said that when you first saw rauch 's work , around 1996 , he jumped out at you as ' someone to watch . '
what was his status at that time ?

i think europeans are much more comfortable with a long , slow-developing situation and career .
perhaps our enthusiasm put some people off . -lsb- with the traveling exhibit ' life after death ' -rsb- there was so much excitement around seeing the work in america , because it was a window into these very , very skillful painters , with of course neo being the master .

it 's a love affair that will never , ever end . i have read that some of the leipzig school painters are unhappy with the moniker they were given .
they reject the idea that they are part of any school .
is that so ? don : you know , when pop art first became popular , all of the artists loved the moniker , because collectors would say , ' i 'd like to have pop art . '
as each of the artists became well known in their own right , they wanted the individuality of not being part of a group .
and in a sense you are dealing with the same thing here .
ultimately , each artist wants his or her own individuality . you 've said that when you first saw rauch 's work , around 1996 , he jumped out at you as ' someone to watch . '
what was his status at that time ?
was he already established , or young and struggling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's works combine a historical look with psychological pull don : the italians have a wonderful expression , ne carne ne pesce - neither fish nor fowl .

but he clearly was way beyond the student stage . what would you say to someone who went to a neo rauch exhibition and found the work to be inscrutable and even frustrating , because they could n't figure out what the paintings were supposed to be about ? don : that 's a very good working definition of good contemporary art .
because what you always want to look for in all of the best young art is art that makes you slightly uncomfortable , and that deals with something you do n't understand .
and that gradually over a period of time , it becomes incorporated into your own essence . this is what happens with neo rauch .
i do n't know to this day what exactly they are about .
i just know they are powerful paintings .
the reason you do n't understand the painting is because no one has been able to determine the narrative of the painting .
so , drop the narrative - the narrative is not given to you . mera : but that 's how art is !
look , there is so much information in the world that gives you the answer .
most communication in the world today has the answer because people usually want you to buy something .
or do something .
or vote for somebody .
the answer is given to you .
most great art - the really good artists - are basically letting you in to their personal , mental space .
it 's not giving you any answers .
i think the artist is as disturbed by what he 's painting as you might be .

they have collected steadily ever since , traveling the globe to acquire contemporary art works that appeal to their personal aesthetic . the rubell family collection now operates as a private museum and educational institution in miami , florida .
the collection today comprises more than 5,000 works .
it is housed in a 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 45,000-square-foot -rrb- public space with a vast library , rotating exhibitions from the collection , and traveling exhibits that tour major museums throughout the us and abroad . the rubells were among the earliest proponents of neo rauch 's work .
they were " amazed ” by his paintings when they first saw his work at the liste young art fair in basel , switzerland , about a decade ago and bought their first work by rauch - ' das neue ' - in 2000 .
they later collected a number of paintings by rauch and other members of what would eventually be dubbed the leipzig school .
the rubells ' art foundation sponsored an exhibit of these combined works entitled “ life after death , ” which traveled to six us museums between 2004 and 2008 . deutsche welle spoke to the rubells just hours before they were due to fly to germany to celebrate the back-to-back openings of rauch exhibitions in leipzig -lrb- april 18 -rrb- and munich -lrb- april 20 -rrb- in honor of the artist 's 50th birthday . deutsche welle : don and mera rubell , can you tell me a little bit about your collection ?
who decides what you buy ? mera rubell : we 've been collecting art since we got married , 46 years ago .
we started with a working couple 's budget - i was a teacher and don was in medical school .
its been a relentless pursuit of contemporary art starting from the moment we got together . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : don and mera rubell have been passionate collectors for 46 years don rubell : to answer your question , we do it ourselves .
now our son and daughter are very involved , so it 's the four of us who make all decisions as far as what we collect . mera : you can call it a family affair . let 's talk about neo rauch , who is turning 50 on april 18 .
why did you start collecting his works ? don : that 's an easy one .
he 's a great artist . so you saw his works and instantly knew … this is it ?
this is the one to buy ? don : with neo rauch it was sort of an odd thing because we saw his work early , early , early - like in ' 94 or ' 96 .
we liked it very much and thought about it , and followed it .
and the work became stronger and stronger .
and i guess it was around 2000 that we bought our first piece . mera : we were traveling to berlin after the wall came down , and someone said , ' you gotta check out what is going on in leipzig . '
so we went , and there is just a huge , old tradition of painting in that academy . what did rauch 's work mean to you when you saw it ? mera : somehow neo rauch was able to deliver a kind of history painting of a moment that passed , that had the psychological power of a time gone , and make it relevant today . don : it 's a combination of fantasy , surrealism and history .
but whether the exact history exists , or whether the imagination constructs the history , does n't matter .
the tone of the paintings is more historical than the fact of the paintings . mera : exactly !
it 's not like he 's telling you a specific story .
his paintings take you into some sort of psychological space , and what makes them powerful is that the psychological space almost bridges the place of history and present - and the future , really . he 's quite a master .
he has this ability with color , with figure , with drama .
these paintings are kind of stage paintings , a kind of storytelling .
and you can take that story into your own personal imagination . bildunterschrift : rauch 's works are ' a kind of storytelling that you can take into your imagination , ' mera rubell says rauch has been called the first german painter to bridge east and west germany … don : the impression of east germany is achieved more through his palette than his choice of subject matter .
so that the colors are reminiscent of some historical past , whereas his subject matter is almost timeless . the leipzig school painters became successful in the us , before they really got off the ground in germany . why is that ? don : i think that collectors of his work were not necessarily american but were very international .
and in a certain sense , this is how it goes .
it 's always difficult to deal with things close to home .
you find most of the great american pop art collections are in germany , for example . mera : i think it 's always dangerous to hold it against an artist for becoming quickly accepted .

but whether the exact history exists , or whether the imagination constructs the history , does n't matter .
the tone of the paintings is more historical than the fact of the paintings . mera : exactly !
it 's not like he 's telling you a specific story .
his paintings take you into some sort of psychological space , and what makes them powerful is that the psychological space almost bridges the place of history and present - and the future , really . he 's quite a master .
he has this ability with color , with figure , with drama .
these paintings are kind of stage paintings , a kind of storytelling .
and you can take that story into your own personal imagination . bildunterschrift : rauch 's works are ' a kind of storytelling that you can take into your imagination , ' mera rubell says rauch has been called the first german painter to bridge east and west germany … don : the impression of east germany is achieved more through his palette than his choice of subject matter .
so that the colors are reminiscent of some historical past , whereas his subject matter is almost timeless . the leipzig school painters became successful in the us , before they really got off the ground in germany . why is that ? don : i think that collectors of his work were not necessarily american but were very international .
and in a certain sense , this is how it goes .
it 's always difficult to deal with things close to home .
you find most of the great american pop art collections are in germany , for example . mera : i think it 's always dangerous to hold it against an artist for becoming quickly accepted .
i think europeans are much more comfortable with a long , slow-developing situation and career .
perhaps our enthusiasm put some people off . -lsb- with the traveling exhibit ' life after death ' -rsb- there was so much excitement around seeing the work in america , because it was a window into these very , very skillful painters , with of course neo being the master .
and no matter how much we want to walk away from trained classical painters , we ca n't .
it 's a love affair that will never , ever end . i have read that some of the leipzig school painters are unhappy with the moniker they were given .
they reject the idea that they are part of any school .
is that so ? don : you know , when pop art first became popular , all of the artists loved the moniker , because collectors would say , ' i 'd like to have pop art . '
as each of the artists became well known in their own right , they wanted the individuality of not being part of a group .
and in a sense you are dealing with the same thing here .
ultimately , each artist wants his or her own individuality . you 've said that when you first saw rauch 's work , around 1996 , he jumped out at you as ' someone to watch . '
what was his status at that time ?
was he already established , or young and struggling ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rauch 's works combine a historical look with psychological pull don : the italians have a wonderful expression , ne carne ne pesce - neither fish nor fowl .
he was n't an international art star - no gallery in new york was even looking at him at that time .
but he clearly was way beyond the student stage . what would you say to someone who went to a neo rauch exhibition and found the work to be inscrutable and even frustrating , because they could n't figure out what the paintings were supposed to be about ? don : that 's a very good working definition of good contemporary art .
because what you always want to look for in all of the best young art is art that makes you slightly uncomfortable , and that deals with something you do n't understand .
and that gradually over a period of time , it becomes incorporated into your own essence . this is what happens with neo rauch .
i do n't know to this day what exactly they are about .
i just know they are powerful paintings .
the reason you do n't understand the painting is because no one has been able to determine the narrative of the painting .
so , drop the narrative - the narrative is not given to you . mera : but that 's how art is !
look , there is so much information in the world that gives you the answer .
most communication in the world today has the answer because people usually want you to buy something .
or do something .
or vote for somebody .
the answer is given to you .
most great art - the really good artists - are basically letting you in to their personal , mental space .
it 's not giving you any answers .
i think the artist is as disturbed by what he 's painting as you might be .
and you are !
i am too . it 's the magic and the mystery of painting .
it goes off into the far reaches of our imaginations and has no answers .
but it certainly engages us emotionally . interview : jennifer abramsohn editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the memorial for the four germans killed last thursday in a rocket attack was held at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- headquarters in mazar-i-sharif .
some 1,500 soldiers from 19 different countries attended .
the bodies were supposed to be flown back to germany earlier in the weekend , but the volcanic ash cloud that has disrupted european air travel in recent days forced the transport to be delayed .
a funeral in southern germany is planned for friday , but the exact date and time are unclear . germany 's national inspector of the armed forces , volker wieker , told the crowd that public debate about german troops ' participation in the afghan mission " should and will not be allowed to stand in the way of our security and the will of the afghan people . "
wieker said continued debate would play into the taliban 's strategy to weaken german resolve to stay in afghanistan .
the four dead all came from southern germany : a 33-year-old from ulm , a 28-year-old from weiden , and two 24 and 32-year old soldiers from ingolstadt .
five other soldiers were severely injured in the attack and evacuated to istanbul , where they are being treated in a us military hospital until they can be flown to germany .
the condition of two soldiers is still so serious that they could n't yet be transported , but a defense ministry spokesman said their condition was stable .

the memorial for the four germans killed last thursday in a rocket attack was held at the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- headquarters in mazar-i-sharif .
some 1,500 soldiers from 19 different countries attended .
the bodies were supposed to be flown back to germany earlier in the weekend , but the volcanic ash cloud that has disrupted european air travel in recent days forced the transport to be delayed .
a funeral in southern germany is planned for friday , but the exact date and time are unclear . germany 's national inspector of the armed forces , volker wieker , told the crowd that public debate about german troops ' participation in the afghan mission " should and will not be allowed to stand in the way of our security and the will of the afghan people . "
wieker said continued debate would play into the taliban 's strategy to weaken german resolve to stay in afghanistan .
the four dead all came from southern germany : a 33-year-old from ulm , a 28-year-old from weiden , and two 24 and 32-year old soldiers from ingolstadt .
five other soldiers were severely injured in the attack and evacuated to istanbul , where they are being treated in a us military hospital until they can be flown to germany .
the condition of two soldiers is still so serious that they could n't yet be transported , but a defense ministry spokesman said their condition was stable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 18.04.2010 jenson button leads mercedes-powered podium in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wet weather and safety car periods transformed the race f1 world champion jenson button has won the chinese grand prix in shanghai , ahead of his mclaren teammate lewis hamilton .
superior strategic calls early on helped mercedes ' nico rosberg claim third place . jenson button has won his second race of the 2010 formula one season , coming from fifth on the grid in difficult , changeable weather conditions .
as in australia earlier this year , button 's victory was partly thanks to him keeping cool in the treacherous weather and being on the right kind of tires at the right time .
button - who many believed could struggle in his new mercedes-powered mclaren against the highly-fancied 2008 champion lewis hamilton - is now ten points clear of the pack in the overall driver 's standings , having led the field all season long last year .
" this win is something very special , and it really means a lot to me , " button said in the post-race press conference .
" all in all , i am very happy with the team 's progress too .
we made another big step in the right direction today . "
the mclaren-mercedes driver , faced with the nightmarish situation of drizzle beginning to fall moments before the race began , elected to struggle round on dry weather tires and wait to see if the rain set in .
meanwhile , the enormous majority of the field hit the panic button and dove straight into the pits for wet weather tires . bildunterschrift : it was reigning champion jenson button who managed to handle the difficult conditions best the rain soon abated .
button , nico rosberg and the renault drivers robert kubica and vitaly petrov sauntered off into the distance , as the rest of the field eventually had to pit again - losing more time - to go back to dry tires .
in this early phase of the race in shanghai , button hunted down and overtook the early leader nico rosberg - whose mercedes gp car was no match for the mclaren , especially in terms of straight-line speed .
once in front , he was never challenged .
mercedes engines dominate button 's teammate lewis hamilton also managed to climb the ranks and overtake rosberg during the course of the race , but the young german - whose result puts him second in the title behind button - felt had got the best result his car could deliver on the day .
" i 'm extremely happy , this is a super result for us , " rosberg said after the race .
" it was a crazy race in really difficult conditions .
the key to success was the opening phase , when the team and i decided to stay on dry tires .
i stayed out on track , just thinking : ' please , please do n't rain any more ! '
luckily the rain did n't get heavier , so i was able to keep up a good pace and lead the way in the early stages . "
rosberg is still seeking his maiden victory in formula one .
" if you had offered me third position coming into this race , i would have taken it , " mercedes ' motorsport director norbert haug said on german television , also pointing out that the two mclarens ahead purchase their engines from mercedes .
" i would n't have really expected nico to be second overall after four races , it 's fantastic .
the championship is wide open , and we are certainly in the race . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel was unable to build on his pole position disappointment for vettel pole-sitter sebastian vettel was one of many drivers to lose out in the opening chaos .
to make matters worse , vettel lost out to his teammate mark webber into turn one , meaning that when both red bull cars simultaneously pitted at the first opportunity , not only did vettel put on tires that turned out to be the wrong choice for the conditions , he had to queue behind webber for the privilege of doing so , losing even more places .
" that really ca n't be helped , " vettel said after the race .
" he -lrb- webber -rrb- got the place off the start line .
i need to work out why my start was n't as good as his , but that 's just the plight of the second-placed car .
in that situation , you have to wait in the pits . "
vettel showed great speed during the race , and eventually clawed his way back up to sixth position .
12 months ago on a wet track in shanghai , he provided his red bull team with their first ever f1 win .
" we could have lost a lot more today , " he later reflected . vettel could have crashed at one stage as he battled into and out of the pit lane with eventual second place finisher lewis hamilton .
the racing incident was investigated ; both drivers received a reprimand but not a penalty .
past his prime ?
michael schumacher was the third german driver to finish in the points in shanghai , coming home in tenth place .
however , the multiple champion was almost a minute adrift of his teammate nico rosberg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things are looking grim for schumi 's return to f1 once dubbed the " regenmeister " -lrb- rain master -rrb- because of peerless performances in wet conditions in his heyday , the 41-year-old 's lackluster display - especially in the latter stages - have increased speculation that he may never recapture his best form .
" to be honest , this whole weekend was a disappointment to me , and disappointing from me , " schumacher lamented .
" i just have to write it off , try to learn for it , and concentrate on the next race in barcelona in three weeks time . "
schumacher 's mercedes team - like many others around the grid - were planning to use the three week break before the spanish grand prix to introduce a major package of performance upgrades for their car . but with european air travel still in chaos because of the volcanic eruption in iceland , the first item on the agenda for the teams right now is shipping their current cars back to europe in time for the next race .
some outfits say they have been looking into alternative freight options using boats or trains , in case they ca n't fly the equipment back as usual .

" " taking into account the declared positions of mr eroglu against a federation , and for the establishment of two independent states in cyprus , this could cause very serious problems for the -lrb- peace -rrb- negotiations , " stefanou told reporters in nicosia . eroglu , leader of the national unity party -lrb- ubp -rrb- , has said he favors a two-state confederation .
however , he has also said he would not abandon the reunification talks . " talks will continue because i want peace more than those who say that i do n't , " eroglu told supporters after declaring victory .
" i seek a solution based on the realities of the island and a solution that all of us can live with . " around 164,000 people out of the 250,000 population of the island were eligible to vote .
turnout was reported to be about 75 percent . bildunterschrift : turkey is the only country to recognize the turkish cypriot government reunification ' a steep and uphill push ' analysts have said the election results would likely delay reunification efforts , and that leaders may have to lower their expectations if they want to find a solution that can be agreed on by both sides . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus has been divided since 1974 " nobody is going to walk away from the table , but this makes reunification a steep and uphill push , " said hugh pope , turkey-cyprus director for the international crisis group .
" everybody will have to think again and find a way forward . " cypriot voters on both the greek and turkish sides would have to approve any deal between their leaders in a referendum . peace talks on hold with 95 percent of sunday 's vote counted , eroglu won slightly more than the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff against incumbent president mehmet ali talat .
talat received 42.8 percent of the vote . talat , leader of the left-leaning republican turkish party -lrb- ctp -rrb- , supports reunification of the island , which has been divided into the greek south and turkish north since 1974 . turkey is the only country that recognizes the government of the self-declared turkish cypriot state , which it has occupied since 1974 .
ankara still keeps some 35,000 troops on the mediterranean island . the greek cypriot government represents the island in the european union , and says it will continue to block turkey 's attempt to join the eu as long as the island remains divided . the united nations-led peace talks on the mediterranean island were on hold during the election campaign . cb / acb / svs / afp / ap / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
