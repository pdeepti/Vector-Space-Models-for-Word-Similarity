his ensemble is orchestra-in-residence at this year 's beethovenfest bonn . conductor paavo jarvi has received numerous awards , including a grammy and an echo classic conductor of the year distinction in 2010 .
born in estonia , he moved to the united states , where he studied with leonard bernstein . he is currently music director of both the cincinnati symphony orchestra and the frankfurt radio symphony orchestra .
since 2004 , he 's been artistic director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie -lrb- german chamber philharmonic -rrb- of bremen , the beethovenfest 's orchestra-in-residence .
deutsche welle spoke with jarvi about the aims of the festival and the feeling behind the music performed there . deutsche welle : there is an ongoing relationship between the deutsche kammerphilharmonie and the beethovenfest , with the kammerphilharmonie being the orchestra-in-residence .
has this collaboration influenced the culture and development of this body of musicians ? paavo jarvi : an orchestra that functions on a self-governing basis as we do needs good friends and good partners .
and certainly the beethovenfest in bonn has been a fantastic partner .
it does help to have a festival that is well run , has a good infrastructure , and has - most importantly - a real guiding light .
i mean by that -lsb- beethovenfest director -rsb- ilona schmiel , who is an enormous source of energy .
her imagination and her interest in doing something new are really fantastic . we know that beethoven did n't have fond memories of bonn .
but is there something here , in the public and the atmosphere or in the expectations of the people , that strikes you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn is home to the annual beethovenfest the festival has established itself as a place that really makes beethoven its center .
and let 's face it : we 're performing in a relatively modern hall , and the city is obviously different from when beethoven was walking around here .
but that is not so important .
what is important is that the idea lives , the idea is strong , and -lsb- bonn -rsb- is the right place to create a festival around beethoven , because it is his birthplace .
and to me , the real souls of the festival are the ones who create it .
what beethoven thought about the city when he was here is almost irrelevant . this year 's beethovenfest also focuses on works by composer robert schumann .
what is there to discover about such a frequently performed composer ? it 's the type of gestures that schumann makes in his music - emotional , dramatic gestures that communicate to you with such directness and sincerity .
and there 's that impulsive , neurotic energy , the extremes of expression , the moments that can go to unbelievable euphoria and , a second later , -lsb- to -rsb- the deepest , darkest melancholy . to wear your heart on your sleeve in public , and go from one extreme to another and not be ashamed of it , is something that we have always been taught to be wrong .
we 're uncomfortable with that .
what we are trying to do with the kammerphilharmonie is to bring out just this aspect .
music by schumann needs to be exaggerated on every level .
exaggerated , not put into an acceptable , comfortable norm . against the backdrop of thousands of recordings , and many , many others who have preceded you , do you feel the need to shake up the routine ? one of the most difficult things i find , in general , is changing old habits .
people who have grown up with brahms and schumann and beethoven have heard , so many times , those pieces in a certain way .
they are simply so engrained that even if -lsb- these people -rsb- sometimes intellectually try to change something , when it comes to performance , they often fall back to those gestures that they heard when they were young .
you simply need to have enough time and repetition to create a new tradition and make it your own . that is something that is doable , especially if we do these beethoven and schumann " total immersion courses " - all symphonies in three days , or all schumann symphonies and overtures in two days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playing a cycle , like all beethoven symphonies , brings you amazingly close to the composer , says jarvi it 's amazing how close you can get to a composer if you really make an incredibly concentrated program of it and follow some principles and see how they work in other symphonies , overtures and so on .
it gradually becomes a language that you identify with , not just intellectually ; it becomes part of your genetics . would you prefer to shake up the routine or to strive for an authoritative interpretation ? l do n't want to change things per se or to create something that has n't been done .
quite the opposite .
i want to do something that makes sense to me .
the only reason i rethink certain things is because they never made sense to me to begin with . maybe one of the reasons our beethoven is successful is that we do keep a lot of tradition in it .
it has to be organic and it has to have an inner logic . interview : rick fulker editor : elaine yeung / louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his ensemble is orchestra-in-residence at this year 's beethovenfest bonn . conductor paavo jarvi has received numerous awards , including a grammy and an echo classic conductor of the year distinction in 2010 .
born in estonia , he moved to the united states , where he studied with leonard bernstein . he is currently music director of both the cincinnati symphony orchestra and the frankfurt radio symphony orchestra .
since 2004 , he 's been artistic director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie -lrb- german chamber philharmonic -rrb- of bremen , the beethovenfest 's orchestra-in-residence .
deutsche welle spoke with jarvi about the aims of the festival and the feeling behind the music performed there . deutsche welle : there is an ongoing relationship between the deutsche kammerphilharmonie and the beethovenfest , with the kammerphilharmonie being the orchestra-in-residence .
has this collaboration influenced the culture and development of this body of musicians ? paavo jarvi : an orchestra that functions on a self-governing basis as we do needs good friends and good partners .
and certainly the beethovenfest in bonn has been a fantastic partner .
it does help to have a festival that is well run , has a good infrastructure , and has - most importantly - a real guiding light .
i mean by that -lsb- beethovenfest director -rsb- ilona schmiel , who is an enormous source of energy .
her imagination and her interest in doing something new are really fantastic . we know that beethoven did n't have fond memories of bonn .
but is there something here , in the public and the atmosphere or in the expectations of the people , that strikes you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn is home to the annual beethovenfest the festival has established itself as a place that really makes beethoven its center .
and let 's face it : we 're performing in a relatively modern hall , and the city is obviously different from when beethoven was walking around here .
but that is not so important .
what is important is that the idea lives , the idea is strong , and -lsb- bonn -rsb- is the right place to create a festival around beethoven , because it is his birthplace .
and to me , the real souls of the festival are the ones who create it .
what beethoven thought about the city when he was here is almost irrelevant . this year 's beethovenfest also focuses on works by composer robert schumann .
what is there to discover about such a frequently performed composer ? it 's the type of gestures that schumann makes in his music - emotional , dramatic gestures that communicate to you with such directness and sincerity .
and there 's that impulsive , neurotic energy , the extremes of expression , the moments that can go to unbelievable euphoria and , a second later , -lsb- to -rsb- the deepest , darkest melancholy . to wear your heart on your sleeve in public , and go from one extreme to another and not be ashamed of it , is something that we have always been taught to be wrong .
we 're uncomfortable with that .
what we are trying to do with the kammerphilharmonie is to bring out just this aspect .
music by schumann needs to be exaggerated on every level .
exaggerated , not put into an acceptable , comfortable norm . against the backdrop of thousands of recordings , and many , many others who have preceded you , do you feel the need to shake up the routine ? one of the most difficult things i find , in general , is changing old habits .
people who have grown up with brahms and schumann and beethoven have heard , so many times , those pieces in a certain way .
they are simply so engrained that even if -lsb- these people -rsb- sometimes intellectually try to change something , when it comes to performance , they often fall back to those gestures that they heard when they were young .
you simply need to have enough time and repetition to create a new tradition and make it your own . that is something that is doable , especially if we do these beethoven and schumann " total immersion courses " - all symphonies in three days , or all schumann symphonies and overtures in two days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playing a cycle , like all beethoven symphonies , brings you amazingly close to the composer , says jarvi it 's amazing how close you can get to a composer if you really make an incredibly concentrated program of it and follow some principles and see how they work in other symphonies , overtures and so on .
it gradually becomes a language that you identify with , not just intellectually ; it becomes part of your genetics . would you prefer to shake up the routine or to strive for an authoritative interpretation ? l do n't want to change things per se or to create something that has n't been done .
quite the opposite .
i want to do something that makes sense to me .
the only reason i rethink certain things is because they never made sense to me to begin with . maybe one of the reasons our beethoven is successful is that we do keep a lot of tradition in it .
it has to be organic and it has to have an inner logic . interview : rick fulker editor : elaine yeung / louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de winter sports -pipe- 09.10.2010 munich 's 2018 olympic bid hinges on alpine town of garmisch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this meadow is a proposed site for the athletes ' village if munich wins the bid to host the 2018 winter olympics , about half of the events will take place in the alpine town of garmisch-partenkirchen .
but there are some people there who aren ’ t sure they even want the games . the tallest buildings in garmisch-partenkirchen near germany 's border with austria are churches , but they barely register on a landscape that is dominated by steep mountain foothills .
just outside of town , ski shops and hotels give way to farmland , bike trails , and horses grazing near a stream .
the town is germany 's most beloved ski resort , providing access to the country 's tallest mountain , the zugspitze .
it has an undeniable charm , but andreas keller , a 72-year-old retired professor , sees a looming threat to the small alpine resort town : the 2018 winter olympics .
" it 's a small alpine valley , " keller told deutsche welle .
" it 's not made for such a gigantic event . "
keller is part of a local volunteer campaign called nolympia , organized by members of the garmisch chapter of a bavarian environmental protection group .
nolympia is trying to keep garmisch-partenkirchen from being a junior partner in munich 's bid to host the 2018 winter olympics .
farmland in demand one of the biggest sticking points for nolympia is privately-owned farmland .
olympic organizers want to lease the land from the farmers and turn it into the athletes ' village .
andreas keller says the farmers are n't going to budge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas keller is worried the olympics will ruin garmisch " it 's not only the money .
it 's also the responsibility for the beauty of this valley , " he said .
" -lsb- the farmers -rsb- have a really good feeling that this must be kept and preserved . "
pointing at a map of garmisch that shows both developed areas of town and the undeveloped farmland , keller says as he 's watched his children and grandchildren grow up in garmisch , the green parts of the map keep getting smaller .
" garmisch is still a lovely town , but now a limit has been reached , " he said , adding that the city had decided to but a halt to the further development of farmland .
" now the rules should be broken for this one event ? "
the area should be preserved for future generations , keller says , not sacrificed for what he calls " a two week party for the international olympic committee . "
reinventing garmisch less than a mile from the farms andreas keller hopes to protect , black and white photos of local skiers from the past line the stone walls of the garmisch-partenkirchen city hall .
garmisch is no stranger to the olympics – it hosted the winter games in 1936 .
garmisch 's mayor , thomas schmid , hopes to see the games return in 2018 - and a boost in infrastructure development along with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch hosted the winter olympics in 1936 " a tourist resort like garmisch-partenkirchen has to invent itself more or less every 10 to 15 years anew , because we are in world-wide competition here , " he told deutsche welle .
" that 's why we need impulses and changes in infrastructure . "
a successful olympic bid would accelerate proposed infrastructure changes .
one example is a plan that would divert traffic between munich and the austrian city of innsbruck from the center of garmisch to a proposed mountain tunnel .
without the games , the mayor says this could take 30 years .
with the games , there would be a deadline of 2018 .
big winter sporting events are n't new to garmisch , either .
the town is set to host the 2011 alpine skiing world championships , and is involved in a german new year 's tradition , as host of one of the events of the four hills ski-jumping tournament .
" the new year 's jump on the first of january is the biggest sporting event , spectator-wise , that we have , " said schmid .
" the olympic events have even fewer spectators . "
the whistler role he admits that while any single day of the olympics may draw fewer spectators than the four hills tournament , there is a big difference in that the olympics go on for two weeks .
but with munich as the official host city , schmid thinks garmisch 's contribution would be much smaller , similar to whistler 's role during the vancouver olympics in canada .
" we wo n't have the hockey games where you have 20,000 people still waiting for the tickets -lsb- like they had in vancouver -rsb- , " schmid said .
" we 'll have it much calmer , much more traditional , and that 's why i 'm not afraid of organizing it here . "
even with resistance from nolympia and local farmers , schmid says garmisch 's olympic plans can be carried out even without the disputed farmland .
he says one percent of the available farm land in garmisch is under consideration , and they can simply build around any pieces of land that do n't get leased .
talking to the neighbors but people are starting to come around .
at a press conference in garmisch to announce a new sponsor of the munich bid application , the bid committee 's communications director jochen faerber says increased dialogue has led to more support for the games in garmisch .
" if you have a party in your apartment , you inform the neighbors before you do the party .
and i think maybe at the beginning , sometimes that was missed , " faerber told deutsche welle " i think that kind of communication has changed now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor schmid hopes the olympics will boost infrastructire projects resistance , however , is still there .
andreas keller and nolympia are collecting signatures for a local vote to decide once and for all if the people of garmisch want the olympics or not .
if garmisch is out , munich 's chances of getting the olympics nearly vanish as there is no other location to host the alpine skiing events .
a vote creeps into murky legal waters , though , as garmisch has already signed a number of contracts as a potential host site .
ultimately , the final word will come from the international olympic committee in july 2011 , when it will name either munich , the french town of annecy , or pyeongchang in south korea as the host of the 2018 winter olympics .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isar 1 plant is perhaps the most controversial of bavaria 's nuclear sites several political parties and action groups rallied people to join the demonstration , calling for a move away from nuclear energy towards renewable energy .
reprocessing idea abandoned the action was the biggest anti-nuclear event in bavaria in decades .
a rally against plans to build a nuclear reprocessing plant in wackersdorf in 1985 - which was later abandoned - was attended by 30,000 to 50,000 people .
organizers say around 100,000 people took part in a demonstration against the planned extensions in berlin in september .
police put the number at 40,000 .
a previous german government of the spd and green party decided to close all nuclear plants by 2021 , but the current coalition has plans to extend that deadline by an average of 12 years .

but there are some people there who aren ’ t sure they even want the games . the tallest buildings in garmisch-partenkirchen near germany 's border with austria are churches , but they barely register on a landscape that is dominated by steep mountain foothills .
just outside of town , ski shops and hotels give way to farmland , bike trails , and horses grazing near a stream .
the town is germany 's most beloved ski resort , providing access to the country 's tallest mountain , the zugspitze .
it has an undeniable charm , but andreas keller , a 72-year-old retired professor , sees a looming threat to the small alpine resort town : the 2018 winter olympics .
" it 's a small alpine valley , " keller told deutsche welle .
" it 's not made for such a gigantic event . "
keller is part of a local volunteer campaign called nolympia , organized by members of the garmisch chapter of a bavarian environmental protection group .
nolympia is trying to keep garmisch-partenkirchen from being a junior partner in munich 's bid to host the 2018 winter olympics .
farmland in demand one of the biggest sticking points for nolympia is privately-owned farmland .
olympic organizers want to lease the land from the farmers and turn it into the athletes ' village .
andreas keller says the farmers are n't going to budge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas keller is worried the olympics will ruin garmisch " it 's not only the money .
it 's also the responsibility for the beauty of this valley , " he said .
" -lsb- the farmers -rsb- have a really good feeling that this must be kept and preserved . "
pointing at a map of garmisch that shows both developed areas of town and the undeveloped farmland , keller says as he 's watched his children and grandchildren grow up in garmisch , the green parts of the map keep getting smaller .
" garmisch is still a lovely town , but now a limit has been reached , " he said , adding that the city had decided to but a halt to the further development of farmland .
" now the rules should be broken for this one event ? "
the area should be preserved for future generations , keller says , not sacrificed for what he calls " a two week party for the international olympic committee . "
reinventing garmisch less than a mile from the farms andreas keller hopes to protect , black and white photos of local skiers from the past line the stone walls of the garmisch-partenkirchen city hall .
garmisch is no stranger to the olympics – it hosted the winter games in 1936 .
garmisch 's mayor , thomas schmid , hopes to see the games return in 2018 - and a boost in infrastructure development along with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch hosted the winter olympics in 1936 " a tourist resort like garmisch-partenkirchen has to invent itself more or less every 10 to 15 years anew , because we are in world-wide competition here , " he told deutsche welle .
" that 's why we need impulses and changes in infrastructure . "
a successful olympic bid would accelerate proposed infrastructure changes .
one example is a plan that would divert traffic between munich and the austrian city of innsbruck from the center of garmisch to a proposed mountain tunnel .
without the games , the mayor says this could take 30 years .
with the games , there would be a deadline of 2018 .
big winter sporting events are n't new to garmisch , either .
the town is set to host the 2011 alpine skiing world championships , and is involved in a german new year 's tradition , as host of one of the events of the four hills ski-jumping tournament .
" the new year 's jump on the first of january is the biggest sporting event , spectator-wise , that we have , " said schmid .
" the olympic events have even fewer spectators . "
the whistler role he admits that while any single day of the olympics may draw fewer spectators than the four hills tournament , there is a big difference in that the olympics go on for two weeks .
but with munich as the official host city , schmid thinks garmisch 's contribution would be much smaller , similar to whistler 's role during the vancouver olympics in canada .
" we wo n't have the hockey games where you have 20,000 people still waiting for the tickets -lsb- like they had in vancouver -rsb- , " schmid said .
" we 'll have it much calmer , much more traditional , and that 's why i 'm not afraid of organizing it here . "
even with resistance from nolympia and local farmers , schmid says garmisch 's olympic plans can be carried out even without the disputed farmland .
he says one percent of the available farm land in garmisch is under consideration , and they can simply build around any pieces of land that do n't get leased .
talking to the neighbors but people are starting to come around .
at a press conference in garmisch to announce a new sponsor of the munich bid application , the bid committee 's communications director jochen faerber says increased dialogue has led to more support for the games in garmisch .
" if you have a party in your apartment , you inform the neighbors before you do the party .
and i think maybe at the beginning , sometimes that was missed , " faerber told deutsche welle " i think that kind of communication has changed now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor schmid hopes the olympics will boost infrastructire projects resistance , however , is still there .
andreas keller and nolympia are collecting signatures for a local vote to decide once and for all if the people of garmisch want the olympics or not .
if garmisch is out , munich 's chances of getting the olympics nearly vanish as there is no other location to host the alpine skiing events .
a vote creeps into murky legal waters , though , as garmisch has already signed a number of contracts as a potential host site .
ultimately , the final word will come from the international olympic committee in july 2011 , when it will name either munich , the french town of annecy , or pyeongchang in south korea as the host of the 2018 winter olympics .

iraqi christians are particularly fearful of the removal of the main barrier between them and their persecutors . their churches are burnt-out husks and heaps of rubble .
their businesses are targeted by extremists .
their leaders are kidnapped and assassinated .
the christian minority in iraq , once a community left in peace to prosper , continues to be under threat from a campaign of persecution which has forced as many as 500,000 christians to flee the country .
during the reign of saddam hussein , the estimated 1.4 million christians - many of them chaldean-assyrians and armenians , with small numbers of roman catholics - were generally left alone if they did n't oppose the government and they lived in relative peace with the country 's sunnis and shiites .
some , such as tariq aziz , saddam 's foreign minister and deputy prime minister , rose to the highest levels of power .
things changed after the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq toppled saddam 's regime .
christians became a target of violence when islamist groups and ordinary muslims angered by the military action began seeing them as the enemy , associating with them with the " crusaders " - the invading armies of the united states and britain .
tensions over their religious ties with the west and their differing beliefs to the strict islamic majority , which had been simmering for years , spilled over as the occupying forces dug in .
" iraqi christians became caught up in the overlapping violence and multiple conflicts unleashed after 2003 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , an iraq expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" they became exposed to the similar patterns of kidnappings , extortion , beheadings , rape and forced taxation that affected all other communities as the erosion of central government control left a security vacuum that was exploited by organised and opportunistic criminality and anti-occupation resistance groups . " " in addition to this , christians specifically were targeted by church bombings and assassination attempts owing to a perceived association with the aims and intentions of the occupying forces . " association with occupying powers makes christians targets in 2004 , insurgents launched a coordinated bombing campaign targeted churches in baghdad .
in 2007 , after pope benedict xvi made comments perceived to be anti-islam , nationwide attacks on churches hit an all-time high and a priest in the northern city of mosul was kidnapped and later found beheaded .
in january 2009 , 40 iraqi christians were killed and approximately 12,000 fled their homes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : churches have been targeted since the 2003 us-led invasion in february this year , at least 10 iraqi christians were killed by unknown gunmen in mosul as the country was preparing for the march 7 elections .
the escalating violence ahead of the ballot led to hundreds of iraqi christians taking to the streets in a number of protests , chanting slogans such as " stop the killing of christians . " during the years since the invasion , life for the christian minority has become beset by danger .
the waves of violent attacks against churches , businesses and homes have forced more than half of the christian population to flee for their lives , according to statistcs from the un high commission for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
those churches which remain standing are mostly empty , their congregations long gone or too afraid to attend . " the christian minority in iraq has been reduced to a shadow of its former self , " said ulrichsen .
" up to two-thirds of the pre-war community has been displaced or forced to flee the country .
although conditions in iraq have improved somewhat since 2007 , the security situation remains intensely fragile and prone to reversal , and the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes has been very slow and halting . " " there 's a real possibility that 2,000 years of settlement by christian communities in iraq is in danger of near-total extinction . " us withdrawal leave christians ' fate in iraqi hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congregations have dwindled through fear and exodus as the united states steps up its military withdrawal from iraq , the christian minority is forced to look at the iraqi security structure for protection .
however , the prospect of being protecetd by the iraqi police and armed forces fails to instill any confidence in the christian minority . " the greatest concern about a us pullout is that extremists will exploit any lapses in security and attack vulnerable groups , including christians , " samer muscati , an iraq expert from the middle east division at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . " although the iraqi government publicly condemns violence against christians and other minority groups , it has not taken measures to bolster security in areas where minorities are particularly vulnerable to attacks , and it has not thoroughly investigated attacks , " he added .
" iraqi security forces rarely apprehend , prosecute and punish perpetrators of such attacks , which has created a climate of impunity . " christians search for ways to protect themselves one muted proposal to protect the christian minority involves the creation of an autonomous province on a neglected area of land located to the north and west of mosul , called ninawah plain , which would act as a sanctuary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christians look for protection away from high-risk areas while advocates of the idea say it would n't stop the violence against christians in the large , high-risk cities of mosul , baghdad , and al-basrah , it would give the christians a place where their needs could be met , their beliefs supported and their security guaranteed . the proposals suggest that ninaweh plain would an autonomous administrative region in which the christian minority could govern themselves and would be free to participate in the federalist system which is developing in iraq . creation of autonomous region plagued by problems however , the idea of an autonomous region for the christian minority in reality looks unviable . " the image of a real autonomy is unrealistic , " nizar hanna , director of the assyrian democratic movement 's baghdad office , told deutsche welle .
" up to now , there are no concrete plans which show how this would work .
even in the kurdish constitution , they have the right to autonomy in the areas where they are the majority but nowhere is this the case .
besides , there are no areas in which only christians live .
shabak , yazidis , kurds and arabs also live there . " " to an extent a safe haven for christians exists in iraqi kurdistan , " kristian ulrichsen said .
" thousands of internally displaced iraqi christians have moved there .
although viable on humanitarian grounds , the creation of a specific region for christians would be a short-term measure that does not offer a longer-term solution to the reconstruction of iraqi society and the reintegration of its communities .

his ensemble is orchestra-in-residence at this year 's beethovenfest bonn . conductor paavo jarvi has received numerous awards , including a grammy and an echo classic conductor of the year distinction in 2010 .
born in estonia , he moved to the united states , where he studied with leonard bernstein . he is currently music director of both the cincinnati symphony orchestra and the frankfurt radio symphony orchestra .
since 2004 , he 's been artistic director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie -lrb- german chamber philharmonic -rrb- of bremen , the beethovenfest 's orchestra-in-residence .
deutsche welle spoke with jarvi about the aims of the festival and the feeling behind the music performed there . deutsche welle : there is an ongoing relationship between the deutsche kammerphilharmonie and the beethovenfest , with the kammerphilharmonie being the orchestra-in-residence .
has this collaboration influenced the culture and development of this body of musicians ? paavo jarvi : an orchestra that functions on a self-governing basis as we do needs good friends and good partners .
and certainly the beethovenfest in bonn has been a fantastic partner .
it does help to have a festival that is well run , has a good infrastructure , and has - most importantly - a real guiding light .
i mean by that -lsb- beethovenfest director -rsb- ilona schmiel , who is an enormous source of energy .
her imagination and her interest in doing something new are really fantastic . we know that beethoven did n't have fond memories of bonn .
but is there something here , in the public and the atmosphere or in the expectations of the people , that strikes you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn is home to the annual beethovenfest the festival has established itself as a place that really makes beethoven its center .
and let 's face it : we 're performing in a relatively modern hall , and the city is obviously different from when beethoven was walking around here .
but that is not so important .
what is important is that the idea lives , the idea is strong , and -lsb- bonn -rsb- is the right place to create a festival around beethoven , because it is his birthplace .
and to me , the real souls of the festival are the ones who create it .
what beethoven thought about the city when he was here is almost irrelevant . this year 's beethovenfest also focuses on works by composer robert schumann .
what is there to discover about such a frequently performed composer ? it 's the type of gestures that schumann makes in his music - emotional , dramatic gestures that communicate to you with such directness and sincerity .
and there 's that impulsive , neurotic energy , the extremes of expression , the moments that can go to unbelievable euphoria and , a second later , -lsb- to -rsb- the deepest , darkest melancholy . to wear your heart on your sleeve in public , and go from one extreme to another and not be ashamed of it , is something that we have always been taught to be wrong .
we 're uncomfortable with that .
what we are trying to do with the kammerphilharmonie is to bring out just this aspect .
music by schumann needs to be exaggerated on every level .
exaggerated , not put into an acceptable , comfortable norm . against the backdrop of thousands of recordings , and many , many others who have preceded you , do you feel the need to shake up the routine ? one of the most difficult things i find , in general , is changing old habits .
people who have grown up with brahms and schumann and beethoven have heard , so many times , those pieces in a certain way .
they are simply so engrained that even if -lsb- these people -rsb- sometimes intellectually try to change something , when it comes to performance , they often fall back to those gestures that they heard when they were young .
you simply need to have enough time and repetition to create a new tradition and make it your own . that is something that is doable , especially if we do these beethoven and schumann " total immersion courses " - all symphonies in three days , or all schumann symphonies and overtures in two days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playing a cycle , like all beethoven symphonies , brings you amazingly close to the composer , says jarvi it 's amazing how close you can get to a composer if you really make an incredibly concentrated program of it and follow some principles and see how they work in other symphonies , overtures and so on .
it gradually becomes a language that you identify with , not just intellectually ; it becomes part of your genetics . would you prefer to shake up the routine or to strive for an authoritative interpretation ? l do n't want to change things per se or to create something that has n't been done .
quite the opposite .
i want to do something that makes sense to me .
the only reason i rethink certain things is because they never made sense to me to begin with . maybe one of the reasons our beethoven is successful is that we do keep a lot of tradition in it .
it has to be organic and it has to have an inner logic . interview : rick fulker editor : elaine yeung / louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his ensemble is orchestra-in-residence at this year 's beethovenfest bonn . conductor paavo jarvi has received numerous awards , including a grammy and an echo classic conductor of the year distinction in 2010 .
born in estonia , he moved to the united states , where he studied with leonard bernstein . he is currently music director of both the cincinnati symphony orchestra and the frankfurt radio symphony orchestra .
since 2004 , he 's been artistic director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie -lrb- german chamber philharmonic -rrb- of bremen , the beethovenfest 's orchestra-in-residence .
deutsche welle spoke with jarvi about the aims of the festival and the feeling behind the music performed there . deutsche welle : there is an ongoing relationship between the deutsche kammerphilharmonie and the beethovenfest , with the kammerphilharmonie being the orchestra-in-residence .
has this collaboration influenced the culture and development of this body of musicians ? paavo jarvi : an orchestra that functions on a self-governing basis as we do needs good friends and good partners .
and certainly the beethovenfest in bonn has been a fantastic partner .
it does help to have a festival that is well run , has a good infrastructure , and has - most importantly - a real guiding light .
i mean by that -lsb- beethovenfest director -rsb- ilona schmiel , who is an enormous source of energy .
her imagination and her interest in doing something new are really fantastic . we know that beethoven did n't have fond memories of bonn .
but is there something here , in the public and the atmosphere or in the expectations of the people , that strikes you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn is home to the annual beethovenfest the festival has established itself as a place that really makes beethoven its center .
and let 's face it : we 're performing in a relatively modern hall , and the city is obviously different from when beethoven was walking around here .
but that is not so important .
what is important is that the idea lives , the idea is strong , and -lsb- bonn -rsb- is the right place to create a festival around beethoven , because it is his birthplace .
and to me , the real souls of the festival are the ones who create it .
what beethoven thought about the city when he was here is almost irrelevant . this year 's beethovenfest also focuses on works by composer robert schumann .
what is there to discover about such a frequently performed composer ? it 's the type of gestures that schumann makes in his music - emotional , dramatic gestures that communicate to you with such directness and sincerity .
and there 's that impulsive , neurotic energy , the extremes of expression , the moments that can go to unbelievable euphoria and , a second later , -lsb- to -rsb- the deepest , darkest melancholy . to wear your heart on your sleeve in public , and go from one extreme to another and not be ashamed of it , is something that we have always been taught to be wrong .
we 're uncomfortable with that .
what we are trying to do with the kammerphilharmonie is to bring out just this aspect .
music by schumann needs to be exaggerated on every level .
exaggerated , not put into an acceptable , comfortable norm . against the backdrop of thousands of recordings , and many , many others who have preceded you , do you feel the need to shake up the routine ? one of the most difficult things i find , in general , is changing old habits .
people who have grown up with brahms and schumann and beethoven have heard , so many times , those pieces in a certain way .
they are simply so engrained that even if -lsb- these people -rsb- sometimes intellectually try to change something , when it comes to performance , they often fall back to those gestures that they heard when they were young .
you simply need to have enough time and repetition to create a new tradition and make it your own . that is something that is doable , especially if we do these beethoven and schumann " total immersion courses " - all symphonies in three days , or all schumann symphonies and overtures in two days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playing a cycle , like all beethoven symphonies , brings you amazingly close to the composer , says jarvi it 's amazing how close you can get to a composer if you really make an incredibly concentrated program of it and follow some principles and see how they work in other symphonies , overtures and so on .
it gradually becomes a language that you identify with , not just intellectually ; it becomes part of your genetics . would you prefer to shake up the routine or to strive for an authoritative interpretation ? l do n't want to change things per se or to create something that has n't been done .
quite the opposite .
i want to do something that makes sense to me .
the only reason i rethink certain things is because they never made sense to me to begin with . maybe one of the reasons our beethoven is successful is that we do keep a lot of tradition in it .
it has to be organic and it has to have an inner logic . interview : rick fulker editor : elaine yeung / louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the event was the largest of its kind in bavaria for more than two decades . tens of thousands of people turned out on the streets of munich on saturday against the nuclear power policy of chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government .
a focus of the protest was the formation of a human chain , about 10 kilometers long , through the center of the city .
organizers said that some 50,000 people in all took part in the day 's events , while police put the number at around 25,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel claimed the protest showed the nuclear policy was deeply unpopular " it is an enormous success for us , " said marcus greineder , chief organizer of the bavaria chain reaction group , which organized the protest .
the heart of the demonstration was the city 's odeonsplatz , where a stage was set up to rally the crowd .
public ' simply does not accept ' social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader sigmar gabriel said that the turnout revealed the level of opposition to a planned extension to the operating lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" this shows once again that the population simply does n't accept government 's lobby group policy in favor of nuclear firms . "
five bavarian nuclear plants are affected by the extension , among them the particularly controversial isar 1 reactor which has been in use since 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isar 1 plant is perhaps the most controversial of bavaria 's nuclear sites several political parties and action groups rallied people to join the demonstration , calling for a move away from nuclear energy towards renewable energy .
reprocessing idea abandoned the action was the biggest anti-nuclear event in bavaria in decades .
a rally against plans to build a nuclear reprocessing plant in wackersdorf in 1985 - which was later abandoned - was attended by 30,000 to 50,000 people .
organizers say around 100,000 people took part in a demonstration against the planned extensions in berlin in september .
police put the number at 40,000 .
a previous german government of the spd and green party decided to close all nuclear plants by 2021 , but the current coalition has plans to extend that deadline by an average of 12 years .

fears for the danube river have eased since the accident , with polution levels down . fears that the danube river , the second longest in europe , could become contaminated after a toxic sludge spill have eased after hungarian authorities claimed that pollution levels in the river have dropped since thursday .
tibor dobson , the regional chief of hungary 's disaster relief services , said fresh data showed acidity levels - or ph - of around 8.2 in the danube , which could be considered " normal , " down from a level of around 9 when the sludge reached the river on thursday .
" these data give us hope ... and we have not experienced any damage on the main danube so far , " dobson told news agency reuters .
further upstream at the confluence of the raba and the danube , which is closer to the site of the disaster , ph levels showed a reading of 9 and there were also still sporadic sightings of dead fish , officials said .
environmental group greenpeace said in a statement on friday that levels of arsenic and mercury detected in samples of the red sludge taken on tuesday were still twice that normally found in so-called red mud .
the death toll following monday 's toxic spill rose to seven late friday after a body was found in a sludge-covered area , while another man died in hospital of injuries sustained in the spill .
more than 150 others were injured after the reservoir burst its banks at a rural alumina plant sending around 700,000 cubic meters -lrb- 24,720,000 cubic feet -rrb- of sludge streaming through nearby villages .
the pollution already wiped out all life in the smaller marcal tributary and there were fears it could spread down the danube to hungary 's southern neighbors .
eu answers call for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the areas hit by the spill will be uninhabitable , officials say on friday , hungary asked the european commission to contribute at least three experts under the bloc 's joint civil protection assistance measures to aid authorities with the cleanup efforts .
according to a statement on the european union ’ s website , several eu countries were forthcoming with offers to send disaster management experts .
it said hungary was awaiting the arrival on saturday morning of a liaison officer from the monitoring and information center of the european commission who would be responsible for coordinating the experts once they were on the ground in the contaminated areas .
despite the call for expertise , prime minister viktor orban earlier had insisted that the eu member country does not need financial assistance in removing the red slurry containing poisonous heavy metals from villages , fields and rivers .
orban conceded that , in some places , such as the hard-hit village of kolontar , there was little point in removing rubble left behind by the spill as habitation of the areas would no longer be possible .

further upstream at the confluence of the raba and the danube , which is closer to the site of the disaster , ph levels showed a reading of 9 and there were also still sporadic sightings of dead fish , officials said .
environmental group greenpeace said in a statement on friday that levels of arsenic and mercury detected in samples of the red sludge taken on tuesday were still twice that normally found in so-called red mud .
the death toll following monday 's toxic spill rose to seven late friday after a body was found in a sludge-covered area , while another man died in hospital of injuries sustained in the spill .
more than 150 others were injured after the reservoir burst its banks at a rural alumina plant sending around 700,000 cubic meters -lrb- 24,720,000 cubic feet -rrb- of sludge streaming through nearby villages .
the pollution already wiped out all life in the smaller marcal tributary and there were fears it could spread down the danube to hungary 's southern neighbors .
eu answers call for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the areas hit by the spill will be uninhabitable , officials say on friday , hungary asked the european commission to contribute at least three experts under the bloc 's joint civil protection assistance measures to aid authorities with the cleanup efforts .
according to a statement on the european union ’ s website , several eu countries were forthcoming with offers to send disaster management experts .
it said hungary was awaiting the arrival on saturday morning of a liaison officer from the monitoring and information center of the european commission who would be responsible for coordinating the experts once they were on the ground in the contaminated areas .
despite the call for expertise , prime minister viktor orban earlier had insisted that the eu member country does not need financial assistance in removing the red slurry containing poisonous heavy metals from villages , fields and rivers .
orban conceded that , in some places , such as the hard-hit village of kolontar , there was little point in removing rubble left behind by the spill as habitation of the areas would no longer be possible .

the heart of the demonstration was the city 's odeonsplatz , where a stage was set up to rally the crowd .
public ' simply does not accept ' social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader sigmar gabriel said that the turnout revealed the level of opposition to a planned extension to the operating lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" this shows once again that the population simply does n't accept government 's lobby group policy in favor of nuclear firms . "

a rally against plans to build a nuclear reprocessing plant in wackersdorf in 1985 - which was later abandoned - was attended by 30,000 to 50,000 people .
organizers say around 100,000 people took part in a demonstration against the planned extensions in berlin in september .
police put the number at 40,000 .
a previous german government of the spd and green party decided to close all nuclear plants by 2021 , but the current coalition has plans to extend that deadline by an average of 12 years .

this comes as the country awaits a team of eu pollution cleanup experts . disaster management officials in hungary have moved to evacuate the village of kolontar over concerns it may be exposed to a second toxic waste leak from a nearby red sludge reservoir . tibor dobson , the regional chief of hungary 's disaster relief services , said the damaged section of the reservoir has further weakened and was at risk of complete collapse , threatening the village . " the evacuation of kolontar began at six in the morning -lsb- 4:00 a.m.
gmt -rsb- after we noticed a weakening in one of the reservoir 's dykes , " dobson said .
" the decision to evacuate was taken by interior minister sandor pinter , who took part in the meeting of the local defense committee early saturday . " dobson added that the neighboring village of devecser was also under consideration for evacuation . hungarian prime minister victor orban also said it was likely the alumina sludge reservoir 's weakened wall would fall . " last night the interior minister informed us that cracks have appeared on the northern wall of the reservoir , whose corner collapsed , which make it likely that the entire wall will collapse , " orban told reporters . seven people were killed and more than 150 others injured after the reservoir of a separate alumina plant burst its banks on monday sending around 700,000 cubic meters -lrb- 24,720,000 cubic feet -rrb- of sludge streaming through nearby villages and fields . the pollution wiped out all life in the marcal tributary river and there were fears it could spread down the danube river , europe 's second largest , and on to hungary 's southern neighbors .
those concerns have since eased , with hungarian authorities releasing fresh data on friday showing acidity levels - or ph - of around 8.2 in the danube , which could be considered " normal , " down from a level of around 9 when the sludge reached the river on thursday . environmental group greenpeace said in a statement on friday , however , that levels of arsenic and mercury detected in samples of the red sludge taken on tuesday were still twice that normally found in so-called red mud . eu answers call for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plaster was poured into the marcal to neutralize the toxic sludge the disaster prompted hungary on friday to ask the european commission to contribute at least three experts under the bloc 's joint civil protection assistance measures to aid authorities with cleanup efforts . according to a statement on the european union 's website , several eu countries were forthcoming with offers to send disaster management experts .
it said hungary was awaiting the arrival on saturday morning of a liaison officer from the monitoring and information center of the european commission who would be responsible for coordinating the experts once they were on the ground in the contaminated areas . despite the call for expertise , orban earlier had insisted that the eu member country does not need financial assistance in removing the red slurry containing poisonous heavy metals from villages , fields and rivers . orban conceded that , in some places , such as the hard-hit village of kolontar , there was little point in removing rubble left behind by the spill as habitation of the areas would no longer be possible . author : darren mara -lrb- afp / ap / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de winter sports -pipe- 09.10.2010 munich 's 2018 olympic bid hinges on alpine town of garmisch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this meadow is a proposed site for the athletes ' village if munich wins the bid to host the 2018 winter olympics , about half of the events will take place in the alpine town of garmisch-partenkirchen .
but there are some people there who aren ’ t sure they even want the games . the tallest buildings in garmisch-partenkirchen near germany 's border with austria are churches , but they barely register on a landscape that is dominated by steep mountain foothills .
just outside of town , ski shops and hotels give way to farmland , bike trails , and horses grazing near a stream .
the town is germany 's most beloved ski resort , providing access to the country 's tallest mountain , the zugspitze .
it has an undeniable charm , but andreas keller , a 72-year-old retired professor , sees a looming threat to the small alpine resort town : the 2018 winter olympics .
" it 's a small alpine valley , " keller told deutsche welle .
" it 's not made for such a gigantic event . "
keller is part of a local volunteer campaign called nolympia , organized by members of the garmisch chapter of a bavarian environmental protection group .
nolympia is trying to keep garmisch-partenkirchen from being a junior partner in munich 's bid to host the 2018 winter olympics .
farmland in demand one of the biggest sticking points for nolympia is privately-owned farmland .
olympic organizers want to lease the land from the farmers and turn it into the athletes ' village .
andreas keller says the farmers are n't going to budge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas keller is worried the olympics will ruin garmisch " it 's not only the money .
it 's also the responsibility for the beauty of this valley , " he said .
" -lsb- the farmers -rsb- have a really good feeling that this must be kept and preserved . "
pointing at a map of garmisch that shows both developed areas of town and the undeveloped farmland , keller says as he 's watched his children and grandchildren grow up in garmisch , the green parts of the map keep getting smaller .
" garmisch is still a lovely town , but now a limit has been reached , " he said , adding that the city had decided to but a halt to the further development of farmland .
" now the rules should be broken for this one event ? "
the area should be preserved for future generations , keller says , not sacrificed for what he calls " a two week party for the international olympic committee . "
reinventing garmisch less than a mile from the farms andreas keller hopes to protect , black and white photos of local skiers from the past line the stone walls of the garmisch-partenkirchen city hall .
garmisch is no stranger to the olympics – it hosted the winter games in 1936 .
garmisch 's mayor , thomas schmid , hopes to see the games return in 2018 - and a boost in infrastructure development along with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch hosted the winter olympics in 1936 " a tourist resort like garmisch-partenkirchen has to invent itself more or less every 10 to 15 years anew , because we are in world-wide competition here , " he told deutsche welle .
" that 's why we need impulses and changes in infrastructure . "
a successful olympic bid would accelerate proposed infrastructure changes .
one example is a plan that would divert traffic between munich and the austrian city of innsbruck from the center of garmisch to a proposed mountain tunnel .
without the games , the mayor says this could take 30 years .
with the games , there would be a deadline of 2018 .
big winter sporting events are n't new to garmisch , either .
the town is set to host the 2011 alpine skiing world championships , and is involved in a german new year 's tradition , as host of one of the events of the four hills ski-jumping tournament .
" the new year 's jump on the first of january is the biggest sporting event , spectator-wise , that we have , " said schmid .
" the olympic events have even fewer spectators . "
the whistler role he admits that while any single day of the olympics may draw fewer spectators than the four hills tournament , there is a big difference in that the olympics go on for two weeks .
but with munich as the official host city , schmid thinks garmisch 's contribution would be much smaller , similar to whistler 's role during the vancouver olympics in canada .
" we wo n't have the hockey games where you have 20,000 people still waiting for the tickets -lsb- like they had in vancouver -rsb- , " schmid said .
" we 'll have it much calmer , much more traditional , and that 's why i 'm not afraid of organizing it here . "
even with resistance from nolympia and local farmers , schmid says garmisch 's olympic plans can be carried out even without the disputed farmland .
he says one percent of the available farm land in garmisch is under consideration , and they can simply build around any pieces of land that do n't get leased .
talking to the neighbors but people are starting to come around .
at a press conference in garmisch to announce a new sponsor of the munich bid application , the bid committee 's communications director jochen faerber says increased dialogue has led to more support for the games in garmisch .

andreas keller and nolympia are collecting signatures for a local vote to decide once and for all if the people of garmisch want the olympics or not .
if garmisch is out , munich 's chances of getting the olympics nearly vanish as there is no other location to host the alpine skiing events .
a vote creeps into murky legal waters , though , as garmisch has already signed a number of contracts as a potential host site .
ultimately , the final word will come from the international olympic committee in july 2011 , when it will name either munich , the french town of annecy , or pyeongchang in south korea as the host of the 2018 winter olympics .

among them was the integration of muslims in germany , a much-debated topic in recent weeks . talks between german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in berlin on saturday turned to the current debate in germany about immigrant integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the theme of muslim integration has been a hot topic lately both leaders pledged more to improve the integration of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish minority after the issue became a focus of public discussion .
following the meeting , merkel said germany should use the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between germany and turkey to take a look at the ongoing problems of integrating immigrant groups .
" we propose that everywhere in cities and towns where there are people of turkish origin , we use this event as a way of taking stock and seeing where we are and what has to be done , " merkel told reporters , adding that there were still problems to be addressed and that turkey was a willing and constructive partner .
" assimilation is not on our agenda , this is about integration , " merkel added , stressing that learning the german language was integral for the employment opportunities of young turks living in europe 's largest country .

"
the integration debate in germany has flared in recent months after a central banker said germany was becoming " more stupid , " claiming immigrants from muslim nations are poorly educated and unproductive .
talks also focused on bilateral ties , the situation in turkey following september 's constitutional referendum , security issues and ankara 's eu membership bid .
erdogan told a joint news conference with merkel that turkey 's bid to enter the eu must not be allowed to slow , addressing concerns that some eu members are stalling entry of a muslim country to the club .
the two leaders met over breakfast in berlin after the previous night 's euro 2012 football qualifying match in the city , where germany beat turkey 3-0 .
' no clear prospect ' for eu membership prior to his visit , erdogan accused the eu of failing to provide his country with a clear prospect of joining the bloc .

a representative emnid survey conducted last week showed that 69 percent of germans oppose eu membership for turkey .
meanwhile , horst seehofer , the head of the conservative christian social union party and state premier of bavaria , has called for a restriction of immigration to germany from certain cultures .

among them was the integration of muslims in germany , a much-debated topic in recent weeks . talks between german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in berlin on saturday turned to the current debate in germany about immigrant integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the theme of muslim integration has been a hot topic lately both leaders pledged more to improve the integration of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish minority after the issue became a focus of public discussion .
following the meeting , merkel said germany should use the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between germany and turkey to take a look at the ongoing problems of integrating immigrant groups .
" we propose that everywhere in cities and towns where there are people of turkish origin , we use this event as a way of taking stock and seeing where we are and what has to be done , " merkel told reporters , adding that there were still problems to be addressed and that turkey was a willing and constructive partner .
" assimilation is not on our agenda , this is about integration , " merkel added , stressing that learning the german language was integral for the employment opportunities of young turks living in europe 's largest country .
wulff comments praised erdogan , meanwhile , said the integration of some 2 million turkish people living in germany was " very important , " and that both countries needed to take a closer look at what could be done to advance the process .

"
the integration debate in germany has flared in recent months after a central banker said germany was becoming " more stupid , " claiming immigrants from muslim nations are poorly educated and unproductive .
talks also focused on bilateral ties , the situation in turkey following september 's constitutional referendum , security issues and ankara 's eu membership bid .
erdogan told a joint news conference with merkel that turkey 's bid to enter the eu must not be allowed to slow , addressing concerns that some eu members are stalling entry of a muslim country to the club .
the two leaders met over breakfast in berlin after the previous night 's euro 2012 football qualifying match in the city , where germany beat turkey 3-0 .
' no clear prospect ' for eu membership prior to his visit , erdogan accused the eu of failing to provide his country with a clear prospect of joining the bloc .

meanwhile , horst seehofer , the head of the conservative christian social union party and state premier of bavaria , has called for a restriction of immigration to germany from certain cultures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de winter sports -pipe- 09.10.2010 munich 's 2018 olympic bid hinges on alpine town of garmisch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this meadow is a proposed site for the athletes ' village if munich wins the bid to host the 2018 winter olympics , about half of the events will take place in the alpine town of garmisch-partenkirchen .
but there are some people there who aren ’ t sure they even want the games . the tallest buildings in garmisch-partenkirchen near germany 's border with austria are churches , but they barely register on a landscape that is dominated by steep mountain foothills .
just outside of town , ski shops and hotels give way to farmland , bike trails , and horses grazing near a stream .
the town is germany 's most beloved ski resort , providing access to the country 's tallest mountain , the zugspitze .
it has an undeniable charm , but andreas keller , a 72-year-old retired professor , sees a looming threat to the small alpine resort town : the 2018 winter olympics .
" it 's a small alpine valley , " keller told deutsche welle .
" it 's not made for such a gigantic event . "
keller is part of a local volunteer campaign called nolympia , organized by members of the garmisch chapter of a bavarian environmental protection group .
nolympia is trying to keep garmisch-partenkirchen from being a junior partner in munich 's bid to host the 2018 winter olympics .
farmland in demand one of the biggest sticking points for nolympia is privately-owned farmland .
olympic organizers want to lease the land from the farmers and turn it into the athletes ' village .
andreas keller says the farmers are n't going to budge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas keller is worried the olympics will ruin garmisch " it 's not only the money .
it 's also the responsibility for the beauty of this valley , " he said .
" -lsb- the farmers -rsb- have a really good feeling that this must be kept and preserved . "
pointing at a map of garmisch that shows both developed areas of town and the undeveloped farmland , keller says as he 's watched his children and grandchildren grow up in garmisch , the green parts of the map keep getting smaller .
" garmisch is still a lovely town , but now a limit has been reached , " he said , adding that the city had decided to but a halt to the further development of farmland .
" now the rules should be broken for this one event ? "
the area should be preserved for future generations , keller says , not sacrificed for what he calls " a two week party for the international olympic committee . "
reinventing garmisch less than a mile from the farms andreas keller hopes to protect , black and white photos of local skiers from the past line the stone walls of the garmisch-partenkirchen city hall .
garmisch is no stranger to the olympics – it hosted the winter games in 1936 .
garmisch 's mayor , thomas schmid , hopes to see the games return in 2018 - and a boost in infrastructure development along with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch hosted the winter olympics in 1936 " a tourist resort like garmisch-partenkirchen has to invent itself more or less every 10 to 15 years anew , because we are in world-wide competition here , " he told deutsche welle .
" that 's why we need impulses and changes in infrastructure . "
a successful olympic bid would accelerate proposed infrastructure changes .
one example is a plan that would divert traffic between munich and the austrian city of innsbruck from the center of garmisch to a proposed mountain tunnel .
without the games , the mayor says this could take 30 years .
with the games , there would be a deadline of 2018 .
big winter sporting events are n't new to garmisch , either .
the town is set to host the 2011 alpine skiing world championships , and is involved in a german new year 's tradition , as host of one of the events of the four hills ski-jumping tournament .
" the new year 's jump on the first of january is the biggest sporting event , spectator-wise , that we have , " said schmid .
" the olympic events have even fewer spectators . "
the whistler role he admits that while any single day of the olympics may draw fewer spectators than the four hills tournament , there is a big difference in that the olympics go on for two weeks .
but with munich as the official host city , schmid thinks garmisch 's contribution would be much smaller , similar to whistler 's role during the vancouver olympics in canada .
" we wo n't have the hockey games where you have 20,000 people still waiting for the tickets -lsb- like they had in vancouver -rsb- , " schmid said .
" we 'll have it much calmer , much more traditional , and that 's why i 'm not afraid of organizing it here . "
even with resistance from nolympia and local farmers , schmid says garmisch 's olympic plans can be carried out even without the disputed farmland .
he says one percent of the available farm land in garmisch is under consideration , and they can simply build around any pieces of land that do n't get leased .
talking to the neighbors but people are starting to come around .
at a press conference in garmisch to announce a new sponsor of the munich bid application , the bid committee 's communications director jochen faerber says increased dialogue has led to more support for the games in garmisch .
" if you have a party in your apartment , you inform the neighbors before you do the party .
and i think maybe at the beginning , sometimes that was missed , " faerber told deutsche welle " i think that kind of communication has changed now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor schmid hopes the olympics will boost infrastructire projects resistance , however , is still there .
andreas keller and nolympia are collecting signatures for a local vote to decide once and for all if the people of garmisch want the olympics or not .
if garmisch is out , munich 's chances of getting the olympics nearly vanish as there is no other location to host the alpine skiing events .
a vote creeps into murky legal waters , though , as garmisch has already signed a number of contracts as a potential host site .
ultimately , the final word will come from the international olympic committee in july 2011 , when it will name either munich , the french town of annecy , or pyeongchang in south korea as the host of the 2018 winter olympics .

the event was the largest of its kind in bavaria for more than two decades . tens of thousands of people turned out on the streets of munich on saturday against the nuclear power policy of chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government .
a focus of the protest was the formation of a human chain , about 10 kilometers long , through the center of the city .
organizers said that some 50,000 people in all took part in the day 's events , while police put the number at around 25,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel claimed the protest showed the nuclear policy was deeply unpopular " it is an enormous success for us , " said marcus greineder , chief organizer of the bavaria chain reaction group , which organized the protest .
the heart of the demonstration was the city 's odeonsplatz , where a stage was set up to rally the crowd .
public ' simply does not accept ' social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader sigmar gabriel said that the turnout revealed the level of opposition to a planned extension to the operating lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" this shows once again that the population simply does n't accept government 's lobby group policy in favor of nuclear firms . "
five bavarian nuclear plants are affected by the extension , among them the particularly controversial isar 1 reactor which has been in use since 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isar 1 plant is perhaps the most controversial of bavaria 's nuclear sites several political parties and action groups rallied people to join the demonstration , calling for a move away from nuclear energy towards renewable energy .
reprocessing idea abandoned the action was the biggest anti-nuclear event in bavaria in decades .
a rally against plans to build a nuclear reprocessing plant in wackersdorf in 1985 - which was later abandoned - was attended by 30,000 to 50,000 people .
organizers say around 100,000 people took part in a demonstration against the planned extensions in berlin in september .
police put the number at 40,000 .
a previous german government of the spd and green party decided to close all nuclear plants by 2021 , but the current coalition has plans to extend that deadline by an average of 12 years .

iraqi christians are particularly fearful of the removal of the main barrier between them and their persecutors . their churches are burnt-out husks and heaps of rubble .
their businesses are targeted by extremists .
their leaders are kidnapped and assassinated .
the christian minority in iraq , once a community left in peace to prosper , continues to be under threat from a campaign of persecution which has forced as many as 500,000 christians to flee the country .
during the reign of saddam hussein , the estimated 1.4 million christians - many of them chaldean-assyrians and armenians , with small numbers of roman catholics - were generally left alone if they did n't oppose the government and they lived in relative peace with the country 's sunnis and shiites .
some , such as tariq aziz , saddam 's foreign minister and deputy prime minister , rose to the highest levels of power .
things changed after the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq toppled saddam 's regime .
christians became a target of violence when islamist groups and ordinary muslims angered by the military action began seeing them as the enemy , associating with them with the " crusaders " - the invading armies of the united states and britain .

iraqi christians are particularly fearful of the removal of the main barrier between them and their persecutors . their churches are burnt-out husks and heaps of rubble .
their businesses are targeted by extremists .
their leaders are kidnapped and assassinated .
the christian minority in iraq , once a community left in peace to prosper , continues to be under threat from a campaign of persecution which has forced as many as 500,000 christians to flee the country .
during the reign of saddam hussein , the estimated 1.4 million christians - many of them chaldean-assyrians and armenians , with small numbers of roman catholics - were generally left alone if they did n't oppose the government and they lived in relative peace with the country 's sunnis and shiites .
some , such as tariq aziz , saddam 's foreign minister and deputy prime minister , rose to the highest levels of power .
things changed after the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq toppled saddam 's regime .
christians became a target of violence when islamist groups and ordinary muslims angered by the military action began seeing them as the enemy , associating with them with the " crusaders " - the invading armies of the united states and britain .
tensions over their religious ties with the west and their differing beliefs to the strict islamic majority , which had been simmering for years , spilled over as the occupying forces dug in .

his ensemble is orchestra-in-residence at this year 's beethovenfest bonn . conductor paavo jarvi has received numerous awards , including a grammy and an echo classic conductor of the year distinction in 2010 .
born in estonia , he moved to the united states , where he studied with leonard bernstein . he is currently music director of both the cincinnati symphony orchestra and the frankfurt radio symphony orchestra .
since 2004 , he 's been artistic director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie -lrb- german chamber philharmonic -rrb- of bremen , the beethovenfest 's orchestra-in-residence .
deutsche welle spoke with jarvi about the aims of the festival and the feeling behind the music performed there . deutsche welle : there is an ongoing relationship between the deutsche kammerphilharmonie and the beethovenfest , with the kammerphilharmonie being the orchestra-in-residence .
has this collaboration influenced the culture and development of this body of musicians ? paavo jarvi : an orchestra that functions on a self-governing basis as we do needs good friends and good partners .
and certainly the beethovenfest in bonn has been a fantastic partner .
it does help to have a festival that is well run , has a good infrastructure , and has - most importantly - a real guiding light .
i mean by that -lsb- beethovenfest director -rsb- ilona schmiel , who is an enormous source of energy .
her imagination and her interest in doing something new are really fantastic . we know that beethoven did n't have fond memories of bonn .
but is there something here , in the public and the atmosphere or in the expectations of the people , that strikes you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn is home to the annual beethovenfest the festival has established itself as a place that really makes beethoven its center .
and let 's face it : we 're performing in a relatively modern hall , and the city is obviously different from when beethoven was walking around here .
but that is not so important .
what is important is that the idea lives , the idea is strong , and -lsb- bonn -rsb- is the right place to create a festival around beethoven , because it is his birthplace .
and to me , the real souls of the festival are the ones who create it .
what beethoven thought about the city when he was here is almost irrelevant . this year 's beethovenfest also focuses on works by composer robert schumann .
what is there to discover about such a frequently performed composer ? it 's the type of gestures that schumann makes in his music - emotional , dramatic gestures that communicate to you with such directness and sincerity .
and there 's that impulsive , neurotic energy , the extremes of expression , the moments that can go to unbelievable euphoria and , a second later , -lsb- to -rsb- the deepest , darkest melancholy . to wear your heart on your sleeve in public , and go from one extreme to another and not be ashamed of it , is something that we have always been taught to be wrong .
we 're uncomfortable with that .
what we are trying to do with the kammerphilharmonie is to bring out just this aspect .
music by schumann needs to be exaggerated on every level .
exaggerated , not put into an acceptable , comfortable norm . against the backdrop of thousands of recordings , and many , many others who have preceded you , do you feel the need to shake up the routine ? one of the most difficult things i find , in general , is changing old habits .
people who have grown up with brahms and schumann and beethoven have heard , so many times , those pieces in a certain way .
they are simply so engrained that even if -lsb- these people -rsb- sometimes intellectually try to change something , when it comes to performance , they often fall back to those gestures that they heard when they were young .
you simply need to have enough time and repetition to create a new tradition and make it your own . that is something that is doable , especially if we do these beethoven and schumann " total immersion courses " - all symphonies in three days , or all schumann symphonies and overtures in two days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playing a cycle , like all beethoven symphonies , brings you amazingly close to the composer , says jarvi it 's amazing how close you can get to a composer if you really make an incredibly concentrated program of it and follow some principles and see how they work in other symphonies , overtures and so on .
it gradually becomes a language that you identify with , not just intellectually ; it becomes part of your genetics . would you prefer to shake up the routine or to strive for an authoritative interpretation ? l do n't want to change things per se or to create something that has n't been done .
quite the opposite .
i want to do something that makes sense to me .
the only reason i rethink certain things is because they never made sense to me to begin with . maybe one of the reasons our beethoven is successful is that we do keep a lot of tradition in it .
it has to be organic and it has to have an inner logic . interview : rick fulker editor : elaine yeung / louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" thousands of internally displaced iraqi christians have moved there .
although viable on humanitarian grounds , the creation of a specific region for christians would be a short-term measure that does not offer a longer-term solution to the reconstruction of iraqi society and the reintegration of its communities .

among them was the integration of muslims in germany , a much-debated topic in recent weeks . talks between german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in berlin on saturday turned to the current debate in germany about immigrant integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the theme of muslim integration has been a hot topic lately both leaders pledged more to improve the integration of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish minority after the issue became a focus of public discussion .
following the meeting , merkel said germany should use the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between germany and turkey to take a look at the ongoing problems of integrating immigrant groups .
" we propose that everywhere in cities and towns where there are people of turkish origin , we use this event as a way of taking stock and seeing where we are and what has to be done , " merkel told reporters , adding that there were still problems to be addressed and that turkey was a willing and constructive partner .
" assimilation is not on our agenda , this is about integration , " merkel added , stressing that learning the german language was integral for the employment opportunities of young turks living in europe 's largest country .
wulff comments praised erdogan , meanwhile , said the integration of some 2 million turkish people living in germany was " very important , " and that both countries needed to take a closer look at what could be done to advance the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan stressed a need for a solid prospect of eu membership the turkish premier went on to welcome recent comments by german president christian wulff , who said on the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 that islam was " now a part of germany . "
the integration debate in germany has flared in recent months after a central banker said germany was becoming " more stupid , " claiming immigrants from muslim nations are poorly educated and unproductive .
talks also focused on bilateral ties , the situation in turkey following september 's constitutional referendum , security issues and ankara 's eu membership bid .
erdogan told a joint news conference with merkel that turkey 's bid to enter the eu must not be allowed to slow , addressing concerns that some eu members are stalling entry of a muslim country to the club .
the two leaders met over breakfast in berlin after the previous night 's euro 2012 football qualifying match in the city , where germany beat turkey 3-0 .
' no clear prospect ' for eu membership prior to his visit , erdogan accused the eu of failing to provide his country with a clear prospect of joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff was praised for his comments about islam the eu commission is finalizing its annual report on how turkey is progressing on eu requirements .
an impasse over cyprus , an eu member that turkey has refused to recognize , will be seen as the main outstanding problem .
a representative emnid survey conducted last week showed that 69 percent of germans oppose eu membership for turkey .
meanwhile , horst seehofer , the head of the conservative christian social union party and state premier of bavaria , has called for a restriction of immigration to germany from certain cultures .
seehofer told focus magazine that migrants from turkey and arab countries had a harder time integrating , and that those immigrants who refused to integrate must be dealt with more firmly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de disasters -pipe- 09.10.2010 hungarian town evacuated on fears of new toxic spill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kolontar has been evacuated on fears of a fresh spill authorities in hungary have evacuated a village close to the site of a toxic spill due to fears over a new toxic waste leak .
this comes as the country awaits a team of eu pollution cleanup experts . disaster management officials in hungary have moved to evacuate the village of kolontar over concerns it may be exposed to a second toxic waste leak from a nearby red sludge reservoir . tibor dobson , the regional chief of hungary 's disaster relief services , said the damaged section of the reservoir has further weakened and was at risk of complete collapse , threatening the village . " the evacuation of kolontar began at six in the morning -lsb- 4:00 a.m.
gmt -rsb- after we noticed a weakening in one of the reservoir 's dykes , " dobson said .
" the decision to evacuate was taken by interior minister sandor pinter , who took part in the meeting of the local defense committee early saturday . " dobson added that the neighboring village of devecser was also under consideration for evacuation . hungarian prime minister victor orban also said it was likely the alumina sludge reservoir 's weakened wall would fall . " last night the interior minister informed us that cracks have appeared on the northern wall of the reservoir , whose corner collapsed , which make it likely that the entire wall will collapse , " orban told reporters . seven people were killed and more than 150 others injured after the reservoir of a separate alumina plant burst its banks on monday sending around 700,000 cubic meters -lrb- 24,720,000 cubic feet -rrb- of sludge streaming through nearby villages and fields . the pollution wiped out all life in the marcal tributary river and there were fears it could spread down the danube river , europe 's second largest , and on to hungary 's southern neighbors .
those concerns have since eased , with hungarian authorities releasing fresh data on friday showing acidity levels - or ph - of around 8.2 in the danube , which could be considered " normal , " down from a level of around 9 when the sludge reached the river on thursday . environmental group greenpeace said in a statement on friday , however , that levels of arsenic and mercury detected in samples of the red sludge taken on tuesday were still twice that normally found in so-called red mud . eu answers call for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plaster was poured into the marcal to neutralize the toxic sludge the disaster prompted hungary on friday to ask the european commission to contribute at least three experts under the bloc 's joint civil protection assistance measures to aid authorities with cleanup efforts . according to a statement on the european union 's website , several eu countries were forthcoming with offers to send disaster management experts .
it said hungary was awaiting the arrival on saturday morning of a liaison officer from the monitoring and information center of the european commission who would be responsible for coordinating the experts once they were on the ground in the contaminated areas . despite the call for expertise , orban earlier had insisted that the eu member country does not need financial assistance in removing the red slurry containing poisonous heavy metals from villages , fields and rivers . orban conceded that , in some places , such as the hard-hit village of kolontar , there was little point in removing rubble left behind by the spill as habitation of the areas would no longer be possible . author : darren mara -lrb- afp / ap / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the event was the largest of its kind in bavaria for more than two decades . tens of thousands of people turned out on the streets of munich on saturday against the nuclear power policy of chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government .
a focus of the protest was the formation of a human chain , about 10 kilometers long , through the center of the city .
organizers said that some 50,000 people in all took part in the day 's events , while police put the number at around 25,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel claimed the protest showed the nuclear policy was deeply unpopular " it is an enormous success for us , " said marcus greineder , chief organizer of the bavaria chain reaction group , which organized the protest .
the heart of the demonstration was the city 's odeonsplatz , where a stage was set up to rally the crowd .
public ' simply does not accept ' social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader sigmar gabriel said that the turnout revealed the level of opposition to a planned extension to the operating lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" this shows once again that the population simply does n't accept government 's lobby group policy in favor of nuclear firms . "
five bavarian nuclear plants are affected by the extension , among them the particularly controversial isar 1 reactor which has been in use since 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isar 1 plant is perhaps the most controversial of bavaria 's nuclear sites several political parties and action groups rallied people to join the demonstration , calling for a move away from nuclear energy towards renewable energy .

a rally against plans to build a nuclear reprocessing plant in wackersdorf in 1985 - which was later abandoned - was attended by 30,000 to 50,000 people .
organizers say around 100,000 people took part in a demonstration against the planned extensions in berlin in september .
police put the number at 40,000 .
a previous german government of the spd and green party decided to close all nuclear plants by 2021 , but the current coalition has plans to extend that deadline by an average of 12 years .

this comes as the country awaits a team of eu pollution cleanup experts . disaster management officials in hungary have moved to evacuate the village of kolontar over concerns it may be exposed to a second toxic waste leak from a nearby red sludge reservoir . tibor dobson , the regional chief of hungary 's disaster relief services , said the damaged section of the reservoir has further weakened and was at risk of complete collapse , threatening the village . " the evacuation of kolontar began at six in the morning -lsb- 4:00 a.m.
gmt -rsb- after we noticed a weakening in one of the reservoir 's dykes , " dobson said .
" the decision to evacuate was taken by interior minister sandor pinter , who took part in the meeting of the local defense committee early saturday . " dobson added that the neighboring village of devecser was also under consideration for evacuation . hungarian prime minister victor orban also said it was likely the alumina sludge reservoir 's weakened wall would fall . " last night the interior minister informed us that cracks have appeared on the northern wall of the reservoir , whose corner collapsed , which make it likely that the entire wall will collapse , " orban told reporters . seven people were killed and more than 150 others injured after the reservoir of a separate alumina plant burst its banks on monday sending around 700,000 cubic meters -lrb- 24,720,000 cubic feet -rrb- of sludge streaming through nearby villages and fields . the pollution wiped out all life in the marcal tributary river and there were fears it could spread down the danube river , europe 's second largest , and on to hungary 's southern neighbors .
those concerns have since eased , with hungarian authorities releasing fresh data on friday showing acidity levels - or ph - of around 8.2 in the danube , which could be considered " normal , " down from a level of around 9 when the sludge reached the river on thursday . environmental group greenpeace said in a statement on friday , however , that levels of arsenic and mercury detected in samples of the red sludge taken on tuesday were still twice that normally found in so-called red mud . eu answers call for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plaster was poured into the marcal to neutralize the toxic sludge the disaster prompted hungary on friday to ask the european commission to contribute at least three experts under the bloc 's joint civil protection assistance measures to aid authorities with cleanup efforts . according to a statement on the european union 's website , several eu countries were forthcoming with offers to send disaster management experts .
it said hungary was awaiting the arrival on saturday morning of a liaison officer from the monitoring and information center of the european commission who would be responsible for coordinating the experts once they were on the ground in the contaminated areas . despite the call for expertise , orban earlier had insisted that the eu member country does not need financial assistance in removing the red slurry containing poisonous heavy metals from villages , fields and rivers . orban conceded that , in some places , such as the hard-hit village of kolontar , there was little point in removing rubble left behind by the spill as habitation of the areas would no longer be possible . author : darren mara -lrb- afp / ap / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as the country awaits a team of eu pollution cleanup experts . disaster management officials in hungary have moved to evacuate the village of kolontar over concerns it may be exposed to a second toxic waste leak from a nearby red sludge reservoir . tibor dobson , the regional chief of hungary 's disaster relief services , said the damaged section of the reservoir has further weakened and was at risk of complete collapse , threatening the village . " the evacuation of kolontar began at six in the morning -lsb- 4:00 a.m.
gmt -rsb- after we noticed a weakening in one of the reservoir 's dykes , " dobson said .
" the decision to evacuate was taken by interior minister sandor pinter , who took part in the meeting of the local defense committee early saturday . " dobson added that the neighboring village of devecser was also under consideration for evacuation . hungarian prime minister victor orban also said it was likely the alumina sludge reservoir 's weakened wall would fall . " last night the interior minister informed us that cracks have appeared on the northern wall of the reservoir , whose corner collapsed , which make it likely that the entire wall will collapse , " orban told reporters . seven people were killed and more than 150 others injured after the reservoir of a separate alumina plant burst its banks on monday sending around 700,000 cubic meters -lrb- 24,720,000 cubic feet -rrb- of sludge streaming through nearby villages and fields . the pollution wiped out all life in the marcal tributary river and there were fears it could spread down the danube river , europe 's second largest , and on to hungary 's southern neighbors .
those concerns have since eased , with hungarian authorities releasing fresh data on friday showing acidity levels - or ph - of around 8.2 in the danube , which could be considered " normal , " down from a level of around 9 when the sludge reached the river on thursday . environmental group greenpeace said in a statement on friday , however , that levels of arsenic and mercury detected in samples of the red sludge taken on tuesday were still twice that normally found in so-called red mud . eu answers call for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plaster was poured into the marcal to neutralize the toxic sludge the disaster prompted hungary on friday to ask the european commission to contribute at least three experts under the bloc 's joint civil protection assistance measures to aid authorities with cleanup efforts . according to a statement on the european union 's website , several eu countries were forthcoming with offers to send disaster management experts .
it said hungary was awaiting the arrival on saturday morning of a liaison officer from the monitoring and information center of the european commission who would be responsible for coordinating the experts once they were on the ground in the contaminated areas . despite the call for expertise , orban earlier had insisted that the eu member country does not need financial assistance in removing the red slurry containing poisonous heavy metals from villages , fields and rivers . orban conceded that , in some places , such as the hard-hit village of kolontar , there was little point in removing rubble left behind by the spill as habitation of the areas would no longer be possible . author : darren mara -lrb- afp / ap / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

among them was the integration of muslims in germany , a much-debated topic in recent weeks . talks between german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in berlin on saturday turned to the current debate in germany about immigrant integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the theme of muslim integration has been a hot topic lately both leaders pledged more to improve the integration of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish minority after the issue became a focus of public discussion .
following the meeting , merkel said germany should use the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between germany and turkey to take a look at the ongoing problems of integrating immigrant groups .
" we propose that everywhere in cities and towns where there are people of turkish origin , we use this event as a way of taking stock and seeing where we are and what has to be done , " merkel told reporters , adding that there were still problems to be addressed and that turkey was a willing and constructive partner .
" assimilation is not on our agenda , this is about integration , " merkel added , stressing that learning the german language was integral for the employment opportunities of young turks living in europe 's largest country .
wulff comments praised erdogan , meanwhile , said the integration of some 2 million turkish people living in germany was " very important , " and that both countries needed to take a closer look at what could be done to advance the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan stressed a need for a solid prospect of eu membership the turkish premier went on to welcome recent comments by german president christian wulff , who said on the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 that islam was " now a part of germany . "
the integration debate in germany has flared in recent months after a central banker said germany was becoming " more stupid , " claiming immigrants from muslim nations are poorly educated and unproductive .
talks also focused on bilateral ties , the situation in turkey following september 's constitutional referendum , security issues and ankara 's eu membership bid .
erdogan told a joint news conference with merkel that turkey 's bid to enter the eu must not be allowed to slow , addressing concerns that some eu members are stalling entry of a muslim country to the club .
the two leaders met over breakfast in berlin after the previous night 's euro 2012 football qualifying match in the city , where germany beat turkey 3-0 .
' no clear prospect ' for eu membership prior to his visit , erdogan accused the eu of failing to provide his country with a clear prospect of joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff was praised for his comments about islam the eu commission is finalizing its annual report on how turkey is progressing on eu requirements .
an impasse over cyprus , an eu member that turkey has refused to recognize , will be seen as the main outstanding problem .
a representative emnid survey conducted last week showed that 69 percent of germans oppose eu membership for turkey .
meanwhile , horst seehofer , the head of the conservative christian social union party and state premier of bavaria , has called for a restriction of immigration to germany from certain cultures .
seehofer told focus magazine that migrants from turkey and arab countries had a harder time integrating , and that those immigrants who refused to integrate must be dealt with more firmly .

his ensemble is orchestra-in-residence at this year 's beethovenfest bonn . conductor paavo jarvi has received numerous awards , including a grammy and an echo classic conductor of the year distinction in 2010 .
born in estonia , he moved to the united states , where he studied with leonard bernstein . he is currently music director of both the cincinnati symphony orchestra and the frankfurt radio symphony orchestra .
since 2004 , he 's been artistic director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie -lrb- german chamber philharmonic -rrb- of bremen , the beethovenfest 's orchestra-in-residence .
deutsche welle spoke with jarvi about the aims of the festival and the feeling behind the music performed there . deutsche welle : there is an ongoing relationship between the deutsche kammerphilharmonie and the beethovenfest , with the kammerphilharmonie being the orchestra-in-residence .
has this collaboration influenced the culture and development of this body of musicians ? paavo jarvi : an orchestra that functions on a self-governing basis as we do needs good friends and good partners .
and certainly the beethovenfest in bonn has been a fantastic partner .
it does help to have a festival that is well run , has a good infrastructure , and has - most importantly - a real guiding light .
i mean by that -lsb- beethovenfest director -rsb- ilona schmiel , who is an enormous source of energy .
her imagination and her interest in doing something new are really fantastic . we know that beethoven did n't have fond memories of bonn .
but is there something here , in the public and the atmosphere or in the expectations of the people , that strikes you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn is home to the annual beethovenfest the festival has established itself as a place that really makes beethoven its center .
and let 's face it : we 're performing in a relatively modern hall , and the city is obviously different from when beethoven was walking around here .
but that is not so important .
what is important is that the idea lives , the idea is strong , and -lsb- bonn -rsb- is the right place to create a festival around beethoven , because it is his birthplace .
and to me , the real souls of the festival are the ones who create it .
what beethoven thought about the city when he was here is almost irrelevant . this year 's beethovenfest also focuses on works by composer robert schumann .
what is there to discover about such a frequently performed composer ? it 's the type of gestures that schumann makes in his music - emotional , dramatic gestures that communicate to you with such directness and sincerity .
and there 's that impulsive , neurotic energy , the extremes of expression , the moments that can go to unbelievable euphoria and , a second later , -lsb- to -rsb- the deepest , darkest melancholy . to wear your heart on your sleeve in public , and go from one extreme to another and not be ashamed of it , is something that we have always been taught to be wrong .
we 're uncomfortable with that .
what we are trying to do with the kammerphilharmonie is to bring out just this aspect .
music by schumann needs to be exaggerated on every level .
exaggerated , not put into an acceptable , comfortable norm . against the backdrop of thousands of recordings , and many , many others who have preceded you , do you feel the need to shake up the routine ? one of the most difficult things i find , in general , is changing old habits .
people who have grown up with brahms and schumann and beethoven have heard , so many times , those pieces in a certain way .
they are simply so engrained that even if -lsb- these people -rsb- sometimes intellectually try to change something , when it comes to performance , they often fall back to those gestures that they heard when they were young .
you simply need to have enough time and repetition to create a new tradition and make it your own . that is something that is doable , especially if we do these beethoven and schumann " total immersion courses " - all symphonies in three days , or all schumann symphonies and overtures in two days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playing a cycle , like all beethoven symphonies , brings you amazingly close to the composer , says jarvi it 's amazing how close you can get to a composer if you really make an incredibly concentrated program of it and follow some principles and see how they work in other symphonies , overtures and so on .
it gradually becomes a language that you identify with , not just intellectually ; it becomes part of your genetics . would you prefer to shake up the routine or to strive for an authoritative interpretation ? l do n't want to change things per se or to create something that has n't been done .
quite the opposite .
i want to do something that makes sense to me .
the only reason i rethink certain things is because they never made sense to me to begin with . maybe one of the reasons our beethoven is successful is that we do keep a lot of tradition in it .
it has to be organic and it has to have an inner logic . interview : rick fulker editor : elaine yeung / louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iraqi christians are particularly fearful of the removal of the main barrier between them and their persecutors . their churches are burnt-out husks and heaps of rubble .
their businesses are targeted by extremists .
their leaders are kidnapped and assassinated .
the christian minority in iraq , once a community left in peace to prosper , continues to be under threat from a campaign of persecution which has forced as many as 500,000 christians to flee the country .
during the reign of saddam hussein , the estimated 1.4 million christians - many of them chaldean-assyrians and armenians , with small numbers of roman catholics - were generally left alone if they did n't oppose the government and they lived in relative peace with the country 's sunnis and shiites .
some , such as tariq aziz , saddam 's foreign minister and deputy prime minister , rose to the highest levels of power .
things changed after the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq toppled saddam 's regime .
christians became a target of violence when islamist groups and ordinary muslims angered by the military action began seeing them as the enemy , associating with them with the " crusaders " - the invading armies of the united states and britain .
tensions over their religious ties with the west and their differing beliefs to the strict islamic majority , which had been simmering for years , spilled over as the occupying forces dug in .
" iraqi christians became caught up in the overlapping violence and multiple conflicts unleashed after 2003 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , an iraq expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" they became exposed to the similar patterns of kidnappings , extortion , beheadings , rape and forced taxation that affected all other communities as the erosion of central government control left a security vacuum that was exploited by organised and opportunistic criminality and anti-occupation resistance groups . " " in addition to this , christians specifically were targeted by church bombings and assassination attempts owing to a perceived association with the aims and intentions of the occupying forces . " association with occupying powers makes christians targets in 2004 , insurgents launched a coordinated bombing campaign targeted churches in baghdad .
in 2007 , after pope benedict xvi made comments perceived to be anti-islam , nationwide attacks on churches hit an all-time high and a priest in the northern city of mosul was kidnapped and later found beheaded .
in january 2009 , 40 iraqi christians were killed and approximately 12,000 fled their homes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : churches have been targeted since the 2003 us-led invasion in february this year , at least 10 iraqi christians were killed by unknown gunmen in mosul as the country was preparing for the march 7 elections .
the escalating violence ahead of the ballot led to hundreds of iraqi christians taking to the streets in a number of protests , chanting slogans such as " stop the killing of christians . " during the years since the invasion , life for the christian minority has become beset by danger .
the waves of violent attacks against churches , businesses and homes have forced more than half of the christian population to flee for their lives , according to statistcs from the un high commission for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
those churches which remain standing are mostly empty , their congregations long gone or too afraid to attend . " the christian minority in iraq has been reduced to a shadow of its former self , " said ulrichsen .
" up to two-thirds of the pre-war community has been displaced or forced to flee the country .
although conditions in iraq have improved somewhat since 2007 , the security situation remains intensely fragile and prone to reversal , and the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes has been very slow and halting . " " there 's a real possibility that 2,000 years of settlement by christian communities in iraq is in danger of near-total extinction . " us withdrawal leave christians ' fate in iraqi hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congregations have dwindled through fear and exodus as the united states steps up its military withdrawal from iraq , the christian minority is forced to look at the iraqi security structure for protection .
however , the prospect of being protecetd by the iraqi police and armed forces fails to instill any confidence in the christian minority . " the greatest concern about a us pullout is that extremists will exploit any lapses in security and attack vulnerable groups , including christians , " samer muscati , an iraq expert from the middle east division at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . " although the iraqi government publicly condemns violence against christians and other minority groups , it has not taken measures to bolster security in areas where minorities are particularly vulnerable to attacks , and it has not thoroughly investigated attacks , " he added .
" iraqi security forces rarely apprehend , prosecute and punish perpetrators of such attacks , which has created a climate of impunity . " christians search for ways to protect themselves one muted proposal to protect the christian minority involves the creation of an autonomous province on a neglected area of land located to the north and west of mosul , called ninawah plain , which would act as a sanctuary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christians look for protection away from high-risk areas while advocates of the idea say it would n't stop the violence against christians in the large , high-risk cities of mosul , baghdad , and al-basrah , it would give the christians a place where their needs could be met , their beliefs supported and their security guaranteed . the proposals suggest that ninaweh plain would an autonomous administrative region in which the christian minority could govern themselves and would be free to participate in the federalist system which is developing in iraq . creation of autonomous region plagued by problems however , the idea of an autonomous region for the christian minority in reality looks unviable . " the image of a real autonomy is unrealistic , " nizar hanna , director of the assyrian democratic movement 's baghdad office , told deutsche welle .
" up to now , there are no concrete plans which show how this would work .
even in the kurdish constitution , they have the right to autonomy in the areas where they are the majority but nowhere is this the case .
besides , there are no areas in which only christians live .
shabak , yazidis , kurds and arabs also live there . " " to an extent a safe haven for christians exists in iraqi kurdistan , " kristian ulrichsen said .
" thousands of internally displaced iraqi christians have moved there .
although viable on humanitarian grounds , the creation of a specific region for christians would be a short-term measure that does not offer a longer-term solution to the reconstruction of iraqi society and the reintegration of its communities .

among them was the integration of muslims in germany , a much-debated topic in recent weeks . talks between german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in berlin on saturday turned to the current debate in germany about immigrant integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the theme of muslim integration has been a hot topic lately both leaders pledged more to improve the integration of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish minority after the issue became a focus of public discussion .
following the meeting , merkel said germany should use the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between germany and turkey to take a look at the ongoing problems of integrating immigrant groups .
" we propose that everywhere in cities and towns where there are people of turkish origin , we use this event as a way of taking stock and seeing where we are and what has to be done , " merkel told reporters , adding that there were still problems to be addressed and that turkey was a willing and constructive partner .
" assimilation is not on our agenda , this is about integration , " merkel added , stressing that learning the german language was integral for the employment opportunities of young turks living in europe 's largest country .
wulff comments praised erdogan , meanwhile , said the integration of some 2 million turkish people living in germany was " very important , " and that both countries needed to take a closer look at what could be done to advance the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan stressed a need for a solid prospect of eu membership the turkish premier went on to welcome recent comments by german president christian wulff , who said on the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 that islam was " now a part of germany . "
the integration debate in germany has flared in recent months after a central banker said germany was becoming " more stupid , " claiming immigrants from muslim nations are poorly educated and unproductive .
talks also focused on bilateral ties , the situation in turkey following september 's constitutional referendum , security issues and ankara 's eu membership bid .
erdogan told a joint news conference with merkel that turkey 's bid to enter the eu must not be allowed to slow , addressing concerns that some eu members are stalling entry of a muslim country to the club .
the two leaders met over breakfast in berlin after the previous night 's euro 2012 football qualifying match in the city , where germany beat turkey 3-0 .
' no clear prospect ' for eu membership prior to his visit , erdogan accused the eu of failing to provide his country with a clear prospect of joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff was praised for his comments about islam the eu commission is finalizing its annual report on how turkey is progressing on eu requirements .
an impasse over cyprus , an eu member that turkey has refused to recognize , will be seen as the main outstanding problem .
a representative emnid survey conducted last week showed that 69 percent of germans oppose eu membership for turkey .
meanwhile , horst seehofer , the head of the conservative christian social union party and state premier of bavaria , has called for a restriction of immigration to germany from certain cultures .
seehofer told focus magazine that migrants from turkey and arab countries had a harder time integrating , and that those immigrants who refused to integrate must be dealt with more firmly .

this comes as the country awaits a team of eu pollution cleanup experts . disaster management officials in hungary have moved to evacuate the village of kolontar over concerns it may be exposed to a second toxic waste leak from a nearby red sludge reservoir . tibor dobson , the regional chief of hungary 's disaster relief services , said the damaged section of the reservoir has further weakened and was at risk of complete collapse , threatening the village . " the evacuation of kolontar began at six in the morning -lsb- 4:00 a.m.
gmt -rsb- after we noticed a weakening in one of the reservoir 's dykes , " dobson said .
" the decision to evacuate was taken by interior minister sandor pinter , who took part in the meeting of the local defense committee early saturday . " dobson added that the neighboring village of devecser was also under consideration for evacuation . hungarian prime minister victor orban also said it was likely the alumina sludge reservoir 's weakened wall would fall . " last night the interior minister informed us that cracks have appeared on the northern wall of the reservoir , whose corner collapsed , which make it likely that the entire wall will collapse , " orban told reporters . seven people were killed and more than 150 others injured after the reservoir of a separate alumina plant burst its banks on monday sending around 700,000 cubic meters -lrb- 24,720,000 cubic feet -rrb- of sludge streaming through nearby villages and fields . the pollution wiped out all life in the marcal tributary river and there were fears it could spread down the danube river , europe 's second largest , and on to hungary 's southern neighbors .
those concerns have since eased , with hungarian authorities releasing fresh data on friday showing acidity levels - or ph - of around 8.2 in the danube , which could be considered " normal , " down from a level of around 9 when the sludge reached the river on thursday . environmental group greenpeace said in a statement on friday , however , that levels of arsenic and mercury detected in samples of the red sludge taken on tuesday were still twice that normally found in so-called red mud . eu answers call for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plaster was poured into the marcal to neutralize the toxic sludge the disaster prompted hungary on friday to ask the european commission to contribute at least three experts under the bloc 's joint civil protection assistance measures to aid authorities with cleanup efforts . according to a statement on the european union 's website , several eu countries were forthcoming with offers to send disaster management experts .
it said hungary was awaiting the arrival on saturday morning of a liaison officer from the monitoring and information center of the european commission who would be responsible for coordinating the experts once they were on the ground in the contaminated areas . despite the call for expertise , orban earlier had insisted that the eu member country does not need financial assistance in removing the red slurry containing poisonous heavy metals from villages , fields and rivers . orban conceded that , in some places , such as the hard-hit village of kolontar , there was little point in removing rubble left behind by the spill as habitation of the areas would no longer be possible . author : darren mara -lrb- afp / ap / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fears for the danube river have eased since the accident , with polution levels down . fears that the danube river , the second longest in europe , could become contaminated after a toxic sludge spill have eased after hungarian authorities claimed that pollution levels in the river have dropped since thursday .
tibor dobson , the regional chief of hungary 's disaster relief services , said fresh data showed acidity levels - or ph - of around 8.2 in the danube , which could be considered " normal , " down from a level of around 9 when the sludge reached the river on thursday .
" these data give us hope ... and we have not experienced any damage on the main danube so far , " dobson told news agency reuters .
further upstream at the confluence of the raba and the danube , which is closer to the site of the disaster , ph levels showed a reading of 9 and there were also still sporadic sightings of dead fish , officials said .
environmental group greenpeace said in a statement on friday that levels of arsenic and mercury detected in samples of the red sludge taken on tuesday were still twice that normally found in so-called red mud .
the death toll following monday 's toxic spill rose to seven late friday after a body was found in a sludge-covered area , while another man died in hospital of injuries sustained in the spill .
more than 150 others were injured after the reservoir burst its banks at a rural alumina plant sending around 700,000 cubic meters -lrb- 24,720,000 cubic feet -rrb- of sludge streaming through nearby villages .
the pollution already wiped out all life in the smaller marcal tributary and there were fears it could spread down the danube to hungary 's southern neighbors .
eu answers call for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the areas hit by the spill will be uninhabitable , officials say on friday , hungary asked the european commission to contribute at least three experts under the bloc 's joint civil protection assistance measures to aid authorities with the cleanup efforts .
according to a statement on the european union ’ s website , several eu countries were forthcoming with offers to send disaster management experts .
it said hungary was awaiting the arrival on saturday morning of a liaison officer from the monitoring and information center of the european commission who would be responsible for coordinating the experts once they were on the ground in the contaminated areas .
despite the call for expertise , prime minister viktor orban earlier had insisted that the eu member country does not need financial assistance in removing the red slurry containing poisonous heavy metals from villages , fields and rivers .
orban conceded that , in some places , such as the hard-hit village of kolontar , there was little point in removing rubble left behind by the spill as habitation of the areas would no longer be possible .

fears for the danube river have eased since the accident , with polution levels down . fears that the danube river , the second longest in europe , could become contaminated after a toxic sludge spill have eased after hungarian authorities claimed that pollution levels in the river have dropped since thursday .
tibor dobson , the regional chief of hungary 's disaster relief services , said fresh data showed acidity levels - or ph - of around 8.2 in the danube , which could be considered " normal , " down from a level of around 9 when the sludge reached the river on thursday .
" these data give us hope ... and we have not experienced any damage on the main danube so far , " dobson told news agency reuters .
further upstream at the confluence of the raba and the danube , which is closer to the site of the disaster , ph levels showed a reading of 9 and there were also still sporadic sightings of dead fish , officials said .
environmental group greenpeace said in a statement on friday that levels of arsenic and mercury detected in samples of the red sludge taken on tuesday were still twice that normally found in so-called red mud .
the death toll following monday 's toxic spill rose to seven late friday after a body was found in a sludge-covered area , while another man died in hospital of injuries sustained in the spill .
more than 150 others were injured after the reservoir burst its banks at a rural alumina plant sending around 700,000 cubic meters -lrb- 24,720,000 cubic feet -rrb- of sludge streaming through nearby villages .
the pollution already wiped out all life in the smaller marcal tributary and there were fears it could spread down the danube to hungary 's southern neighbors .
eu answers call for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the areas hit by the spill will be uninhabitable , officials say on friday , hungary asked the european commission to contribute at least three experts under the bloc 's joint civil protection assistance measures to aid authorities with the cleanup efforts .
according to a statement on the european union ’ s website , several eu countries were forthcoming with offers to send disaster management experts .
it said hungary was awaiting the arrival on saturday morning of a liaison officer from the monitoring and information center of the european commission who would be responsible for coordinating the experts once they were on the ground in the contaminated areas .
despite the call for expertise , prime minister viktor orban earlier had insisted that the eu member country does not need financial assistance in removing the red slurry containing poisonous heavy metals from villages , fields and rivers .
orban conceded that , in some places , such as the hard-hit village of kolontar , there was little point in removing rubble left behind by the spill as habitation of the areas would no longer be possible .

following the meeting , merkel said germany should use the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between germany and turkey to take a look at the ongoing problems of integrating immigrant groups .

fears for the danube river have eased since the accident , with polution levels down . fears that the danube river , the second longest in europe , could become contaminated after a toxic sludge spill have eased after hungarian authorities claimed that pollution levels in the river have dropped since thursday .
tibor dobson , the regional chief of hungary 's disaster relief services , said fresh data showed acidity levels - or ph - of around 8.2 in the danube , which could be considered " normal , " down from a level of around 9 when the sludge reached the river on thursday .
" these data give us hope ... and we have not experienced any damage on the main danube so far , " dobson told news agency reuters .
further upstream at the confluence of the raba and the danube , which is closer to the site of the disaster , ph levels showed a reading of 9 and there were also still sporadic sightings of dead fish , officials said .
environmental group greenpeace said in a statement on friday that levels of arsenic and mercury detected in samples of the red sludge taken on tuesday were still twice that normally found in so-called red mud .
the death toll following monday 's toxic spill rose to seven late friday after a body was found in a sludge-covered area , while another man died in hospital of injuries sustained in the spill .
more than 150 others were injured after the reservoir burst its banks at a rural alumina plant sending around 700,000 cubic meters -lrb- 24,720,000 cubic feet -rrb- of sludge streaming through nearby villages .
the pollution already wiped out all life in the smaller marcal tributary and there were fears it could spread down the danube to hungary 's southern neighbors .
eu answers call for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the areas hit by the spill will be uninhabitable , officials say on friday , hungary asked the european commission to contribute at least three experts under the bloc 's joint civil protection assistance measures to aid authorities with the cleanup efforts .
according to a statement on the european union ’ s website , several eu countries were forthcoming with offers to send disaster management experts .
it said hungary was awaiting the arrival on saturday morning of a liaison officer from the monitoring and information center of the european commission who would be responsible for coordinating the experts once they were on the ground in the contaminated areas .
despite the call for expertise , prime minister viktor orban earlier had insisted that the eu member country does not need financial assistance in removing the red slurry containing poisonous heavy metals from villages , fields and rivers .
orban conceded that , in some places , such as the hard-hit village of kolontar , there was little point in removing rubble left behind by the spill as habitation of the areas would no longer be possible .

but there are some people there who aren ’ t sure they even want the games . the tallest buildings in garmisch-partenkirchen near germany 's border with austria are churches , but they barely register on a landscape that is dominated by steep mountain foothills .
just outside of town , ski shops and hotels give way to farmland , bike trails , and horses grazing near a stream .
the town is germany 's most beloved ski resort , providing access to the country 's tallest mountain , the zugspitze .
it has an undeniable charm , but andreas keller , a 72-year-old retired professor , sees a looming threat to the small alpine resort town : the 2018 winter olympics .
" it 's a small alpine valley , " keller told deutsche welle .
" it 's not made for such a gigantic event . "
keller is part of a local volunteer campaign called nolympia , organized by members of the garmisch chapter of a bavarian environmental protection group .
nolympia is trying to keep garmisch-partenkirchen from being a junior partner in munich 's bid to host the 2018 winter olympics .
farmland in demand one of the biggest sticking points for nolympia is privately-owned farmland .
olympic organizers want to lease the land from the farmers and turn it into the athletes ' village .
andreas keller says the farmers are n't going to budge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas keller is worried the olympics will ruin garmisch " it 's not only the money .
it 's also the responsibility for the beauty of this valley , " he said .
" -lsb- the farmers -rsb- have a really good feeling that this must be kept and preserved . "
pointing at a map of garmisch that shows both developed areas of town and the undeveloped farmland , keller says as he 's watched his children and grandchildren grow up in garmisch , the green parts of the map keep getting smaller .
" garmisch is still a lovely town , but now a limit has been reached , " he said , adding that the city had decided to but a halt to the further development of farmland .
" now the rules should be broken for this one event ? "
the area should be preserved for future generations , keller says , not sacrificed for what he calls " a two week party for the international olympic committee . "
reinventing garmisch less than a mile from the farms andreas keller hopes to protect , black and white photos of local skiers from the past line the stone walls of the garmisch-partenkirchen city hall .
garmisch is no stranger to the olympics – it hosted the winter games in 1936 .
garmisch 's mayor , thomas schmid , hopes to see the games return in 2018 - and a boost in infrastructure development along with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch hosted the winter olympics in 1936 " a tourist resort like garmisch-partenkirchen has to invent itself more or less every 10 to 15 years anew , because we are in world-wide competition here , " he told deutsche welle .
" that 's why we need impulses and changes in infrastructure . "
a successful olympic bid would accelerate proposed infrastructure changes .
one example is a plan that would divert traffic between munich and the austrian city of innsbruck from the center of garmisch to a proposed mountain tunnel .
without the games , the mayor says this could take 30 years .
with the games , there would be a deadline of 2018 .
big winter sporting events are n't new to garmisch , either .
the town is set to host the 2011 alpine skiing world championships , and is involved in a german new year 's tradition , as host of one of the events of the four hills ski-jumping tournament .
" the new year 's jump on the first of january is the biggest sporting event , spectator-wise , that we have , " said schmid .
" the olympic events have even fewer spectators . "
the whistler role he admits that while any single day of the olympics may draw fewer spectators than the four hills tournament , there is a big difference in that the olympics go on for two weeks .
but with munich as the official host city , schmid thinks garmisch 's contribution would be much smaller , similar to whistler 's role during the vancouver olympics in canada .
" we wo n't have the hockey games where you have 20,000 people still waiting for the tickets -lsb- like they had in vancouver -rsb- , " schmid said .
" we 'll have it much calmer , much more traditional , and that 's why i 'm not afraid of organizing it here . "
even with resistance from nolympia and local farmers , schmid says garmisch 's olympic plans can be carried out even without the disputed farmland .
he says one percent of the available farm land in garmisch is under consideration , and they can simply build around any pieces of land that do n't get leased .
talking to the neighbors but people are starting to come around .
at a press conference in garmisch to announce a new sponsor of the munich bid application , the bid committee 's communications director jochen faerber says increased dialogue has led to more support for the games in garmisch .
" if you have a party in your apartment , you inform the neighbors before you do the party .
and i think maybe at the beginning , sometimes that was missed , " faerber told deutsche welle " i think that kind of communication has changed now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor schmid hopes the olympics will boost infrastructire projects resistance , however , is still there .
andreas keller and nolympia are collecting signatures for a local vote to decide once and for all if the people of garmisch want the olympics or not .
if garmisch is out , munich 's chances of getting the olympics nearly vanish as there is no other location to host the alpine skiing events .
a vote creeps into murky legal waters , though , as garmisch has already signed a number of contracts as a potential host site .
ultimately , the final word will come from the international olympic committee in july 2011 , when it will name either munich , the french town of annecy , or pyeongchang in south korea as the host of the 2018 winter olympics .

" the new year 's jump on the first of january is the biggest sporting event , spectator-wise , that we have , " said schmid .
" the olympic events have even fewer spectators . "
the whistler role he admits that while any single day of the olympics may draw fewer spectators than the four hills tournament , there is a big difference in that the olympics go on for two weeks .
but with munich as the official host city , schmid thinks garmisch 's contribution would be much smaller , similar to whistler 's role during the vancouver olympics in canada .
" we wo n't have the hockey games where you have 20,000 people still waiting for the tickets -lsb- like they had in vancouver -rsb- , " schmid said .
" we 'll have it much calmer , much more traditional , and that 's why i 'm not afraid of organizing it here . "
even with resistance from nolympia and local farmers , schmid says garmisch 's olympic plans can be carried out even without the disputed farmland .
he says one percent of the available farm land in garmisch is under consideration , and they can simply build around any pieces of land that do n't get leased .
talking to the neighbors but people are starting to come around .
at a press conference in garmisch to announce a new sponsor of the munich bid application , the bid committee 's communications director jochen faerber says increased dialogue has led to more support for the games in garmisch .
" if you have a party in your apartment , you inform the neighbors before you do the party .
and i think maybe at the beginning , sometimes that was missed , " faerber told deutsche welle " i think that kind of communication has changed now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor schmid hopes the olympics will boost infrastructire projects resistance , however , is still there .
andreas keller and nolympia are collecting signatures for a local vote to decide once and for all if the people of garmisch want the olympics or not .
if garmisch is out , munich 's chances of getting the olympics nearly vanish as there is no other location to host the alpine skiing events .
a vote creeps into murky legal waters , though , as garmisch has already signed a number of contracts as a potential host site .
ultimately , the final word will come from the international olympic committee in july 2011 , when it will name either munich , the french town of annecy , or pyeongchang in south korea as the host of the 2018 winter olympics .

but there are some people there who aren ’ t sure they even want the games . the tallest buildings in garmisch-partenkirchen near germany 's border with austria are churches , but they barely register on a landscape that is dominated by steep mountain foothills .
just outside of town , ski shops and hotels give way to farmland , bike trails , and horses grazing near a stream .
the town is germany 's most beloved ski resort , providing access to the country 's tallest mountain , the zugspitze .
it has an undeniable charm , but andreas keller , a 72-year-old retired professor , sees a looming threat to the small alpine resort town : the 2018 winter olympics .
" it 's a small alpine valley , " keller told deutsche welle .
" it 's not made for such a gigantic event . "
keller is part of a local volunteer campaign called nolympia , organized by members of the garmisch chapter of a bavarian environmental protection group .
nolympia is trying to keep garmisch-partenkirchen from being a junior partner in munich 's bid to host the 2018 winter olympics .
farmland in demand one of the biggest sticking points for nolympia is privately-owned farmland .
olympic organizers want to lease the land from the farmers and turn it into the athletes ' village .
andreas keller says the farmers are n't going to budge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas keller is worried the olympics will ruin garmisch " it 's not only the money .
it 's also the responsibility for the beauty of this valley , " he said .
" -lsb- the farmers -rsb- have a really good feeling that this must be kept and preserved . "
pointing at a map of garmisch that shows both developed areas of town and the undeveloped farmland , keller says as he 's watched his children and grandchildren grow up in garmisch , the green parts of the map keep getting smaller .
" garmisch is still a lovely town , but now a limit has been reached , " he said , adding that the city had decided to but a halt to the further development of farmland .
" now the rules should be broken for this one event ? "
the area should be preserved for future generations , keller says , not sacrificed for what he calls " a two week party for the international olympic committee . "

garmisch is no stranger to the olympics – it hosted the winter games in 1936 .
garmisch 's mayor , thomas schmid , hopes to see the games return in 2018 - and a boost in infrastructure development along with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch hosted the winter olympics in 1936 " a tourist resort like garmisch-partenkirchen has to invent itself more or less every 10 to 15 years anew , because we are in world-wide competition here , " he told deutsche welle .
" that 's why we need impulses and changes in infrastructure . "
a successful olympic bid would accelerate proposed infrastructure changes .
one example is a plan that would divert traffic between munich and the austrian city of innsbruck from the center of garmisch to a proposed mountain tunnel .
without the games , the mayor says this could take 30 years .

iraqi christians are particularly fearful of the removal of the main barrier between them and their persecutors . their churches are burnt-out husks and heaps of rubble .
their businesses are targeted by extremists .
their leaders are kidnapped and assassinated .
the christian minority in iraq , once a community left in peace to prosper , continues to be under threat from a campaign of persecution which has forced as many as 500,000 christians to flee the country .
during the reign of saddam hussein , the estimated 1.4 million christians - many of them chaldean-assyrians and armenians , with small numbers of roman catholics - were generally left alone if they did n't oppose the government and they lived in relative peace with the country 's sunnis and shiites .
some , such as tariq aziz , saddam 's foreign minister and deputy prime minister , rose to the highest levels of power .
things changed after the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq toppled saddam 's regime .
christians became a target of violence when islamist groups and ordinary muslims angered by the military action began seeing them as the enemy , associating with them with the " crusaders " - the invading armies of the united states and britain .
tensions over their religious ties with the west and their differing beliefs to the strict islamic majority , which had been simmering for years , spilled over as the occupying forces dug in .
" iraqi christians became caught up in the overlapping violence and multiple conflicts unleashed after 2003 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , an iraq expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" they became exposed to the similar patterns of kidnappings , extortion , beheadings , rape and forced taxation that affected all other communities as the erosion of central government control left a security vacuum that was exploited by organised and opportunistic criminality and anti-occupation resistance groups . " " in addition to this , christians specifically were targeted by church bombings and assassination attempts owing to a perceived association with the aims and intentions of the occupying forces . " association with occupying powers makes christians targets in 2004 , insurgents launched a coordinated bombing campaign targeted churches in baghdad .
in 2007 , after pope benedict xvi made comments perceived to be anti-islam , nationwide attacks on churches hit an all-time high and a priest in the northern city of mosul was kidnapped and later found beheaded .
in january 2009 , 40 iraqi christians were killed and approximately 12,000 fled their homes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : churches have been targeted since the 2003 us-led invasion in february this year , at least 10 iraqi christians were killed by unknown gunmen in mosul as the country was preparing for the march 7 elections .
the escalating violence ahead of the ballot led to hundreds of iraqi christians taking to the streets in a number of protests , chanting slogans such as " stop the killing of christians . " during the years since the invasion , life for the christian minority has become beset by danger .
the waves of violent attacks against churches , businesses and homes have forced more than half of the christian population to flee for their lives , according to statistcs from the un high commission for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
those churches which remain standing are mostly empty , their congregations long gone or too afraid to attend . " the christian minority in iraq has been reduced to a shadow of its former self , " said ulrichsen .
" up to two-thirds of the pre-war community has been displaced or forced to flee the country .
although conditions in iraq have improved somewhat since 2007 , the security situation remains intensely fragile and prone to reversal , and the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes has been very slow and halting . " " there 's a real possibility that 2,000 years of settlement by christian communities in iraq is in danger of near-total extinction . " us withdrawal leave christians ' fate in iraqi hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congregations have dwindled through fear and exodus as the united states steps up its military withdrawal from iraq , the christian minority is forced to look at the iraqi security structure for protection .
however , the prospect of being protecetd by the iraqi police and armed forces fails to instill any confidence in the christian minority . " the greatest concern about a us pullout is that extremists will exploit any lapses in security and attack vulnerable groups , including christians , " samer muscati , an iraq expert from the middle east division at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . " although the iraqi government publicly condemns violence against christians and other minority groups , it has not taken measures to bolster security in areas where minorities are particularly vulnerable to attacks , and it has not thoroughly investigated attacks , " he added .
" iraqi security forces rarely apprehend , prosecute and punish perpetrators of such attacks , which has created a climate of impunity . " christians search for ways to protect themselves one muted proposal to protect the christian minority involves the creation of an autonomous province on a neglected area of land located to the north and west of mosul , called ninawah plain , which would act as a sanctuary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christians look for protection away from high-risk areas while advocates of the idea say it would n't stop the violence against christians in the large , high-risk cities of mosul , baghdad , and al-basrah , it would give the christians a place where their needs could be met , their beliefs supported and their security guaranteed . the proposals suggest that ninaweh plain would an autonomous administrative region in which the christian minority could govern themselves and would be free to participate in the federalist system which is developing in iraq . creation of autonomous region plagued by problems however , the idea of an autonomous region for the christian minority in reality looks unviable . " the image of a real autonomy is unrealistic , " nizar hanna , director of the assyrian democratic movement 's baghdad office , told deutsche welle .
" up to now , there are no concrete plans which show how this would work .
even in the kurdish constitution , they have the right to autonomy in the areas where they are the majority but nowhere is this the case .
besides , there are no areas in which only christians live .
shabak , yazidis , kurds and arabs also live there . " " to an extent a safe haven for christians exists in iraqi kurdistan , " kristian ulrichsen said .
" thousands of internally displaced iraqi christians have moved there .
although viable on humanitarian grounds , the creation of a specific region for christians would be a short-term measure that does not offer a longer-term solution to the reconstruction of iraqi society and the reintegration of its communities .

his ensemble is orchestra-in-residence at this year 's beethovenfest bonn . conductor paavo jarvi has received numerous awards , including a grammy and an echo classic conductor of the year distinction in 2010 .
born in estonia , he moved to the united states , where he studied with leonard bernstein . he is currently music director of both the cincinnati symphony orchestra and the frankfurt radio symphony orchestra .
since 2004 , he 's been artistic director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie -lrb- german chamber philharmonic -rrb- of bremen , the beethovenfest 's orchestra-in-residence .
deutsche welle spoke with jarvi about the aims of the festival and the feeling behind the music performed there . deutsche welle : there is an ongoing relationship between the deutsche kammerphilharmonie and the beethovenfest , with the kammerphilharmonie being the orchestra-in-residence .
has this collaboration influenced the culture and development of this body of musicians ? paavo jarvi : an orchestra that functions on a self-governing basis as we do needs good friends and good partners .
and certainly the beethovenfest in bonn has been a fantastic partner .
it does help to have a festival that is well run , has a good infrastructure , and has - most importantly - a real guiding light .
i mean by that -lsb- beethovenfest director -rsb- ilona schmiel , who is an enormous source of energy .
her imagination and her interest in doing something new are really fantastic . we know that beethoven did n't have fond memories of bonn .
but is there something here , in the public and the atmosphere or in the expectations of the people , that strikes you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn is home to the annual beethovenfest the festival has established itself as a place that really makes beethoven its center .
and let 's face it : we 're performing in a relatively modern hall , and the city is obviously different from when beethoven was walking around here .
but that is not so important .
what is important is that the idea lives , the idea is strong , and -lsb- bonn -rsb- is the right place to create a festival around beethoven , because it is his birthplace .
and to me , the real souls of the festival are the ones who create it .
what beethoven thought about the city when he was here is almost irrelevant . this year 's beethovenfest also focuses on works by composer robert schumann .
what is there to discover about such a frequently performed composer ? it 's the type of gestures that schumann makes in his music - emotional , dramatic gestures that communicate to you with such directness and sincerity .
and there 's that impulsive , neurotic energy , the extremes of expression , the moments that can go to unbelievable euphoria and , a second later , -lsb- to -rsb- the deepest , darkest melancholy . to wear your heart on your sleeve in public , and go from one extreme to another and not be ashamed of it , is something that we have always been taught to be wrong .
we 're uncomfortable with that .
what we are trying to do with the kammerphilharmonie is to bring out just this aspect .
music by schumann needs to be exaggerated on every level .
exaggerated , not put into an acceptable , comfortable norm . against the backdrop of thousands of recordings , and many , many others who have preceded you , do you feel the need to shake up the routine ? one of the most difficult things i find , in general , is changing old habits .
people who have grown up with brahms and schumann and beethoven have heard , so many times , those pieces in a certain way .
they are simply so engrained that even if -lsb- these people -rsb- sometimes intellectually try to change something , when it comes to performance , they often fall back to those gestures that they heard when they were young .
you simply need to have enough time and repetition to create a new tradition and make it your own . that is something that is doable , especially if we do these beethoven and schumann " total immersion courses " - all symphonies in three days , or all schumann symphonies and overtures in two days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playing a cycle , like all beethoven symphonies , brings you amazingly close to the composer , says jarvi it 's amazing how close you can get to a composer if you really make an incredibly concentrated program of it and follow some principles and see how they work in other symphonies , overtures and so on .
it gradually becomes a language that you identify with , not just intellectually ; it becomes part of your genetics . would you prefer to shake up the routine or to strive for an authoritative interpretation ? l do n't want to change things per se or to create something that has n't been done .
quite the opposite .
i want to do something that makes sense to me .
the only reason i rethink certain things is because they never made sense to me to begin with . maybe one of the reasons our beethoven is successful is that we do keep a lot of tradition in it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iraq -pipe- 09.10.2010 iraqi christians fear escalating persecution as us forces withdraw großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protection of christians may not be a priority in iraq as us forces continue to withdraw from iraq , many fear a return to sectarian violence once they 've gone .
iraqi christians are particularly fearful of the removal of the main barrier between them and their persecutors . their churches are burnt-out husks and heaps of rubble .
their businesses are targeted by extremists .
their leaders are kidnapped and assassinated .
the christian minority in iraq , once a community left in peace to prosper , continues to be under threat from a campaign of persecution which has forced as many as 500,000 christians to flee the country .
during the reign of saddam hussein , the estimated 1.4 million christians - many of them chaldean-assyrians and armenians , with small numbers of roman catholics - were generally left alone if they did n't oppose the government and they lived in relative peace with the country 's sunnis and shiites .
some , such as tariq aziz , saddam 's foreign minister and deputy prime minister , rose to the highest levels of power .
things changed after the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq toppled saddam 's regime .
christians became a target of violence when islamist groups and ordinary muslims angered by the military action began seeing them as the enemy , associating with them with the " crusaders " - the invading armies of the united states and britain .
tensions over their religious ties with the west and their differing beliefs to the strict islamic majority , which had been simmering for years , spilled over as the occupying forces dug in .
" iraqi christians became caught up in the overlapping violence and multiple conflicts unleashed after 2003 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , an iraq expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" they became exposed to the similar patterns of kidnappings , extortion , beheadings , rape and forced taxation that affected all other communities as the erosion of central government control left a security vacuum that was exploited by organised and opportunistic criminality and anti-occupation resistance groups . " " in addition to this , christians specifically were targeted by church bombings and assassination attempts owing to a perceived association with the aims and intentions of the occupying forces . " association with occupying powers makes christians targets in 2004 , insurgents launched a coordinated bombing campaign targeted churches in baghdad .
in 2007 , after pope benedict xvi made comments perceived to be anti-islam , nationwide attacks on churches hit an all-time high and a priest in the northern city of mosul was kidnapped and later found beheaded .
in january 2009 , 40 iraqi christians were killed and approximately 12,000 fled their homes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : churches have been targeted since the 2003 us-led invasion in february this year , at least 10 iraqi christians were killed by unknown gunmen in mosul as the country was preparing for the march 7 elections .
the escalating violence ahead of the ballot led to hundreds of iraqi christians taking to the streets in a number of protests , chanting slogans such as " stop the killing of christians . " during the years since the invasion , life for the christian minority has become beset by danger .
the waves of violent attacks against churches , businesses and homes have forced more than half of the christian population to flee for their lives , according to statistcs from the un high commission for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
those churches which remain standing are mostly empty , their congregations long gone or too afraid to attend . " the christian minority in iraq has been reduced to a shadow of its former self , " said ulrichsen .
" up to two-thirds of the pre-war community has been displaced or forced to flee the country .
although conditions in iraq have improved somewhat since 2007 , the security situation remains intensely fragile and prone to reversal , and the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes has been very slow and halting . " " there 's a real possibility that 2,000 years of settlement by christian communities in iraq is in danger of near-total extinction . " us withdrawal leave christians ' fate in iraqi hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congregations have dwindled through fear and exodus as the united states steps up its military withdrawal from iraq , the christian minority is forced to look at the iraqi security structure for protection .
however , the prospect of being protecetd by the iraqi police and armed forces fails to instill any confidence in the christian minority . " the greatest concern about a us pullout is that extremists will exploit any lapses in security and attack vulnerable groups , including christians , " samer muscati , an iraq expert from the middle east division at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . " although the iraqi government publicly condemns violence against christians and other minority groups , it has not taken measures to bolster security in areas where minorities are particularly vulnerable to attacks , and it has not thoroughly investigated attacks , " he added .
" iraqi security forces rarely apprehend , prosecute and punish perpetrators of such attacks , which has created a climate of impunity . " christians search for ways to protect themselves one muted proposal to protect the christian minority involves the creation of an autonomous province on a neglected area of land located to the north and west of mosul , called ninawah plain , which would act as a sanctuary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christians look for protection away from high-risk areas while advocates of the idea say it would n't stop the violence against christians in the large , high-risk cities of mosul , baghdad , and al-basrah , it would give the christians a place where their needs could be met , their beliefs supported and their security guaranteed . the proposals suggest that ninaweh plain would an autonomous administrative region in which the christian minority could govern themselves and would be free to participate in the federalist system which is developing in iraq . creation of autonomous region plagued by problems however , the idea of an autonomous region for the christian minority in reality looks unviable . " the image of a real autonomy is unrealistic , " nizar hanna , director of the assyrian democratic movement 's baghdad office , told deutsche welle .
" up to now , there are no concrete plans which show how this would work .
even in the kurdish constitution , they have the right to autonomy in the areas where they are the majority but nowhere is this the case .
besides , there are no areas in which only christians live .
shabak , yazidis , kurds and arabs also live there . " " to an extent a safe haven for christians exists in iraqi kurdistan , " kristian ulrichsen said .
" thousands of internally displaced iraqi christians have moved there .
although viable on humanitarian grounds , the creation of a specific region for christians would be a short-term measure that does not offer a longer-term solution to the reconstruction of iraqi society and the reintegration of its communities .

the event was the largest of its kind in bavaria for more than two decades . tens of thousands of people turned out on the streets of munich on saturday against the nuclear power policy of chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government .
a focus of the protest was the formation of a human chain , about 10 kilometers long , through the center of the city .
organizers said that some 50,000 people in all took part in the day 's events , while police put the number at around 25,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel claimed the protest showed the nuclear policy was deeply unpopular " it is an enormous success for us , " said marcus greineder , chief organizer of the bavaria chain reaction group , which organized the protest .
the heart of the demonstration was the city 's odeonsplatz , where a stage was set up to rally the crowd .
public ' simply does not accept ' social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader sigmar gabriel said that the turnout revealed the level of opposition to a planned extension to the operating lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" this shows once again that the population simply does n't accept government 's lobby group policy in favor of nuclear firms . "
five bavarian nuclear plants are affected by the extension , among them the particularly controversial isar 1 reactor which has been in use since 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isar 1 plant is perhaps the most controversial of bavaria 's nuclear sites several political parties and action groups rallied people to join the demonstration , calling for a move away from nuclear energy towards renewable energy .
reprocessing idea abandoned the action was the biggest anti-nuclear event in bavaria in decades .
a rally against plans to build a nuclear reprocessing plant in wackersdorf in 1985 - which was later abandoned - was attended by 30,000 to 50,000 people .
organizers say around 100,000 people took part in a demonstration against the planned extensions in berlin in september .
police put the number at 40,000 .
a previous german government of the spd and green party decided to close all nuclear plants by 2021 , but the current coalition has plans to extend that deadline by an average of 12 years .

among them was the integration of muslims in germany , a much-debated topic in recent weeks . talks between german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in berlin on saturday turned to the current debate in germany about immigrant integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the theme of muslim integration has been a hot topic lately both leaders pledged more to improve the integration of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish minority after the issue became a focus of public discussion .
following the meeting , merkel said germany should use the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between germany and turkey to take a look at the ongoing problems of integrating immigrant groups .
" we propose that everywhere in cities and towns where there are people of turkish origin , we use this event as a way of taking stock and seeing where we are and what has to be done , " merkel told reporters , adding that there were still problems to be addressed and that turkey was a willing and constructive partner .
" assimilation is not on our agenda , this is about integration , " merkel added , stressing that learning the german language was integral for the employment opportunities of young turks living in europe 's largest country .
wulff comments praised erdogan , meanwhile , said the integration of some 2 million turkish people living in germany was " very important , " and that both countries needed to take a closer look at what could be done to advance the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan stressed a need for a solid prospect of eu membership the turkish premier went on to welcome recent comments by german president christian wulff , who said on the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 that islam was " now a part of germany . "
the integration debate in germany has flared in recent months after a central banker said germany was becoming " more stupid , " claiming immigrants from muslim nations are poorly educated and unproductive .
talks also focused on bilateral ties , the situation in turkey following september 's constitutional referendum , security issues and ankara 's eu membership bid .
erdogan told a joint news conference with merkel that turkey 's bid to enter the eu must not be allowed to slow , addressing concerns that some eu members are stalling entry of a muslim country to the club .
the two leaders met over breakfast in berlin after the previous night 's euro 2012 football qualifying match in the city , where germany beat turkey 3-0 .
' no clear prospect ' for eu membership prior to his visit , erdogan accused the eu of failing to provide his country with a clear prospect of joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff was praised for his comments about islam the eu commission is finalizing its annual report on how turkey is progressing on eu requirements .
an impasse over cyprus , an eu member that turkey has refused to recognize , will be seen as the main outstanding problem .
a representative emnid survey conducted last week showed that 69 percent of germans oppose eu membership for turkey .
meanwhile , horst seehofer , the head of the conservative christian social union party and state premier of bavaria , has called for a restriction of immigration to germany from certain cultures .
seehofer told focus magazine that migrants from turkey and arab countries had a harder time integrating , and that those immigrants who refused to integrate must be dealt with more firmly .

the event was the largest of its kind in bavaria for more than two decades . tens of thousands of people turned out on the streets of munich on saturday against the nuclear power policy of chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government .
a focus of the protest was the formation of a human chain , about 10 kilometers long , through the center of the city .
organizers said that some 50,000 people in all took part in the day 's events , while police put the number at around 25,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel claimed the protest showed the nuclear policy was deeply unpopular " it is an enormous success for us , " said marcus greineder , chief organizer of the bavaria chain reaction group , which organized the protest .
the heart of the demonstration was the city 's odeonsplatz , where a stage was set up to rally the crowd .
public ' simply does not accept ' social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader sigmar gabriel said that the turnout revealed the level of opposition to a planned extension to the operating lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" this shows once again that the population simply does n't accept government 's lobby group policy in favor of nuclear firms . "
five bavarian nuclear plants are affected by the extension , among them the particularly controversial isar 1 reactor which has been in use since 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isar 1 plant is perhaps the most controversial of bavaria 's nuclear sites several political parties and action groups rallied people to join the demonstration , calling for a move away from nuclear energy towards renewable energy .

a rally against plans to build a nuclear reprocessing plant in wackersdorf in 1985 - which was later abandoned - was attended by 30,000 to 50,000 people .
organizers say around 100,000 people took part in a demonstration against the planned extensions in berlin in september .
police put the number at 40,000 .
a previous german government of the spd and green party decided to close all nuclear plants by 2021 , but the current coalition has plans to extend that deadline by an average of 12 years .

this comes as the country awaits a team of eu pollution cleanup experts . disaster management officials in hungary have moved to evacuate the village of kolontar over concerns it may be exposed to a second toxic waste leak from a nearby red sludge reservoir . tibor dobson , the regional chief of hungary 's disaster relief services , said the damaged section of the reservoir has further weakened and was at risk of complete collapse , threatening the village . " the evacuation of kolontar began at six in the morning -lsb- 4:00 a.m.
gmt -rsb- after we noticed a weakening in one of the reservoir 's dykes , " dobson said .
" the decision to evacuate was taken by interior minister sandor pinter , who took part in the meeting of the local defense committee early saturday . " dobson added that the neighboring village of devecser was also under consideration for evacuation . hungarian prime minister victor orban also said it was likely the alumina sludge reservoir 's weakened wall would fall . " last night the interior minister informed us that cracks have appeared on the northern wall of the reservoir , whose corner collapsed , which make it likely that the entire wall will collapse , " orban told reporters . seven people were killed and more than 150 others injured after the reservoir of a separate alumina plant burst its banks on monday sending around 700,000 cubic meters -lrb- 24,720,000 cubic feet -rrb- of sludge streaming through nearby villages and fields . the pollution wiped out all life in the marcal tributary river and there were fears it could spread down the danube river , europe 's second largest , and on to hungary 's southern neighbors .
those concerns have since eased , with hungarian authorities releasing fresh data on friday showing acidity levels - or ph - of around 8.2 in the danube , which could be considered " normal , " down from a level of around 9 when the sludge reached the river on thursday . environmental group greenpeace said in a statement on friday , however , that levels of arsenic and mercury detected in samples of the red sludge taken on tuesday were still twice that normally found in so-called red mud . eu answers call for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : plaster was poured into the marcal to neutralize the toxic sludge the disaster prompted hungary on friday to ask the european commission to contribute at least three experts under the bloc 's joint civil protection assistance measures to aid authorities with cleanup efforts . according to a statement on the european union 's website , several eu countries were forthcoming with offers to send disaster management experts .
it said hungary was awaiting the arrival on saturday morning of a liaison officer from the monitoring and information center of the european commission who would be responsible for coordinating the experts once they were on the ground in the contaminated areas . despite the call for expertise , orban earlier had insisted that the eu member country does not need financial assistance in removing the red slurry containing poisonous heavy metals from villages , fields and rivers . orban conceded that , in some places , such as the hard-hit village of kolontar , there was little point in removing rubble left behind by the spill as habitation of the areas would no longer be possible . author : darren mara -lrb- afp / ap / dpa -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fears for the danube river have eased since the accident , with polution levels down . fears that the danube river , the second longest in europe , could become contaminated after a toxic sludge spill have eased after hungarian authorities claimed that pollution levels in the river have dropped since thursday .
tibor dobson , the regional chief of hungary 's disaster relief services , said fresh data showed acidity levels - or ph - of around 8.2 in the danube , which could be considered " normal , " down from a level of around 9 when the sludge reached the river on thursday .
" these data give us hope ... and we have not experienced any damage on the main danube so far , " dobson told news agency reuters .
further upstream at the confluence of the raba and the danube , which is closer to the site of the disaster , ph levels showed a reading of 9 and there were also still sporadic sightings of dead fish , officials said .
environmental group greenpeace said in a statement on friday that levels of arsenic and mercury detected in samples of the red sludge taken on tuesday were still twice that normally found in so-called red mud .
the death toll following monday 's toxic spill rose to seven late friday after a body was found in a sludge-covered area , while another man died in hospital of injuries sustained in the spill .
more than 150 others were injured after the reservoir burst its banks at a rural alumina plant sending around 700,000 cubic meters -lrb- 24,720,000 cubic feet -rrb- of sludge streaming through nearby villages .

it said hungary was awaiting the arrival on saturday morning of a liaison officer from the monitoring and information center of the european commission who would be responsible for coordinating the experts once they were on the ground in the contaminated areas .
despite the call for expertise , prime minister viktor orban earlier had insisted that the eu member country does not need financial assistance in removing the red slurry containing poisonous heavy metals from villages , fields and rivers .
orban conceded that , in some places , such as the hard-hit village of kolontar , there was little point in removing rubble left behind by the spill as habitation of the areas would no longer be possible .

tibor dobson , the regional chief of hungary 's disaster relief services , said fresh data showed acidity levels - or ph - of around 8.2 in the danube , which could be considered " normal , " down from a level of around 9 when the sludge reached the river on thursday .
" these data give us hope ... and we have not experienced any damage on the main danube so far , " dobson told news agency reuters .
further upstream at the confluence of the raba and the danube , which is closer to the site of the disaster , ph levels showed a reading of 9 and there were also still sporadic sightings of dead fish , officials said .
environmental group greenpeace said in a statement on friday that levels of arsenic and mercury detected in samples of the red sludge taken on tuesday were still twice that normally found in so-called red mud .
the death toll following monday 's toxic spill rose to seven late friday after a body was found in a sludge-covered area , while another man died in hospital of injuries sustained in the spill .
more than 150 others were injured after the reservoir burst its banks at a rural alumina plant sending around 700,000 cubic meters -lrb- 24,720,000 cubic feet -rrb- of sludge streaming through nearby villages .
the pollution already wiped out all life in the smaller marcal tributary and there were fears it could spread down the danube to hungary 's southern neighbors .
eu answers call for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the areas hit by the spill will be uninhabitable , officials say on friday , hungary asked the european commission to contribute at least three experts under the bloc 's joint civil protection assistance measures to aid authorities with the cleanup efforts .
according to a statement on the european union ’ s website , several eu countries were forthcoming with offers to send disaster management experts .
it said hungary was awaiting the arrival on saturday morning of a liaison officer from the monitoring and information center of the european commission who would be responsible for coordinating the experts once they were on the ground in the contaminated areas .
despite the call for expertise , prime minister viktor orban earlier had insisted that the eu member country does not need financial assistance in removing the red slurry containing poisonous heavy metals from villages , fields and rivers .
orban conceded that , in some places , such as the hard-hit village of kolontar , there was little point in removing rubble left behind by the spill as habitation of the areas would no longer be possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de winter sports -pipe- 09.10.2010 munich 's 2018 olympic bid hinges on alpine town of garmisch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this meadow is a proposed site for the athletes ' village if munich wins the bid to host the 2018 winter olympics , about half of the events will take place in the alpine town of garmisch-partenkirchen .
but there are some people there who aren ’ t sure they even want the games . the tallest buildings in garmisch-partenkirchen near germany 's border with austria are churches , but they barely register on a landscape that is dominated by steep mountain foothills .
just outside of town , ski shops and hotels give way to farmland , bike trails , and horses grazing near a stream .
the town is germany 's most beloved ski resort , providing access to the country 's tallest mountain , the zugspitze .
it has an undeniable charm , but andreas keller , a 72-year-old retired professor , sees a looming threat to the small alpine resort town : the 2018 winter olympics .
" it 's a small alpine valley , " keller told deutsche welle .
" it 's not made for such a gigantic event . "
keller is part of a local volunteer campaign called nolympia , organized by members of the garmisch chapter of a bavarian environmental protection group .
nolympia is trying to keep garmisch-partenkirchen from being a junior partner in munich 's bid to host the 2018 winter olympics .
farmland in demand one of the biggest sticking points for nolympia is privately-owned farmland .
olympic organizers want to lease the land from the farmers and turn it into the athletes ' village .
andreas keller says the farmers are n't going to budge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas keller is worried the olympics will ruin garmisch " it 's not only the money .
it 's also the responsibility for the beauty of this valley , " he said .
" -lsb- the farmers -rsb- have a really good feeling that this must be kept and preserved . "
pointing at a map of garmisch that shows both developed areas of town and the undeveloped farmland , keller says as he 's watched his children and grandchildren grow up in garmisch , the green parts of the map keep getting smaller .
" garmisch is still a lovely town , but now a limit has been reached , " he said , adding that the city had decided to but a halt to the further development of farmland .
" now the rules should be broken for this one event ? "
the area should be preserved for future generations , keller says , not sacrificed for what he calls " a two week party for the international olympic committee . "
reinventing garmisch less than a mile from the farms andreas keller hopes to protect , black and white photos of local skiers from the past line the stone walls of the garmisch-partenkirchen city hall .
garmisch is no stranger to the olympics – it hosted the winter games in 1936 .
garmisch 's mayor , thomas schmid , hopes to see the games return in 2018 - and a boost in infrastructure development along with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch hosted the winter olympics in 1936 " a tourist resort like garmisch-partenkirchen has to invent itself more or less every 10 to 15 years anew , because we are in world-wide competition here , " he told deutsche welle .
" that 's why we need impulses and changes in infrastructure . "
a successful olympic bid would accelerate proposed infrastructure changes .
one example is a plan that would divert traffic between munich and the austrian city of innsbruck from the center of garmisch to a proposed mountain tunnel .
without the games , the mayor says this could take 30 years .
with the games , there would be a deadline of 2018 .
big winter sporting events are n't new to garmisch , either .
the town is set to host the 2011 alpine skiing world championships , and is involved in a german new year 's tradition , as host of one of the events of the four hills ski-jumping tournament .
" the new year 's jump on the first of january is the biggest sporting event , spectator-wise , that we have , " said schmid .
" the olympic events have even fewer spectators . "
the whistler role he admits that while any single day of the olympics may draw fewer spectators than the four hills tournament , there is a big difference in that the olympics go on for two weeks .
but with munich as the official host city , schmid thinks garmisch 's contribution would be much smaller , similar to whistler 's role during the vancouver olympics in canada .
" we wo n't have the hockey games where you have 20,000 people still waiting for the tickets -lsb- like they had in vancouver -rsb- , " schmid said .
" we 'll have it much calmer , much more traditional , and that 's why i 'm not afraid of organizing it here . "
even with resistance from nolympia and local farmers , schmid says garmisch 's olympic plans can be carried out even without the disputed farmland .
he says one percent of the available farm land in garmisch is under consideration , and they can simply build around any pieces of land that do n't get leased .
talking to the neighbors but people are starting to come around .
at a press conference in garmisch to announce a new sponsor of the munich bid application , the bid committee 's communications director jochen faerber says increased dialogue has led to more support for the games in garmisch .
" if you have a party in your apartment , you inform the neighbors before you do the party .
and i think maybe at the beginning , sometimes that was missed , " faerber told deutsche welle " i think that kind of communication has changed now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor schmid hopes the olympics will boost infrastructire projects resistance , however , is still there .
andreas keller and nolympia are collecting signatures for a local vote to decide once and for all if the people of garmisch want the olympics or not .
if garmisch is out , munich 's chances of getting the olympics nearly vanish as there is no other location to host the alpine skiing events .
a vote creeps into murky legal waters , though , as garmisch has already signed a number of contracts as a potential host site .
ultimately , the final word will come from the international olympic committee in july 2011 , when it will name either munich , the french town of annecy , or pyeongchang in south korea as the host of the 2018 winter olympics .

among them was the integration of muslims in germany , a much-debated topic in recent weeks . talks between german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in berlin on saturday turned to the current debate in germany about immigrant integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the theme of muslim integration has been a hot topic lately both leaders pledged more to improve the integration of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish minority after the issue became a focus of public discussion .
following the meeting , merkel said germany should use the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between germany and turkey to take a look at the ongoing problems of integrating immigrant groups .
" we propose that everywhere in cities and towns where there are people of turkish origin , we use this event as a way of taking stock and seeing where we are and what has to be done , " merkel told reporters , adding that there were still problems to be addressed and that turkey was a willing and constructive partner .
" assimilation is not on our agenda , this is about integration , " merkel added , stressing that learning the german language was integral for the employment opportunities of young turks living in europe 's largest country .
wulff comments praised erdogan , meanwhile , said the integration of some 2 million turkish people living in germany was " very important , " and that both countries needed to take a closer look at what could be done to advance the process .

"
the integration debate in germany has flared in recent months after a central banker said germany was becoming " more stupid , " claiming immigrants from muslim nations are poorly educated and unproductive .
talks also focused on bilateral ties , the situation in turkey following september 's constitutional referendum , security issues and ankara 's eu membership bid .
erdogan told a joint news conference with merkel that turkey 's bid to enter the eu must not be allowed to slow , addressing concerns that some eu members are stalling entry of a muslim country to the club .
the two leaders met over breakfast in berlin after the previous night 's euro 2012 football qualifying match in the city , where germany beat turkey 3-0 .
' no clear prospect ' for eu membership prior to his visit , erdogan accused the eu of failing to provide his country with a clear prospect of joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff was praised for his comments about islam the eu commission is finalizing its annual report on how turkey is progressing on eu requirements .
an impasse over cyprus , an eu member that turkey has refused to recognize , will be seen as the main outstanding problem .
a representative emnid survey conducted last week showed that 69 percent of germans oppose eu membership for turkey .
meanwhile , horst seehofer , the head of the conservative christian social union party and state premier of bavaria , has called for a restriction of immigration to germany from certain cultures .
seehofer told focus magazine that migrants from turkey and arab countries had a harder time integrating , and that those immigrants who refused to integrate must be dealt with more firmly .

the event was the largest of its kind in bavaria for more than two decades . tens of thousands of people turned out on the streets of munich on saturday against the nuclear power policy of chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government .
a focus of the protest was the formation of a human chain , about 10 kilometers long , through the center of the city .
organizers said that some 50,000 people in all took part in the day 's events , while police put the number at around 25,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel claimed the protest showed the nuclear policy was deeply unpopular " it is an enormous success for us , " said marcus greineder , chief organizer of the bavaria chain reaction group , which organized the protest .
the heart of the demonstration was the city 's odeonsplatz , where a stage was set up to rally the crowd .
public ' simply does not accept ' social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader sigmar gabriel said that the turnout revealed the level of opposition to a planned extension to the operating lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" this shows once again that the population simply does n't accept government 's lobby group policy in favor of nuclear firms . "
five bavarian nuclear plants are affected by the extension , among them the particularly controversial isar 1 reactor which has been in use since 1977 .

fears for the danube river have eased since the accident , with polution levels down . fears that the danube river , the second longest in europe , could become contaminated after a toxic sludge spill have eased after hungarian authorities claimed that pollution levels in the river have dropped since thursday .
tibor dobson , the regional chief of hungary 's disaster relief services , said fresh data showed acidity levels - or ph - of around 8.2 in the danube , which could be considered " normal , " down from a level of around 9 when the sludge reached the river on thursday .
" these data give us hope ... and we have not experienced any damage on the main danube so far , " dobson told news agency reuters .
further upstream at the confluence of the raba and the danube , which is closer to the site of the disaster , ph levels showed a reading of 9 and there were also still sporadic sightings of dead fish , officials said .
environmental group greenpeace said in a statement on friday that levels of arsenic and mercury detected in samples of the red sludge taken on tuesday were still twice that normally found in so-called red mud .
the death toll following monday 's toxic spill rose to seven late friday after a body was found in a sludge-covered area , while another man died in hospital of injuries sustained in the spill .
more than 150 others were injured after the reservoir burst its banks at a rural alumina plant sending around 700,000 cubic meters -lrb- 24,720,000 cubic feet -rrb- of sludge streaming through nearby villages .
the pollution already wiped out all life in the smaller marcal tributary and there were fears it could spread down the danube to hungary 's southern neighbors .
eu answers call for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the areas hit by the spill will be uninhabitable , officials say on friday , hungary asked the european commission to contribute at least three experts under the bloc 's joint civil protection assistance measures to aid authorities with the cleanup efforts .
according to a statement on the european union ’ s website , several eu countries were forthcoming with offers to send disaster management experts .
it said hungary was awaiting the arrival on saturday morning of a liaison officer from the monitoring and information center of the european commission who would be responsible for coordinating the experts once they were on the ground in the contaminated areas .
despite the call for expertise , prime minister viktor orban earlier had insisted that the eu member country does not need financial assistance in removing the red slurry containing poisonous heavy metals from villages , fields and rivers .
orban conceded that , in some places , such as the hard-hit village of kolontar , there was little point in removing rubble left behind by the spill as habitation of the areas would no longer be possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de winter sports -pipe- 09.10.2010 munich 's 2018 olympic bid hinges on alpine town of garmisch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this meadow is a proposed site for the athletes ' village if munich wins the bid to host the 2018 winter olympics , about half of the events will take place in the alpine town of garmisch-partenkirchen .
but there are some people there who aren ’ t sure they even want the games . the tallest buildings in garmisch-partenkirchen near germany 's border with austria are churches , but they barely register on a landscape that is dominated by steep mountain foothills .
just outside of town , ski shops and hotels give way to farmland , bike trails , and horses grazing near a stream .
the town is germany 's most beloved ski resort , providing access to the country 's tallest mountain , the zugspitze .
it has an undeniable charm , but andreas keller , a 72-year-old retired professor , sees a looming threat to the small alpine resort town : the 2018 winter olympics .
" it 's a small alpine valley , " keller told deutsche welle .
" it 's not made for such a gigantic event . "
keller is part of a local volunteer campaign called nolympia , organized by members of the garmisch chapter of a bavarian environmental protection group .
nolympia is trying to keep garmisch-partenkirchen from being a junior partner in munich 's bid to host the 2018 winter olympics .
farmland in demand one of the biggest sticking points for nolympia is privately-owned farmland .
olympic organizers want to lease the land from the farmers and turn it into the athletes ' village .
andreas keller says the farmers are n't going to budge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas keller is worried the olympics will ruin garmisch " it 's not only the money .
it 's also the responsibility for the beauty of this valley , " he said .
" -lsb- the farmers -rsb- have a really good feeling that this must be kept and preserved . "
pointing at a map of garmisch that shows both developed areas of town and the undeveloped farmland , keller says as he 's watched his children and grandchildren grow up in garmisch , the green parts of the map keep getting smaller .
" garmisch is still a lovely town , but now a limit has been reached , " he said , adding that the city had decided to but a halt to the further development of farmland .
" now the rules should be broken for this one event ? "
the area should be preserved for future generations , keller says , not sacrificed for what he calls " a two week party for the international olympic committee . "
reinventing garmisch less than a mile from the farms andreas keller hopes to protect , black and white photos of local skiers from the past line the stone walls of the garmisch-partenkirchen city hall .
garmisch is no stranger to the olympics – it hosted the winter games in 1936 .
garmisch 's mayor , thomas schmid , hopes to see the games return in 2018 - and a boost in infrastructure development along with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch hosted the winter olympics in 1936 " a tourist resort like garmisch-partenkirchen has to invent itself more or less every 10 to 15 years anew , because we are in world-wide competition here , " he told deutsche welle .
" that 's why we need impulses and changes in infrastructure . "
a successful olympic bid would accelerate proposed infrastructure changes .
one example is a plan that would divert traffic between munich and the austrian city of innsbruck from the center of garmisch to a proposed mountain tunnel .
without the games , the mayor says this could take 30 years .
with the games , there would be a deadline of 2018 .
big winter sporting events are n't new to garmisch , either .
the town is set to host the 2011 alpine skiing world championships , and is involved in a german new year 's tradition , as host of one of the events of the four hills ski-jumping tournament .
" the new year 's jump on the first of january is the biggest sporting event , spectator-wise , that we have , " said schmid .
" the olympic events have even fewer spectators . "
the whistler role he admits that while any single day of the olympics may draw fewer spectators than the four hills tournament , there is a big difference in that the olympics go on for two weeks .
but with munich as the official host city , schmid thinks garmisch 's contribution would be much smaller , similar to whistler 's role during the vancouver olympics in canada .
" we wo n't have the hockey games where you have 20,000 people still waiting for the tickets -lsb- like they had in vancouver -rsb- , " schmid said .
" we 'll have it much calmer , much more traditional , and that 's why i 'm not afraid of organizing it here . "
even with resistance from nolympia and local farmers , schmid says garmisch 's olympic plans can be carried out even without the disputed farmland .
he says one percent of the available farm land in garmisch is under consideration , and they can simply build around any pieces of land that do n't get leased .
talking to the neighbors but people are starting to come around .
at a press conference in garmisch to announce a new sponsor of the munich bid application , the bid committee 's communications director jochen faerber says increased dialogue has led to more support for the games in garmisch .
" if you have a party in your apartment , you inform the neighbors before you do the party .
and i think maybe at the beginning , sometimes that was missed , " faerber told deutsche welle " i think that kind of communication has changed now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor schmid hopes the olympics will boost infrastructire projects resistance , however , is still there .
andreas keller and nolympia are collecting signatures for a local vote to decide once and for all if the people of garmisch want the olympics or not .
if garmisch is out , munich 's chances of getting the olympics nearly vanish as there is no other location to host the alpine skiing events .
a vote creeps into murky legal waters , though , as garmisch has already signed a number of contracts as a potential host site .
ultimately , the final word will come from the international olympic committee in july 2011 , when it will name either munich , the french town of annecy , or pyeongchang in south korea as the host of the 2018 winter olympics .

among them was the integration of muslims in germany , a much-debated topic in recent weeks . talks between german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in berlin on saturday turned to the current debate in germany about immigrant integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the theme of muslim integration has been a hot topic lately both leaders pledged more to improve the integration of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish minority after the issue became a focus of public discussion .
following the meeting , merkel said germany should use the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between germany and turkey to take a look at the ongoing problems of integrating immigrant groups .
" we propose that everywhere in cities and towns where there are people of turkish origin , we use this event as a way of taking stock and seeing where we are and what has to be done , " merkel told reporters , adding that there were still problems to be addressed and that turkey was a willing and constructive partner .
" assimilation is not on our agenda , this is about integration , " merkel added , stressing that learning the german language was integral for the employment opportunities of young turks living in europe 's largest country .
wulff comments praised erdogan , meanwhile , said the integration of some 2 million turkish people living in germany was " very important , " and that both countries needed to take a closer look at what could be done to advance the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan stressed a need for a solid prospect of eu membership the turkish premier went on to welcome recent comments by german president christian wulff , who said on the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 that islam was " now a part of germany . "
the integration debate in germany has flared in recent months after a central banker said germany was becoming " more stupid , " claiming immigrants from muslim nations are poorly educated and unproductive .
talks also focused on bilateral ties , the situation in turkey following september 's constitutional referendum , security issues and ankara 's eu membership bid .
erdogan told a joint news conference with merkel that turkey 's bid to enter the eu must not be allowed to slow , addressing concerns that some eu members are stalling entry of a muslim country to the club .
the two leaders met over breakfast in berlin after the previous night 's euro 2012 football qualifying match in the city , where germany beat turkey 3-0 .
' no clear prospect ' for eu membership prior to his visit , erdogan accused the eu of failing to provide his country with a clear prospect of joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff was praised for his comments about islam the eu commission is finalizing its annual report on how turkey is progressing on eu requirements .
an impasse over cyprus , an eu member that turkey has refused to recognize , will be seen as the main outstanding problem .
a representative emnid survey conducted last week showed that 69 percent of germans oppose eu membership for turkey .
meanwhile , horst seehofer , the head of the conservative christian social union party and state premier of bavaria , has called for a restriction of immigration to germany from certain cultures .

his ensemble is orchestra-in-residence at this year 's beethovenfest bonn . conductor paavo jarvi has received numerous awards , including a grammy and an echo classic conductor of the year distinction in 2010 .
born in estonia , he moved to the united states , where he studied with leonard bernstein . he is currently music director of both the cincinnati symphony orchestra and the frankfurt radio symphony orchestra .
since 2004 , he 's been artistic director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie -lrb- german chamber philharmonic -rrb- of bremen , the beethovenfest 's orchestra-in-residence .
deutsche welle spoke with jarvi about the aims of the festival and the feeling behind the music performed there . deutsche welle : there is an ongoing relationship between the deutsche kammerphilharmonie and the beethovenfest , with the kammerphilharmonie being the orchestra-in-residence .
has this collaboration influenced the culture and development of this body of musicians ? paavo jarvi : an orchestra that functions on a self-governing basis as we do needs good friends and good partners .
and certainly the beethovenfest in bonn has been a fantastic partner .
it does help to have a festival that is well run , has a good infrastructure , and has - most importantly - a real guiding light .
i mean by that -lsb- beethovenfest director -rsb- ilona schmiel , who is an enormous source of energy .
her imagination and her interest in doing something new are really fantastic . we know that beethoven did n't have fond memories of bonn .
but is there something here , in the public and the atmosphere or in the expectations of the people , that strikes you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn is home to the annual beethovenfest the festival has established itself as a place that really makes beethoven its center .
and let 's face it : we 're performing in a relatively modern hall , and the city is obviously different from when beethoven was walking around here .
but that is not so important .
what is important is that the idea lives , the idea is strong , and -lsb- bonn -rsb- is the right place to create a festival around beethoven , because it is his birthplace .
and to me , the real souls of the festival are the ones who create it .
what beethoven thought about the city when he was here is almost irrelevant . this year 's beethovenfest also focuses on works by composer robert schumann .
what is there to discover about such a frequently performed composer ? it 's the type of gestures that schumann makes in his music - emotional , dramatic gestures that communicate to you with such directness and sincerity .
and there 's that impulsive , neurotic energy , the extremes of expression , the moments that can go to unbelievable euphoria and , a second later , -lsb- to -rsb- the deepest , darkest melancholy . to wear your heart on your sleeve in public , and go from one extreme to another and not be ashamed of it , is something that we have always been taught to be wrong .
we 're uncomfortable with that .
what we are trying to do with the kammerphilharmonie is to bring out just this aspect .
music by schumann needs to be exaggerated on every level .
exaggerated , not put into an acceptable , comfortable norm . against the backdrop of thousands of recordings , and many , many others who have preceded you , do you feel the need to shake up the routine ? one of the most difficult things i find , in general , is changing old habits .
people who have grown up with brahms and schumann and beethoven have heard , so many times , those pieces in a certain way .
they are simply so engrained that even if -lsb- these people -rsb- sometimes intellectually try to change something , when it comes to performance , they often fall back to those gestures that they heard when they were young .
you simply need to have enough time and repetition to create a new tradition and make it your own . that is something that is doable , especially if we do these beethoven and schumann " total immersion courses " - all symphonies in three days , or all schumann symphonies and overtures in two days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playing a cycle , like all beethoven symphonies , brings you amazingly close to the composer , says jarvi it 's amazing how close you can get to a composer if you really make an incredibly concentrated program of it and follow some principles and see how they work in other symphonies , overtures and so on .
it gradually becomes a language that you identify with , not just intellectually ; it becomes part of your genetics . would you prefer to shake up the routine or to strive for an authoritative interpretation ? l do n't want to change things per se or to create something that has n't been done .
quite the opposite .
i want to do something that makes sense to me .
the only reason i rethink certain things is because they never made sense to me to begin with . maybe one of the reasons our beethoven is successful is that we do keep a lot of tradition in it .
it has to be organic and it has to have an inner logic . interview : rick fulker editor : elaine yeung / louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

among them was the integration of muslims in germany , a much-debated topic in recent weeks . talks between german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in berlin on saturday turned to the current debate in germany about immigrant integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the theme of muslim integration has been a hot topic lately both leaders pledged more to improve the integration of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish minority after the issue became a focus of public discussion .
following the meeting , merkel said germany should use the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between germany and turkey to take a look at the ongoing problems of integrating immigrant groups .
" we propose that everywhere in cities and towns where there are people of turkish origin , we use this event as a way of taking stock and seeing where we are and what has to be done , " merkel told reporters , adding that there were still problems to be addressed and that turkey was a willing and constructive partner .
" assimilation is not on our agenda , this is about integration , " merkel added , stressing that learning the german language was integral for the employment opportunities of young turks living in europe 's largest country .
wulff comments praised erdogan , meanwhile , said the integration of some 2 million turkish people living in germany was " very important , " and that both countries needed to take a closer look at what could be done to advance the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan stressed a need for a solid prospect of eu membership the turkish premier went on to welcome recent comments by german president christian wulff , who said on the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 that islam was " now a part of germany . "
the integration debate in germany has flared in recent months after a central banker said germany was becoming " more stupid , " claiming immigrants from muslim nations are poorly educated and unproductive .
talks also focused on bilateral ties , the situation in turkey following september 's constitutional referendum , security issues and ankara 's eu membership bid .
erdogan told a joint news conference with merkel that turkey 's bid to enter the eu must not be allowed to slow , addressing concerns that some eu members are stalling entry of a muslim country to the club .
the two leaders met over breakfast in berlin after the previous night 's euro 2012 football qualifying match in the city , where germany beat turkey 3-0 .
' no clear prospect ' for eu membership prior to his visit , erdogan accused the eu of failing to provide his country with a clear prospect of joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff was praised for his comments about islam the eu commission is finalizing its annual report on how turkey is progressing on eu requirements .
an impasse over cyprus , an eu member that turkey has refused to recognize , will be seen as the main outstanding problem .
a representative emnid survey conducted last week showed that 69 percent of germans oppose eu membership for turkey .
meanwhile , horst seehofer , the head of the conservative christian social union party and state premier of bavaria , has called for a restriction of immigration to germany from certain cultures .
seehofer told focus magazine that migrants from turkey and arab countries had a harder time integrating , and that those immigrants who refused to integrate must be dealt with more firmly .

the event was the largest of its kind in bavaria for more than two decades . tens of thousands of people turned out on the streets of munich on saturday against the nuclear power policy of chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government .
a focus of the protest was the formation of a human chain , about 10 kilometers long , through the center of the city .
organizers said that some 50,000 people in all took part in the day 's events , while police put the number at around 25,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel claimed the protest showed the nuclear policy was deeply unpopular " it is an enormous success for us , " said marcus greineder , chief organizer of the bavaria chain reaction group , which organized the protest .
the heart of the demonstration was the city 's odeonsplatz , where a stage was set up to rally the crowd .
public ' simply does not accept ' social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader sigmar gabriel said that the turnout revealed the level of opposition to a planned extension to the operating lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" this shows once again that the population simply does n't accept government 's lobby group policy in favor of nuclear firms . "
five bavarian nuclear plants are affected by the extension , among them the particularly controversial isar 1 reactor which has been in use since 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isar 1 plant is perhaps the most controversial of bavaria 's nuclear sites several political parties and action groups rallied people to join the demonstration , calling for a move away from nuclear energy towards renewable energy .
reprocessing idea abandoned the action was the biggest anti-nuclear event in bavaria in decades .
a rally against plans to build a nuclear reprocessing plant in wackersdorf in 1985 - which was later abandoned - was attended by 30,000 to 50,000 people .
organizers say around 100,000 people took part in a demonstration against the planned extensions in berlin in september .
police put the number at 40,000 .
a previous german government of the spd and green party decided to close all nuclear plants by 2021 , but the current coalition has plans to extend that deadline by an average of 12 years .

iraqi christians are particularly fearful of the removal of the main barrier between them and their persecutors . their churches are burnt-out husks and heaps of rubble .
their businesses are targeted by extremists .
their leaders are kidnapped and assassinated .
the christian minority in iraq , once a community left in peace to prosper , continues to be under threat from a campaign of persecution which has forced as many as 500,000 christians to flee the country .
during the reign of saddam hussein , the estimated 1.4 million christians - many of them chaldean-assyrians and armenians , with small numbers of roman catholics - were generally left alone if they did n't oppose the government and they lived in relative peace with the country 's sunnis and shiites .
some , such as tariq aziz , saddam 's foreign minister and deputy prime minister , rose to the highest levels of power .
things changed after the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq toppled saddam 's regime .
christians became a target of violence when islamist groups and ordinary muslims angered by the military action began seeing them as the enemy , associating with them with the " crusaders " - the invading armies of the united states and britain .
tensions over their religious ties with the west and their differing beliefs to the strict islamic majority , which had been simmering for years , spilled over as the occupying forces dug in .
" iraqi christians became caught up in the overlapping violence and multiple conflicts unleashed after 2003 , " dr. kristian ulrichsen , an iraq expert at the london school of economics and political science , told deutsche welle .
" they became exposed to the similar patterns of kidnappings , extortion , beheadings , rape and forced taxation that affected all other communities as the erosion of central government control left a security vacuum that was exploited by organised and opportunistic criminality and anti-occupation resistance groups . " " in addition to this , christians specifically were targeted by church bombings and assassination attempts owing to a perceived association with the aims and intentions of the occupying forces . " association with occupying powers makes christians targets in 2004 , insurgents launched a coordinated bombing campaign targeted churches in baghdad .
in 2007 , after pope benedict xvi made comments perceived to be anti-islam , nationwide attacks on churches hit an all-time high and a priest in the northern city of mosul was kidnapped and later found beheaded .
in january 2009 , 40 iraqi christians were killed and approximately 12,000 fled their homes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : churches have been targeted since the 2003 us-led invasion in february this year , at least 10 iraqi christians were killed by unknown gunmen in mosul as the country was preparing for the march 7 elections .
the escalating violence ahead of the ballot led to hundreds of iraqi christians taking to the streets in a number of protests , chanting slogans such as " stop the killing of christians . " during the years since the invasion , life for the christian minority has become beset by danger .
the waves of violent attacks against churches , businesses and homes have forced more than half of the christian population to flee for their lives , according to statistcs from the un high commission for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
those churches which remain standing are mostly empty , their congregations long gone or too afraid to attend . " the christian minority in iraq has been reduced to a shadow of its former self , " said ulrichsen .
" up to two-thirds of the pre-war community has been displaced or forced to flee the country .
although conditions in iraq have improved somewhat since 2007 , the security situation remains intensely fragile and prone to reversal , and the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes has been very slow and halting . " " there 's a real possibility that 2,000 years of settlement by christian communities in iraq is in danger of near-total extinction . " us withdrawal leave christians ' fate in iraqi hands bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : congregations have dwindled through fear and exodus as the united states steps up its military withdrawal from iraq , the christian minority is forced to look at the iraqi security structure for protection .
however , the prospect of being protecetd by the iraqi police and armed forces fails to instill any confidence in the christian minority . " the greatest concern about a us pullout is that extremists will exploit any lapses in security and attack vulnerable groups , including christians , " samer muscati , an iraq expert from the middle east division at human rights watch , told deutsche welle . " although the iraqi government publicly condemns violence against christians and other minority groups , it has not taken measures to bolster security in areas where minorities are particularly vulnerable to attacks , and it has not thoroughly investigated attacks , " he added .
" iraqi security forces rarely apprehend , prosecute and punish perpetrators of such attacks , which has created a climate of impunity . " christians search for ways to protect themselves one muted proposal to protect the christian minority involves the creation of an autonomous province on a neglected area of land located to the north and west of mosul , called ninawah plain , which would act as a sanctuary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christians look for protection away from high-risk areas while advocates of the idea say it would n't stop the violence against christians in the large , high-risk cities of mosul , baghdad , and al-basrah , it would give the christians a place where their needs could be met , their beliefs supported and their security guaranteed . the proposals suggest that ninaweh plain would an autonomous administrative region in which the christian minority could govern themselves and would be free to participate in the federalist system which is developing in iraq . creation of autonomous region plagued by problems however , the idea of an autonomous region for the christian minority in reality looks unviable . " the image of a real autonomy is unrealistic , " nizar hanna , director of the assyrian democratic movement 's baghdad office , told deutsche welle .
" up to now , there are no concrete plans which show how this would work .

among them was the integration of muslims in germany , a much-debated topic in recent weeks . talks between german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in berlin on saturday turned to the current debate in germany about immigrant integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the theme of muslim integration has been a hot topic lately both leaders pledged more to improve the integration of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish minority after the issue became a focus of public discussion .
following the meeting , merkel said germany should use the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between germany and turkey to take a look at the ongoing problems of integrating immigrant groups .
" we propose that everywhere in cities and towns where there are people of turkish origin , we use this event as a way of taking stock and seeing where we are and what has to be done , " merkel told reporters , adding that there were still problems to be addressed and that turkey was a willing and constructive partner .
" assimilation is not on our agenda , this is about integration , " merkel added , stressing that learning the german language was integral for the employment opportunities of young turks living in europe 's largest country .
wulff comments praised erdogan , meanwhile , said the integration of some 2 million turkish people living in germany was " very important , " and that both countries needed to take a closer look at what could be done to advance the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan stressed a need for a solid prospect of eu membership the turkish premier went on to welcome recent comments by german president christian wulff , who said on the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 that islam was " now a part of germany . "
the integration debate in germany has flared in recent months after a central banker said germany was becoming " more stupid , " claiming immigrants from muslim nations are poorly educated and unproductive .
talks also focused on bilateral ties , the situation in turkey following september 's constitutional referendum , security issues and ankara 's eu membership bid .
erdogan told a joint news conference with merkel that turkey 's bid to enter the eu must not be allowed to slow , addressing concerns that some eu members are stalling entry of a muslim country to the club .
the two leaders met over breakfast in berlin after the previous night 's euro 2012 football qualifying match in the city , where germany beat turkey 3-0 .
' no clear prospect ' for eu membership prior to his visit , erdogan accused the eu of failing to provide his country with a clear prospect of joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff was praised for his comments about islam the eu commission is finalizing its annual report on how turkey is progressing on eu requirements .
an impasse over cyprus , an eu member that turkey has refused to recognize , will be seen as the main outstanding problem .
a representative emnid survey conducted last week showed that 69 percent of germans oppose eu membership for turkey .
meanwhile , horst seehofer , the head of the conservative christian social union party and state premier of bavaria , has called for a restriction of immigration to germany from certain cultures .
seehofer told focus magazine that migrants from turkey and arab countries had a harder time integrating , and that those immigrants who refused to integrate must be dealt with more firmly .

his ensemble is orchestra-in-residence at this year 's beethovenfest bonn . conductor paavo jarvi has received numerous awards , including a grammy and an echo classic conductor of the year distinction in 2010 .
born in estonia , he moved to the united states , where he studied with leonard bernstein . he is currently music director of both the cincinnati symphony orchestra and the frankfurt radio symphony orchestra .
since 2004 , he 's been artistic director of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie -lrb- german chamber philharmonic -rrb- of bremen , the beethovenfest 's orchestra-in-residence .
deutsche welle spoke with jarvi about the aims of the festival and the feeling behind the music performed there . deutsche welle : there is an ongoing relationship between the deutsche kammerphilharmonie and the beethovenfest , with the kammerphilharmonie being the orchestra-in-residence .
has this collaboration influenced the culture and development of this body of musicians ? paavo jarvi : an orchestra that functions on a self-governing basis as we do needs good friends and good partners .
and certainly the beethovenfest in bonn has been a fantastic partner .
it does help to have a festival that is well run , has a good infrastructure , and has - most importantly - a real guiding light .
i mean by that -lsb- beethovenfest director -rsb- ilona schmiel , who is an enormous source of energy .
her imagination and her interest in doing something new are really fantastic . we know that beethoven did n't have fond memories of bonn .
but is there something here , in the public and the atmosphere or in the expectations of the people , that strikes you ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn is home to the annual beethovenfest the festival has established itself as a place that really makes beethoven its center .
and let 's face it : we 're performing in a relatively modern hall , and the city is obviously different from when beethoven was walking around here .
but that is not so important .
what is important is that the idea lives , the idea is strong , and -lsb- bonn -rsb- is the right place to create a festival around beethoven , because it is his birthplace .
and to me , the real souls of the festival are the ones who create it .
what beethoven thought about the city when he was here is almost irrelevant . this year 's beethovenfest also focuses on works by composer robert schumann .
what is there to discover about such a frequently performed composer ? it 's the type of gestures that schumann makes in his music - emotional , dramatic gestures that communicate to you with such directness and sincerity .
and there 's that impulsive , neurotic energy , the extremes of expression , the moments that can go to unbelievable euphoria and , a second later , -lsb- to -rsb- the deepest , darkest melancholy . to wear your heart on your sleeve in public , and go from one extreme to another and not be ashamed of it , is something that we have always been taught to be wrong .
we 're uncomfortable with that .
what we are trying to do with the kammerphilharmonie is to bring out just this aspect .
music by schumann needs to be exaggerated on every level .
exaggerated , not put into an acceptable , comfortable norm . against the backdrop of thousands of recordings , and many , many others who have preceded you , do you feel the need to shake up the routine ? one of the most difficult things i find , in general , is changing old habits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de winter sports -pipe- 09.10.2010 munich 's 2018 olympic bid hinges on alpine town of garmisch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this meadow is a proposed site for the athletes ' village if munich wins the bid to host the 2018 winter olympics , about half of the events will take place in the alpine town of garmisch-partenkirchen .
but there are some people there who aren ’ t sure they even want the games . the tallest buildings in garmisch-partenkirchen near germany 's border with austria are churches , but they barely register on a landscape that is dominated by steep mountain foothills .
just outside of town , ski shops and hotels give way to farmland , bike trails , and horses grazing near a stream .
the town is germany 's most beloved ski resort , providing access to the country 's tallest mountain , the zugspitze .
it has an undeniable charm , but andreas keller , a 72-year-old retired professor , sees a looming threat to the small alpine resort town : the 2018 winter olympics .
" it 's a small alpine valley , " keller told deutsche welle .
" it 's not made for such a gigantic event . "
keller is part of a local volunteer campaign called nolympia , organized by members of the garmisch chapter of a bavarian environmental protection group .
nolympia is trying to keep garmisch-partenkirchen from being a junior partner in munich 's bid to host the 2018 winter olympics .
farmland in demand one of the biggest sticking points for nolympia is privately-owned farmland .
olympic organizers want to lease the land from the farmers and turn it into the athletes ' village .
andreas keller says the farmers are n't going to budge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas keller is worried the olympics will ruin garmisch " it 's not only the money .
it 's also the responsibility for the beauty of this valley , " he said .
" -lsb- the farmers -rsb- have a really good feeling that this must be kept and preserved . "
pointing at a map of garmisch that shows both developed areas of town and the undeveloped farmland , keller says as he 's watched his children and grandchildren grow up in garmisch , the green parts of the map keep getting smaller .
" garmisch is still a lovely town , but now a limit has been reached , " he said , adding that the city had decided to but a halt to the further development of farmland .
" now the rules should be broken for this one event ? "
the area should be preserved for future generations , keller says , not sacrificed for what he calls " a two week party for the international olympic committee . "
reinventing garmisch less than a mile from the farms andreas keller hopes to protect , black and white photos of local skiers from the past line the stone walls of the garmisch-partenkirchen city hall .
garmisch is no stranger to the olympics – it hosted the winter games in 1936 .
garmisch 's mayor , thomas schmid , hopes to see the games return in 2018 - and a boost in infrastructure development along with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch hosted the winter olympics in 1936 " a tourist resort like garmisch-partenkirchen has to invent itself more or less every 10 to 15 years anew , because we are in world-wide competition here , " he told deutsche welle .
" that 's why we need impulses and changes in infrastructure . "
a successful olympic bid would accelerate proposed infrastructure changes .
one example is a plan that would divert traffic between munich and the austrian city of innsbruck from the center of garmisch to a proposed mountain tunnel .
without the games , the mayor says this could take 30 years .
with the games , there would be a deadline of 2018 .
big winter sporting events are n't new to garmisch , either .
the town is set to host the 2011 alpine skiing world championships , and is involved in a german new year 's tradition , as host of one of the events of the four hills ski-jumping tournament .
" the new year 's jump on the first of january is the biggest sporting event , spectator-wise , that we have , " said schmid .
" the olympic events have even fewer spectators . "
the whistler role he admits that while any single day of the olympics may draw fewer spectators than the four hills tournament , there is a big difference in that the olympics go on for two weeks .
but with munich as the official host city , schmid thinks garmisch 's contribution would be much smaller , similar to whistler 's role during the vancouver olympics in canada .
" we wo n't have the hockey games where you have 20,000 people still waiting for the tickets -lsb- like they had in vancouver -rsb- , " schmid said .
" we 'll have it much calmer , much more traditional , and that 's why i 'm not afraid of organizing it here . "
even with resistance from nolympia and local farmers , schmid says garmisch 's olympic plans can be carried out even without the disputed farmland .
he says one percent of the available farm land in garmisch is under consideration , and they can simply build around any pieces of land that do n't get leased .
talking to the neighbors but people are starting to come around .
at a press conference in garmisch to announce a new sponsor of the munich bid application , the bid committee 's communications director jochen faerber says increased dialogue has led to more support for the games in garmisch .
" if you have a party in your apartment , you inform the neighbors before you do the party .
and i think maybe at the beginning , sometimes that was missed , " faerber told deutsche welle " i think that kind of communication has changed now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor schmid hopes the olympics will boost infrastructire projects resistance , however , is still there .
andreas keller and nolympia are collecting signatures for a local vote to decide once and for all if the people of garmisch want the olympics or not .
if garmisch is out , munich 's chances of getting the olympics nearly vanish as there is no other location to host the alpine skiing events .
a vote creeps into murky legal waters , though , as garmisch has already signed a number of contracts as a potential host site .
ultimately , the final word will come from the international olympic committee in july 2011 , when it will name either munich , the french town of annecy , or pyeongchang in south korea as the host of the 2018 winter olympics .

but there are some people there who aren ’ t sure they even want the games . the tallest buildings in garmisch-partenkirchen near germany 's border with austria are churches , but they barely register on a landscape that is dominated by steep mountain foothills .
just outside of town , ski shops and hotels give way to farmland , bike trails , and horses grazing near a stream .
the town is germany 's most beloved ski resort , providing access to the country 's tallest mountain , the zugspitze .
it has an undeniable charm , but andreas keller , a 72-year-old retired professor , sees a looming threat to the small alpine resort town : the 2018 winter olympics .
" it 's a small alpine valley , " keller told deutsche welle .
" it 's not made for such a gigantic event . "
keller is part of a local volunteer campaign called nolympia , organized by members of the garmisch chapter of a bavarian environmental protection group .
nolympia is trying to keep garmisch-partenkirchen from being a junior partner in munich 's bid to host the 2018 winter olympics .
farmland in demand one of the biggest sticking points for nolympia is privately-owned farmland .
olympic organizers want to lease the land from the farmers and turn it into the athletes ' village .
andreas keller says the farmers are n't going to budge .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas keller is worried the olympics will ruin garmisch " it 's not only the money .
it 's also the responsibility for the beauty of this valley , " he said .
" -lsb- the farmers -rsb- have a really good feeling that this must be kept and preserved . "
pointing at a map of garmisch that shows both developed areas of town and the undeveloped farmland , keller says as he 's watched his children and grandchildren grow up in garmisch , the green parts of the map keep getting smaller .
" garmisch is still a lovely town , but now a limit has been reached , " he said , adding that the city had decided to but a halt to the further development of farmland .
" now the rules should be broken for this one event ? "
the area should be preserved for future generations , keller says , not sacrificed for what he calls " a two week party for the international olympic committee . "
reinventing garmisch less than a mile from the farms andreas keller hopes to protect , black and white photos of local skiers from the past line the stone walls of the garmisch-partenkirchen city hall .
garmisch is no stranger to the olympics – it hosted the winter games in 1936 .
garmisch 's mayor , thomas schmid , hopes to see the games return in 2018 - and a boost in infrastructure development along with them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : garmisch hosted the winter olympics in 1936 " a tourist resort like garmisch-partenkirchen has to invent itself more or less every 10 to 15 years anew , because we are in world-wide competition here , " he told deutsche welle .
" that 's why we need impulses and changes in infrastructure . "
a successful olympic bid would accelerate proposed infrastructure changes .
one example is a plan that would divert traffic between munich and the austrian city of innsbruck from the center of garmisch to a proposed mountain tunnel .
without the games , the mayor says this could take 30 years .
with the games , there would be a deadline of 2018 .
big winter sporting events are n't new to garmisch , either .
the town is set to host the 2011 alpine skiing world championships , and is involved in a german new year 's tradition , as host of one of the events of the four hills ski-jumping tournament .
" the new year 's jump on the first of january is the biggest sporting event , spectator-wise , that we have , " said schmid .
" the olympic events have even fewer spectators . "
the whistler role he admits that while any single day of the olympics may draw fewer spectators than the four hills tournament , there is a big difference in that the olympics go on for two weeks .
but with munich as the official host city , schmid thinks garmisch 's contribution would be much smaller , similar to whistler 's role during the vancouver olympics in canada .
" we wo n't have the hockey games where you have 20,000 people still waiting for the tickets -lsb- like they had in vancouver -rsb- , " schmid said .
" we 'll have it much calmer , much more traditional , and that 's why i 'm not afraid of organizing it here . "
even with resistance from nolympia and local farmers , schmid says garmisch 's olympic plans can be carried out even without the disputed farmland .
he says one percent of the available farm land in garmisch is under consideration , and they can simply build around any pieces of land that do n't get leased .
talking to the neighbors but people are starting to come around .
at a press conference in garmisch to announce a new sponsor of the munich bid application , the bid committee 's communications director jochen faerber says increased dialogue has led to more support for the games in garmisch .
" if you have a party in your apartment , you inform the neighbors before you do the party .
and i think maybe at the beginning , sometimes that was missed , " faerber told deutsche welle " i think that kind of communication has changed now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor schmid hopes the olympics will boost infrastructire projects resistance , however , is still there .
andreas keller and nolympia are collecting signatures for a local vote to decide once and for all if the people of garmisch want the olympics or not .
if garmisch is out , munich 's chances of getting the olympics nearly vanish as there is no other location to host the alpine skiing events .
a vote creeps into murky legal waters , though , as garmisch has already signed a number of contracts as a potential host site .
ultimately , the final word will come from the international olympic committee in july 2011 , when it will name either munich , the french town of annecy , or pyeongchang in south korea as the host of the 2018 winter olympics .

the event was the largest of its kind in bavaria for more than two decades . tens of thousands of people turned out on the streets of munich on saturday against the nuclear power policy of chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government .
a focus of the protest was the formation of a human chain , about 10 kilometers long , through the center of the city .
organizers said that some 50,000 people in all took part in the day 's events , while police put the number at around 25,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel claimed the protest showed the nuclear policy was deeply unpopular " it is an enormous success for us , " said marcus greineder , chief organizer of the bavaria chain reaction group , which organized the protest .
the heart of the demonstration was the city 's odeonsplatz , where a stage was set up to rally the crowd .
public ' simply does not accept ' social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- leader sigmar gabriel said that the turnout revealed the level of opposition to a planned extension to the operating lifespans of germany 's nuclear power plants .
" this shows once again that the population simply does n't accept government 's lobby group policy in favor of nuclear firms . "
five bavarian nuclear plants are affected by the extension , among them the particularly controversial isar 1 reactor which has been in use since 1977 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the isar 1 plant is perhaps the most controversial of bavaria 's nuclear sites several political parties and action groups rallied people to join the demonstration , calling for a move away from nuclear energy towards renewable energy .
reprocessing idea abandoned the action was the biggest anti-nuclear event in bavaria in decades .
a rally against plans to build a nuclear reprocessing plant in wackersdorf in 1985 - which was later abandoned - was attended by 30,000 to 50,000 people .
organizers say around 100,000 people took part in a demonstration against the planned extensions in berlin in september .
police put the number at 40,000 .
a previous german government of the spd and green party decided to close all nuclear plants by 2021 , but the current coalition has plans to extend that deadline by an average of 12 years .

fears for the danube river have eased since the accident , with polution levels down . fears that the danube river , the second longest in europe , could become contaminated after a toxic sludge spill have eased after hungarian authorities claimed that pollution levels in the river have dropped since thursday .
tibor dobson , the regional chief of hungary 's disaster relief services , said fresh data showed acidity levels - or ph - of around 8.2 in the danube , which could be considered " normal , " down from a level of around 9 when the sludge reached the river on thursday .
" these data give us hope ... and we have not experienced any damage on the main danube so far , " dobson told news agency reuters .
further upstream at the confluence of the raba and the danube , which is closer to the site of the disaster , ph levels showed a reading of 9 and there were also still sporadic sightings of dead fish , officials said .
environmental group greenpeace said in a statement on friday that levels of arsenic and mercury detected in samples of the red sludge taken on tuesday were still twice that normally found in so-called red mud .
the death toll following monday 's toxic spill rose to seven late friday after a body was found in a sludge-covered area , while another man died in hospital of injuries sustained in the spill .
more than 150 others were injured after the reservoir burst its banks at a rural alumina plant sending around 700,000 cubic meters -lrb- 24,720,000 cubic feet -rrb- of sludge streaming through nearby villages .
the pollution already wiped out all life in the smaller marcal tributary and there were fears it could spread down the danube to hungary 's southern neighbors .
eu answers call for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the areas hit by the spill will be uninhabitable , officials say on friday , hungary asked the european commission to contribute at least three experts under the bloc 's joint civil protection assistance measures to aid authorities with the cleanup efforts .
according to a statement on the european union ’ s website , several eu countries were forthcoming with offers to send disaster management experts .
it said hungary was awaiting the arrival on saturday morning of a liaison officer from the monitoring and information center of the european commission who would be responsible for coordinating the experts once they were on the ground in the contaminated areas .
despite the call for expertise , prime minister viktor orban earlier had insisted that the eu member country does not need financial assistance in removing the red slurry containing poisonous heavy metals from villages , fields and rivers .
orban conceded that , in some places , such as the hard-hit village of kolontar , there was little point in removing rubble left behind by the spill as habitation of the areas would no longer be possible .

fears for the danube river have eased since the accident , with polution levels down . fears that the danube river , the second longest in europe , could become contaminated after a toxic sludge spill have eased after hungarian authorities claimed that pollution levels in the river have dropped since thursday .
tibor dobson , the regional chief of hungary 's disaster relief services , said fresh data showed acidity levels - or ph - of around 8.2 in the danube , which could be considered " normal , " down from a level of around 9 when the sludge reached the river on thursday .
" these data give us hope ... and we have not experienced any damage on the main danube so far , " dobson told news agency reuters .
further upstream at the confluence of the raba and the danube , which is closer to the site of the disaster , ph levels showed a reading of 9 and there were also still sporadic sightings of dead fish , officials said .
environmental group greenpeace said in a statement on friday that levels of arsenic and mercury detected in samples of the red sludge taken on tuesday were still twice that normally found in so-called red mud .
the death toll following monday 's toxic spill rose to seven late friday after a body was found in a sludge-covered area , while another man died in hospital of injuries sustained in the spill .
more than 150 others were injured after the reservoir burst its banks at a rural alumina plant sending around 700,000 cubic meters -lrb- 24,720,000 cubic feet -rrb- of sludge streaming through nearby villages .
the pollution already wiped out all life in the smaller marcal tributary and there were fears it could spread down the danube to hungary 's southern neighbors .
eu answers call for help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of the areas hit by the spill will be uninhabitable , officials say on friday , hungary asked the european commission to contribute at least three experts under the bloc 's joint civil protection assistance measures to aid authorities with the cleanup efforts .
according to a statement on the european union ’ s website , several eu countries were forthcoming with offers to send disaster management experts .
it said hungary was awaiting the arrival on saturday morning of a liaison officer from the monitoring and information center of the european commission who would be responsible for coordinating the experts once they were on the ground in the contaminated areas .
despite the call for expertise , prime minister viktor orban earlier had insisted that the eu member country does not need financial assistance in removing the red slurry containing poisonous heavy metals from villages , fields and rivers .
orban conceded that , in some places , such as the hard-hit village of kolontar , there was little point in removing rubble left behind by the spill as habitation of the areas would no longer be possible .

among them was the integration of muslims in germany , a much-debated topic in recent weeks . talks between german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan in berlin on saturday turned to the current debate in germany about immigrant integration .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the theme of muslim integration has been a hot topic lately both leaders pledged more to improve the integration of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish minority after the issue became a focus of public discussion .
following the meeting , merkel said germany should use the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between germany and turkey to take a look at the ongoing problems of integrating immigrant groups .
" we propose that everywhere in cities and towns where there are people of turkish origin , we use this event as a way of taking stock and seeing where we are and what has to be done , " merkel told reporters , adding that there were still problems to be addressed and that turkey was a willing and constructive partner .
" assimilation is not on our agenda , this is about integration , " merkel added , stressing that learning the german language was integral for the employment opportunities of young turks living in europe 's largest country .
wulff comments praised erdogan , meanwhile , said the integration of some 2 million turkish people living in germany was " very important , " and that both countries needed to take a closer look at what could be done to advance the process .

"
the integration debate in germany has flared in recent months after a central banker said germany was becoming " more stupid , " claiming immigrants from muslim nations are poorly educated and unproductive .
talks also focused on bilateral ties , the situation in turkey following september 's constitutional referendum , security issues and ankara 's eu membership bid .
erdogan told a joint news conference with merkel that turkey 's bid to enter the eu must not be allowed to slow , addressing concerns that some eu members are stalling entry of a muslim country to the club .
the two leaders met over breakfast in berlin after the previous night 's euro 2012 football qualifying match in the city , where germany beat turkey 3-0 .
' no clear prospect ' for eu membership prior to his visit , erdogan accused the eu of failing to provide his country with a clear prospect of joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff was praised for his comments about islam the eu commission is finalizing its annual report on how turkey is progressing on eu requirements .
an impasse over cyprus , an eu member that turkey has refused to recognize , will be seen as the main outstanding problem .
a representative emnid survey conducted last week showed that 69 percent of germans oppose eu membership for turkey .
meanwhile , horst seehofer , the head of the conservative christian social union party and state premier of bavaria , has called for a restriction of immigration to germany from certain cultures .
seehofer told focus magazine that migrants from turkey and arab countries had a harder time integrating , and that those immigrants who refused to integrate must be dealt with more firmly .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the theme of muslim integration has been a hot topic lately both leaders pledged more to improve the integration of germany 's 2.5-million-strong turkish minority after the issue became a focus of public discussion .
following the meeting , merkel said germany should use the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between germany and turkey to take a look at the ongoing problems of integrating immigrant groups .
" we propose that everywhere in cities and towns where there are people of turkish origin , we use this event as a way of taking stock and seeing where we are and what has to be done , " merkel told reporters , adding that there were still problems to be addressed and that turkey was a willing and constructive partner .
" assimilation is not on our agenda , this is about integration , " merkel added , stressing that learning the german language was integral for the employment opportunities of young turks living in europe 's largest country .
wulff comments praised erdogan , meanwhile , said the integration of some 2 million turkish people living in germany was " very important , " and that both countries needed to take a closer look at what could be done to advance the process .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan stressed a need for a solid prospect of eu membership the turkish premier went on to welcome recent comments by german president christian wulff , who said on the 20th anniversary of german reunification on october 3 that islam was " now a part of germany . "
the integration debate in germany has flared in recent months after a central banker said germany was becoming " more stupid , " claiming immigrants from muslim nations are poorly educated and unproductive .
talks also focused on bilateral ties , the situation in turkey following september 's constitutional referendum , security issues and ankara 's eu membership bid .
erdogan told a joint news conference with merkel that turkey 's bid to enter the eu must not be allowed to slow , addressing concerns that some eu members are stalling entry of a muslim country to the club .
the two leaders met over breakfast in berlin after the previous night 's euro 2012 football qualifying match in the city , where germany beat turkey 3-0 .
' no clear prospect ' for eu membership prior to his visit , erdogan accused the eu of failing to provide his country with a clear prospect of joining the bloc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulff was praised for his comments about islam the eu commission is finalizing its annual report on how turkey is progressing on eu requirements .
an impasse over cyprus , an eu member that turkey has refused to recognize , will be seen as the main outstanding problem .
a representative emnid survey conducted last week showed that 69 percent of germans oppose eu membership for turkey .
meanwhile , horst seehofer , the head of the conservative christian social union party and state premier of bavaria , has called for a restriction of immigration to germany from certain cultures .
seehofer told focus magazine that migrants from turkey and arab countries had a harder time integrating , and that those immigrants who refused to integrate must be dealt with more firmly .

it has some oil and gas and a developing gold mining sector , but relies on imports for most of its energy needs .
resentment at widespread poverty and ethnic divisions between north and south occasionally spill over into violence , and the country 's first two post-soviet presidents were swept from power by popular discontent .
overview overview facts leaders media in 2005 , a popular revolt sparked by allegations of government interference in parliamentary elections and fuelled by poverty and corruption swept president askar akayev - who had led the country since independence - from power .
at-a-glance politics : first two post-soviet presidents , askar akayev and kurmanbek bakiyev , were swept from power by popular uprisings .
ethnic tensions have led to violence economics : kyrgyzstan is one of the poorest countries of the former soviet union international : kyrgyzstan hosts russian and us military airbases timeline kyrgyzstan 's democratic credentials were regarded as relatively strong in the immediate post-soviet era , but this reputation was lost when corruption and nepotism took hold during president akayev 's years in office .
parliamentary and presidential elections were flawed , opposition figures faced harassment and imprisonment , and opposition newspapers were closed .
his successor after the 2005 revolt , kurmanbek bakiyev , failed to restore full confidence in state institutions at home or abroad .
his time in office was marred by political instability and an almost constant struggle with parliament over the constitutional balance of power .
elections held under mr bakiyev were criticised as being undemocratic , and human rights groups expressed concern over the curtailing of civil liberties and attacks on the media .
civil tensions again came to a head in april 2010 , when mr bakiyev himself was toppled and an interim government was set up under the leadership of former foreign minister roza otunbayeva .
the kyrgyz make up nearly 70 % of the population , with uzbeks accounting for about 15 % and concentrated in the ferghana valley in the south .
russians have a significant presence in the north and in the capital , bishkek .
there is tension between the kyrgyz and uzbek communities in the south over land and housing , and relations with uzbekistan were strained following the flight of refugees into kyrgyzstan after clashes in the uzbek city andijan in 2005 .
there have been several serious outbreaks of kyrgyz-uzbek interethnic violence in the southern city of osh , notably in 1990 - when hundreds were killed - and again in june 2010 following the overthrow of kurmanbek bakiyev .
osh had been a bakiyev stronghold .
most of the population of kyrgyzstan is nominally muslim , and there has been a growing interest in islam among those seeking a new ethnic or national identity .
the government is worried about inroads by jihadist groups like hizb-ut tahrir , and there have been periodic outbreaks of fighting in the south .
kyrgyzstan also features in the us-russian rivalry for control of central asia , as both powers have military air bases in the country .
the us established an air base at the manas international airport near bishkek in late 2001 to support military operations in afghanistan .

it has some oil and gas and a developing gold mining sector , but relies on imports for most of its energy needs .
resentment at widespread poverty and ethnic divisions between north and south occasionally spill over into violence , and the country 's first two post-soviet presidents were swept from power by popular discontent .
overview overview facts leaders media in 2005 , a popular revolt sparked by allegations of government interference in parliamentary elections and fuelled by poverty and corruption swept president askar akayev - who had led the country since independence - from power .
at-a-glance politics : first two post-soviet presidents , askar akayev and kurmanbek bakiyev , were swept from power by popular uprisings .
ethnic tensions have led to violence economics : kyrgyzstan is one of the poorest countries of the former soviet union international : kyrgyzstan hosts russian and us military airbases timeline kyrgyzstan 's democratic credentials were regarded as relatively strong in the immediate post-soviet era , but this reputation was lost when corruption and nepotism took hold during president akayev 's years in office .
parliamentary and presidential elections were flawed , opposition figures faced harassment and imprisonment , and opposition newspapers were closed .
his successor after the 2005 revolt , kurmanbek bakiyev , failed to restore full confidence in state institutions at home or abroad .
his time in office was marred by political instability and an almost constant struggle with parliament over the constitutional balance of power .
elections held under mr bakiyev were criticised as being undemocratic , and human rights groups expressed concern over the curtailing of civil liberties and attacks on the media .
civil tensions again came to a head in april 2010 , when mr bakiyev himself was toppled and an interim government was set up under the leadership of former foreign minister roza otunbayeva .
the kyrgyz make up nearly 70 % of the population , with uzbeks accounting for about 15 % and concentrated in the ferghana valley in the south .
russians have a significant presence in the north and in the capital , bishkek .
there is tension between the kyrgyz and uzbek communities in the south over land and housing , and relations with uzbekistan were strained following the flight of refugees into kyrgyzstan after clashes in the uzbek city andijan in 2005 .
there have been several serious outbreaks of kyrgyz-uzbek interethnic violence in the southern city of osh , notably in 1990 - when hundreds were killed - and again in june 2010 following the overthrow of kurmanbek bakiyev .
osh had been a bakiyev stronghold .
most of the population of kyrgyzstan is nominally muslim , and there has been a growing interest in islam among those seeking a new ethnic or national identity .
the government is worried about inroads by jihadist groups like hizb-ut tahrir , and there have been periodic outbreaks of fighting in the south .
kyrgyzstan also features in the us-russian rivalry for control of central asia , as both powers have military air bases in the country .
the us established an air base at the manas international airport near bishkek in late 2001 to support military operations in afghanistan .
president bakiyev threatened to close it in october 2008 after agreeing to a russian loan .
he reversed the decision when the us agreed to more than triple its annual rent for the base .
weeks later kyrgyzstan tentatively agreed to allow russia to open a second military base on its territory , apparently expanding moscow 's military reach to balance the us presence .

it is one of europe 's largest travelling fairs and attracts 250,000 visitors every october .
this year , for only the second time in its history , the fair is running for five days , rather than four .
the last time it did this was in 1994 to celebrate 700 years of the event .
it is running from wednesday until sunday .
keith james , chairman of the showman 's guild , said : " with the -lsb- extra -rsb- sunday we 're trying to attract more families to the goose fair . "
the fair 's name is likely to have come from the hundreds of geese which were driven from lincolnshire to be sold in nottingham when the event started .
goose fair has not run continuously .
it was cancelled because of the plague in 1646 and again during the two world wars .
the fair was moved from its original site in market square to its current location at forest recreation ground in the 1920s .
there are more than 500 attractions to enjoy and fairground devotees from all over the country attend .
as showman john silcock said : " you 've got to see it to believe it ! "
but even goose fair has been hit by the economic downturn .
showman jimmy wheatley said : " unfortunately , like all small businesses , our expenses are gaining on the profits . "
jimmy , whose family has been running rides and stalls at goose fair since 1928 , added : " we 've had to put our prices up , accordingly .
as a consequence , goose fair is losing its appeal . "
the 2010 goose fair started at 1730 bst on wednesday , 6 october and finishes at 2100 bst on sunday , 10 october .
there is no admission fee but prices vary for the rides .

mountain ranges divide the deserts of the north from the swamps and rain forests of the south , and the river nile splits the country from east to west .
however , the country may split if the people in the south vote in a january 2011 referendum to separate and form the continent 's newest state .
the country has been beset by conflict .
two rounds of north-south civil war cost the lives of 1.5 million people , and a continuing conflict in the western region of darfur has driven two million people from their homes and killed more than 200,000 .
overview overview facts leaders media sudan 's centuries of association with egypt formally ended in 1956 , when joint british-egyptian rule over the country ended .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
independence was rapidly overshadowed by unresolved constitutional tensions with the south , which flared up into full-scale civil war that the coup-prone central government was ill-equipped to suppress .
the military-led government of president jaafar numeiri agreed to autonomy for the south in 1972 , but fighting broke out again in 1983 .
after two years of bargaining , the rebels signed a comprehensive peace deal with the government to end the civil war in january 2005 .
humanitarian crisis : civil war in darfur region is seen as " one of the worst nightmares in recent history " ; tribal clashes in south have been escalating politics : president omar bashir faces war crimes charges over darfur .
he heads a unity government formed after a peace deal ended 20 years of southern civil war .
tension rising in run-up to 2011 independence referendum in the south .
economy : oil production and revenues are rising timeline the accord provides for a high degree of autonomy for the south .
the region will also share oil revenue equally with the north .
in darfur , in western sudan , the united nations has accused pro-government arab militias of a campaign of ethnic cleansing against non-arab locals .
the conflict has strained relations between sudan and chad , to the west .
both countries have accused each other of cross-border incursions .
there have been fears that the darfur conflict could lead to a regional war .
decades of fighting have left sudan 's infrastructure in tatters .
with the return of millions of displaced southerners , there is a pressing need for reconstruction .
the economic dividends of peace could be great .
sudan has large areas of cultivatable land , as well as gold and cotton .
its oil reserves are ripe for further exploitation .
arabic is the official language and islam is the state religion , but the large non-arab , non-muslim minority has rejected attempts by the government in khartoum to impose islamic sharia law on the country as a whole .
president omar bashir has been locked in a power struggle with hassan al-turabi , his former mentor and the main ideologue of sudan 's islamist government .
since 2001 mr turabi has spent periods in detention and has been accused , but not tried , over an alleged coup plot .

omar al-bashir is wanted on genocide and war crimes charges he heads a government of national unity that includes leaders of southern sudan , which has limited autonomy and which has been promised the option of full independence in a referendum in 2011 .
the formation of the unity government in 2005 and the referendum were part of the comprehensive peace agreement to end the conflict in southern sudan , africa 's longest-running civil war .
mr bashir faces two international arrest warrants - issued by the international criminal court in the hague - on charges of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
the charges relate to the conflict in the western darfur , where thousands of people died of violence , disease and displacement during the fighting between government and rebel forces .
he has dismissed the allegations and has continued to travel to countries which oppose the indictment .
when he took power in the 1989 military coup against the elected government of prime minister sadiq al-mahdi he dissolved parliament , banned political parties and set up and chaired the revolutionary command council for national salvation , which ruled through a civilian government .
he formed an alliance with hassan al-turabi , the leader of the national lslamic front , who became the regime 's ideologue and is thought to be behind the introduction of islamic sharia law in the north in 1991 .
in 1993 mr bashir dissolved the revolutionary command for national salvation , concentrating power in his own hands .
mr bashir was elected president in 1996 .
a new constitution was drawn up and some opposition activity was permitted .
but in late 1999 mr bashir dissolved parliament and declared a state of emergency after mr turabi tried to give parliament the power to remove the president and to reinstate the post of prime minister .
president bashir won re-election in 2000 .
supporters of the national congress party filled the parliament .
the opposition boycotted the poll , accusing mr bashir of vote-rigging .
in april 2010 he won sudan 's first multi-party elections in 24 years .
international observers criticised the election as falling short of international standards .
many opposition parties withdrew from the race , alleging widespread vote rigging and intimidation .

a rebel since the late 1960s , mr kiir joined the sudanese army after the 1972 peace agreement .
he defected to the rebels on the resumption of fighting in 1983 and emerged as the military leader of the splm .
like mr garang he is a dinka , the largest ethnic group in the south .
unlike mr garang , salva kiir has consistently favoured full southern independence .
he remains very popular in the south , in particular among splm military veterans .
he was re-elected in multiparty polls which were held in the south in april 2010 , at the same times as the elections in the north in which president bashir was re-elected .

vice-president : ali osman taha a former first vice-president and foreign minister , ali osman taha was the chief government negotiator in the deal that ended the north-south civil war in 2005 .
he stepped down to allow john garang , and then salva kiir , to take up the first vice-presidency , and has served as second vice-president ever since .
a member of president omar bashir 's national congress party , he is seen as a loyalist who has undertaken extensive diplomatic missions to depend the government 's actions in darfur and to lobby against the international arrest warrant against the president .
media overview facts leaders media sudanese broadcasting is highly restricted .

the private press enjoys a greater degree of freedom than the state broadcasters and offers a limited forum for opposition views , but the state retains and uses powers to influence what is published .
pre-publication censorship of newspapers by the intelligence services was lifted in 2009 .
the move was linked to the signing of an " ethical code " by editors .
but after president bashir was re-elected in april 2010 , opposition and privately-owned papers said screening had made a comeback .
in the semi-autonomous south , the lack of infrastructure limits media operations .
however , broadcasters and newspapers , some with foreign funding , are active .
radio is the most-popular medium .
