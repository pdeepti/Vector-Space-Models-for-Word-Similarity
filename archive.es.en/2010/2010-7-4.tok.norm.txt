human rights groups continue to document military abuse against workers there . the controversy surrounding zimbabwe 's marange diamond fields could not be resolved at a conference of the un-backed kimberley process -lrb- kp -rrb- , which regulates the worldwide trade of conflict diamonds .
delegates at the recent kp meeting in tel aviv failed to reach a consensus on whether to allow zimbabwe to resume exporting marange diamonds .
the kp withdrew certification of the fields last november after its investigators documented forced labor , beatings and other abuses by the military against civilians working in the diamond fields .
human rights groups have called for zimbabwe to be suspended from the kp , saying it had not fulfilled its promise made last year to improve conditions at its marange fields .
" the controversial marange diamond fields have seen and continue to see quite a high level of human rights abuses and the militarization of mining , " annie dunnebacke , a campaigner at the non-governmental organization global witness , told deutsche welle .
global witness focuses its work on natural-resource related conflicts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small percentage of these raw diamonds are of gem quality a report by kp investigator abbey chikane presented at the tel aviv conference argued that president robert mugabe 's government had met the regulator 's criteria in respect to the marange diamond fields .
but human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- has received new reports that soldiers are engaging in forced labor , torture , beatings and harassment in the marange diamond fields around chiadzwa , 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- east of the zimbabwean capital harare .
" it baffles us why chikane would say exportation should go ahead because there 's still smuggling in the fields , and the army has not been removed , " said tiseke kasambala , senior researcher in hrw 's africa division .
" we are still seeing forced labor , beatings and torture , and the sexual assault of women , " kasambala told deutsche welle .
" that is something that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency by the government of zimbabwe and by the kp . "
africa 's role the european union in a statement urged members of the certification scheme to put greater pressure on zimbabwe to improve the situation of mine workers to meet the minimum standards set out by the kp .
it followed on the heels of a us appeal .
philip crowley , a spokesman for the us state department , said that washington was " disappointed " that consensus was not reached in tel aviv .
" it is important that zimbabwe address the ongoing diamond smuggling and human rights violations in and around the marange diamond fields , " crowley told reporters .
bildunterschrift : women in the marange fields are often victims of violence and abuse by the security forces but while every participant involved in the kp had a role to play in urging the government to take its responsibilities seriously , it was zimbabwe 's neighboring countries which could have the most clout , dunnebacke said .
" other african nations , including south africa , have an extremely important role to play in pushing the authorities in zimbabwe toward compliance , " she said .
" the kimberley process is incredibly important for all african diamond-producing countries . "
the certification scheme had helped to bring more official diamond revenues to countries such as the democratic republic of congo and angola , as well as reduce smuggling , she said .
" it has given international credibility and legitimacy to the diamond trade , " dunnebacke said .
" it would be terrible for these african countries if the kimberley process was compromised and it 's up to those governments to put pressure on zimbabwe and to say , look , cut it out .
you 've got to play by the rules like the rest of us are trying to do . "
kasambala , however , said she felt the only remaining avenue to put pressure on the government of zimbabwe was the kp itself .
key governments within the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- , such as south africa , could exert great pressure .
but it was more concerned with zimbabwe as a whole .
south africa had been instrumental in helping establish a fragile power-sharing government between president robert mugabe and opposition politician morgan tsvangirai , now prime minister , of the movement for democratic change .
" sadc governments are more interested in the bigger picture and not necessarily in what 's going on in the marange diamond fields , " kasambala said .
" so the kp seems to be the sole organization that can put political pressure on the government of zimbabwe to improve the situation there . "
exports to go ahead the zimbabwean government does not appear to be feeling any pressure , though .
according to the state-controlled daily newspaper , the herald , the government has said it will immediately begin selling marange diamonds on the international market .
zimbabwe 's minister of mines obert mpofu had already made this intention clear at the meeting in tel aviv .
mpofu had also belittled the role of ngos in the kp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blood diamonds from zimbabwe continue to find their way into jewelry stores worldwide " the attitude the zimbabwean authorities have shown to the kimberley process over the past 18 months has been difficult - to put it mildly , " said dunnebacke , who attended the kp conference .
" we have n't always seen a high level of commitment or interest in respecting the rules and being compliant with kimberley process requirements . "
however , zimbabwe may have difficulties finding legal buyers for the gems until the kp reaches a consensus .
its 49 members , representing 75 countries , have agreed to only buy diamonds certified as " conflict-free . "
securing political power human rights organizations are now concerned that mugabe and his powerful party zanu-pf could use the funds from the fields to tighten their grip on power .
" the security forces that have been committing abuses in the marange diamond fields answer to zanu-pf , " said kasambala , who also attended the kp conference .
" a key arm of this government of national unity is benefitting from smuggling in those diamond fields and is likely to use the revenue to commit further abuses , perhaps even during the next elections in zimbabwe .
that is what we 're warning about . "
the marange fields are regarded as the wealthiest diamond find in the world in a century .
the potential revenue for zimbabwe from the area is estimated to run at $ 1 billion -lrb- 0.8 billion euros -rrb- to $ 1.7 billion per year .
" there is very much concern that revenues from marange are not going into state coffers , toward the unity government or development , but are going toward certain elite within the zanu-pf and could be used for political violence at some point in the near future , " dunnebacke said .
the detention of a prominent human rights activist at the beginning of june illustrates the importance of this new-found wealth for the zanu-pf .
authorities arrested farai maguwu , the director of the center for research and development in eastern zimbabwe , after he met with chikane and briefed him on the human rights violations in the marange mines .
" essentially he 's in prison because his ngo has been documenting and reporting on the abuses in the marange diamond fields , " dunnebacke said .
though human rights groups , the eu and the us have condemned maguwu 's arrest , zimbabwean authorities refuse to release him on bail .
kp talks are due to resume on july 14 and 15 in st. petersburg , russia .

over three million voters participated in the southern german state 's sixth referendum , with 61 percent voting in favor of the ban , according to the director of state elections .
the citizens ' initiative " for real protection of non-smokers " will impose a total smoking ban on all clubs , bars , restaurants , cafes and beer tents .
the muenchner merkur newspaper on sunday called the vote a " landmark and surprisingly clear " decision .
" few german citizens had trusted the bavarians , often ridiculed as provincial , to show such decisiveness , " the paper said .
emotive issue the referendum was prompted by a heated debate in bavaria , pitting bar owners and restaurant associations against anti-smoking campaigners .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , bavaria 's governing party , had introduced germany 's strongest smoking ban at the beginning of 2008 . but the rules were relaxed a few months later , when the csu formed a state coalition with the free democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's premier seehofer gave up smoking at his wife 's request smoking is currently tolerated in small pubs and side-rooms of taverns , as well as in the oktoberfest 's famed beer tents .
the initiative to restore the original ban was backed by the green party and the social democrats .
the new legislation mandates that smoking will be outlawed in all public buildings beginning august 1 .
the rules will also apply to the oktoberfest , but officials have said that the ban will not be enforced there this year .
bavarian premier horst seehofer told daily tabloid bild preceding the referendum that his ruling csu party could live with either possible result of the referendum .
seehofer told the newspaper that he himself had given up social smoking at his wife 's request .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 04.07.2010 germany dealt post-match praise after dismantling argentina großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soccer fans across germany celebrated their team 's win from ordinary fans right up to the country 's leader , germans everywhere have heaped praise on their national football team after it ran riot against diego maradona 's argentina in their world cup quarterfinal clash . germany 's 4-0 demolition of argentina in their world cup quarterfinals clash was a sign of the team 's " class , " according to coach joachim loew following a win that sent germans everywhere into raptures .
following the full-time whistle , germans ran onto the streets in joy and embraced one another after watching their team roll over an underdone argentina .
others formed up motorcades to tour their cities , waving flags from car windows and honking horns .
joachim loew said there was now real belief his young team could go on to win the trophy for the first time in 20 years .
" we really turned in an incredible showing .
scoring four goals against argentina you just have to say that that was class .
and we closed down -lrb- lionel -rrb- messi very well - without resorting to fouls , so that was great , " said loew .
loew 's men tore apart diego maradona 's argentina , with long-serving striker miroslav klose scoring a brace , center-back arne friedrich enjoying a tap-in and 20-year-old thomas mueller heading in his fourth of the tournament .
the only downside of the game for the germans was that mueller picked up a yellow card late in the first half , meaning he will now miss germany 's semifinal clash with spain on wednesday .
loew said the bayern munich man would be sorely missed .
" the fact that we wo n't have mueller in the semifinal is a serious blow as over the past few matches he has shown how dangerous he is , " loew said .
" i really do n't see why he got booked .
the ball touches his thigh , then touches his arm from a really short distance . "
bildunterschrift : merkel , center-right , said watching the game was ' overwhelming ' spirited performance germany vice captain bastian schweinsteiger , who played an integral role in the quarterfinal win , applauded his teammates for their collective performance .
" we played very well .
i am very proud of the team , " he said .
" the early goal was decisive for us .
we are strong enough to go further .
the team is very young , but what we lack in experience we make up for in audacity and a carefree approach . "
among the 64,000 packed into green point stadium in cape town to cheer on the germans was the country 's leader , chancellor angela merkel , who paid a post-match visit to the players in their dressing room .
mueller said that merkel had told the team that the game had been wonderful .
" she said that she was shivering and shaking with excitement and it was only after the second and third goal that she started to relax and she then turned to south african president jacob zuma , next to whom she was sitting , and said that germany was going to win , " mueller said .
merkel called the victory " overwhelming " and " a dream . "
speaking to zdf television from cape town , merkel said that " germany has done something wonderful today , " adding that " it was overwhelming .
this is a dream , just a dream .
this is a young team but the way they played was very good .
they did n't give argentina much space . "
end of maradona experiment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speculation is now rife that maradona will step down from his post much speculation in argentina will now focus on the post-world cup future of diego maradona , who hinted strongly after the loss to germany that he would now quit as head coach .
" i 'm going to be 50 on october 30th , and this is the hardest thing i 've had to go through because i 'm in front of so many good players and good people , " he said at the post-match press conference .
" it 's like a knock-out punch from muhammad ali , and i do n't have the strength to do anything .
it was n't the ending we 'd hoped for , but i believe that whoever comes in next will have to continue on the same path because it 's the path the argentines want . "
meanwhile , the argentine press focused their attention on germany 's " steamroller " performance .
" germany laid bare all the deficiencies of the argentine side which , with neither carlos tevez , messi or -lrb- gonzalo -rrb- higuain at their best , had no answers in the face of adversity , " wrote la nacion daily .
" argentina had a bad time of it and left the world cup stage on the end of a thrashing from a german steamroller , " was the assessment of the infobae news website .
the daily clarin argued that lionel messi had not been used properly and was played too deep .
" he hung back too much for the ball to reach him .
he had a few bursts , which gave hope , yet the germans had him in their grip pretty much throughout .
he left the tournament without exploding into life or scoring any goals , " was the paper 's assessment .

following the full-time whistle , germans ran onto the streets in joy and embraced one another after watching their team roll over an underdone argentina .
others formed up motorcades to tour their cities , waving flags from car windows and honking horns .
joachim loew said there was now real belief his young team could go on to win the trophy for the first time in 20 years .
" we really turned in an incredible showing .
scoring four goals against argentina you just have to say that that was class .
and we closed down -lrb- lionel -rrb- messi very well - without resorting to fouls , so that was great , " said loew .
loew 's men tore apart diego maradona 's argentina , with long-serving striker miroslav klose scoring a brace , center-back arne friedrich enjoying a tap-in and 20-year-old thomas mueller heading in his fourth of the tournament .
the only downside of the game for the germans was that mueller picked up a yellow card late in the first half , meaning he will now miss germany 's semifinal clash with spain on wednesday .
loew said the bayern munich man would be sorely missed .
" the fact that we wo n't have mueller in the semifinal is a serious blow as over the past few matches he has shown how dangerous he is , " loew said .
" i really do n't see why he got booked .
the ball touches his thigh , then touches his arm from a really short distance . "
bildunterschrift : merkel , center-right , said watching the game was ' overwhelming ' spirited performance germany vice captain bastian schweinsteiger , who played an integral role in the quarterfinal win , applauded his teammates for their collective performance .
" we played very well .
i am very proud of the team , " he said .
" the early goal was decisive for us .
we are strong enough to go further .
the team is very young , but what we lack in experience we make up for in audacity and a carefree approach . "
among the 64,000 packed into green point stadium in cape town to cheer on the germans was the country 's leader , chancellor angela merkel , who paid a post-match visit to the players in their dressing room .
mueller said that merkel had told the team that the game had been wonderful .
" she said that she was shivering and shaking with excitement and it was only after the second and third goal that she started to relax and she then turned to south african president jacob zuma , next to whom she was sitting , and said that germany was going to win , " mueller said .
merkel called the victory " overwhelming " and " a dream . "
speaking to zdf television from cape town , merkel said that " germany has done something wonderful today , " adding that " it was overwhelming .
this is a dream , just a dream .
this is a young team but the way they played was very good .
they did n't give argentina much space . "
end of maradona experiment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speculation is now rife that maradona will step down from his post much speculation in argentina will now focus on the post-world cup future of diego maradona , who hinted strongly after the loss to germany that he would now quit as head coach .
" i 'm going to be 50 on october 30th , and this is the hardest thing i 've had to go through because i 'm in front of so many good players and good people , " he said at the post-match press conference .
" it 's like a knock-out punch from muhammad ali , and i do n't have the strength to do anything .
it was n't the ending we 'd hoped for , but i believe that whoever comes in next will have to continue on the same path because it 's the path the argentines want . "
meanwhile , the argentine press focused their attention on germany 's " steamroller " performance .
" germany laid bare all the deficiencies of the argentine side which , with neither carlos tevez , messi or -lrb- gonzalo -rrb- higuain at their best , had no answers in the face of adversity , " wrote la nacion daily .
" argentina had a bad time of it and left the world cup stage on the end of a thrashing from a german steamroller , " was the assessment of the infobae news website .
the daily clarin argued that lionel messi had not been used properly and was played too deep .
" he hung back too much for the ball to reach him .
he had a few bursts , which gave hope , yet the germans had him in their grip pretty much throughout .
he left the tournament without exploding into life or scoring any goals , " was the paper 's assessment .

so why is he suddenly having such a terrific world cup ?
ironically , being out of the spotlight has helped him shine . it may have taken 77 games , but he finally got one .
thirty-one-year-old central defender arne friedrich finally grabbed his first ever goal in german national dress in his side 's surprise 4-0 thrashing of argentina on saturday .
more importantly , though , he anchored a back-four that kept messi , tevez and higuain thoroughly at bay , not allowing the gauchos a single quality look at manuel neuer 's goal .
what 's more , he 's helped germany 's other interior defender , per mertesacker , get through some noticeable wobbles at the start of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : friedrich has picked up the slack for mertesacker " i spoke to him briefly after he came in for criticism , " friedrich said in an interview with the online edition of the german weekly die zeit .
" i told him that i could write a novel about criticism and that i would always be standing beside him on the pitch . "
if anyone had said two weeks ago that friedrich would have been joachim loew 's rock at the back , that person would probably have been put on prescription medications .
as germany headed to south africa , the defender 's place in germany 's starting eleven was anything but sure , and friedrich himself had just been relegated with his former club hertha berlin .
but as friedrich himself has said , not playing for hertha is one key to his renaissance .
bildunterschrift : a dream world cup has followed hertha 's nightmare season the defender , whose manner is usually guarded , has had a lot to say to the german press in the past week .
and the leitmotif has been liberation .
friedrich , the not-so-great " the pressure that i had on me the whole year completely fell away , and i became very relaxed , " friedrich told the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper when asked what it was like coming from relegated hertha to the national team .
after challenging for the bundesliga title in 2008-2009 , hertha plummeted to the bottom of the table early on last season and stayed there .
the inevitable squabbling commenced , and friedrich as captain was able neither to bring the team together nor perform up to speed on the pitch .
friedrich has since transferred to 2008-9 champions wolfsburg .
but the sight of the highly-paid veteran getting nutmegged in front of his own goal became all-too-familiar for hertha devotees .
" i had a very difficult year and played badly in the first half of the season , " friedrich acknowledged in the stadt-anzeiger .
" then i performed better , and we still went down .
as the captain , i was under extreme pressure , and i , too , made mistakes . "
rumors also persist that friedrich was part of a cabal that led to ex-hertha-coach lucien favre getting fired - something friedrich angrily denies .
and that is n't the only bad press that gets friedrich 's gander up .
bildunterschrift : germany 's number 3 was more than a match for stars like tevez although he 's been a fixture in the german national side since 2002 , friedrich has never gotten much love from either fans or the press .
" in 2006 , i also had to take a lot of criticism , " friedrich told die zeit .
" people wrote that i had never been a positive player .
i was never considered a savior , and people said i was just along for the ride … it really ticked me off when people wrote things that were n't true . "
but there was - and is - an element of truth in what was written .
while friedrich is certainly not just along for the ride , he is anything but a natural-born leader .
ahead of the argentina game , while most of the team joked around on the balcony of their hotel in cape town , friedrich was filmed walking alone on the beach staring at the waves .
he himself says he 's not a buddy-buddy sort of player .
" true friendships are very rare in football , " he told die zeit .
that 's about as personal a statement as any journalist is likely to get from the articulate , but wary defender .
and it may explain why , although friedrich is one of only two long-time veterans in the squad , coach joachim loew chose ever-cheerful philipp lahm as his captain and extroverted bastian schweinsteiger as his " on-field leader . "
conversely , friedrich seems to have benefited from being out of the focus - and able to breathe a bit easier .
" unfortunately , i ca n't do anything to change the facts and keep hertha in the first division , " friedrich told die zeit .
" when i joined up again with the national team , it was like a liberation . "
freed from any responsibilities larger than keeping a tight ship at the back , friedrich has turned in five fine performances - more than most defenders in south africa can say .
he 's even finally gotten that elusive first goal for the national team .
and he may even get a first world cup title to cap off his unlikely comeback .

ironically , being out of the spotlight has helped him shine . it may have taken 77 games , but he finally got one .
thirty-one-year-old central defender arne friedrich finally grabbed his first ever goal in german national dress in his side 's surprise 4-0 thrashing of argentina on saturday .
more importantly , though , he anchored a back-four that kept messi , tevez and higuain thoroughly at bay , not allowing the gauchos a single quality look at manuel neuer 's goal .
what 's more , he 's helped germany 's other interior defender , per mertesacker , get through some noticeable wobbles at the start of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : friedrich has picked up the slack for mertesacker " i spoke to him briefly after he came in for criticism , " friedrich said in an interview with the online edition of the german weekly die zeit .

if anyone had said two weeks ago that friedrich would have been joachim loew 's rock at the back , that person would probably have been put on prescription medications .
as germany headed to south africa , the defender 's place in germany 's starting eleven was anything but sure , and friedrich himself had just been relegated with his former club hertha berlin .

following the full-time whistle , germans ran onto the streets in joy and embraced one another after watching their team roll over an underdone argentina .
others formed up motorcades to tour their cities , waving flags from car windows and honking horns .
joachim loew said there was now real belief his young team could go on to win the trophy for the first time in 20 years .
" we really turned in an incredible showing .
scoring four goals against argentina you just have to say that that was class .
and we closed down -lrb- lionel -rrb- messi very well - without resorting to fouls , so that was great , " said loew .
loew 's men tore apart diego maradona 's argentina , with long-serving striker miroslav klose scoring a brace , center-back arne friedrich enjoying a tap-in and 20-year-old thomas mueller heading in his fourth of the tournament .
the only downside of the game for the germans was that mueller picked up a yellow card late in the first half , meaning he will now miss germany 's semifinal clash with spain on wednesday .
loew said the bayern munich man would be sorely missed .
" the fact that we wo n't have mueller in the semifinal is a serious blow as over the past few matches he has shown how dangerous he is , " loew said .
" i really do n't see why he got booked .
the ball touches his thigh , then touches his arm from a really short distance . "
bildunterschrift : merkel , center-right , said watching the game was ' overwhelming ' spirited performance germany vice captain bastian schweinsteiger , who played an integral role in the quarterfinal win , applauded his teammates for their collective performance .
" we played very well .
i am very proud of the team , " he said .
" the early goal was decisive for us .
we are strong enough to go further .
the team is very young , but what we lack in experience we make up for in audacity and a carefree approach . "
among the 64,000 packed into green point stadium in cape town to cheer on the germans was the country 's leader , chancellor angela merkel , who paid a post-match visit to the players in their dressing room .
mueller said that merkel had told the team that the game had been wonderful .
" she said that she was shivering and shaking with excitement and it was only after the second and third goal that she started to relax and she then turned to south african president jacob zuma , next to whom she was sitting , and said that germany was going to win , " mueller said .
merkel called the victory " overwhelming " and " a dream . "
speaking to zdf television from cape town , merkel said that " germany has done something wonderful today , " adding that " it was overwhelming .
this is a dream , just a dream .
this is a young team but the way they played was very good .
they did n't give argentina much space . "
end of maradona experiment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speculation is now rife that maradona will step down from his post much speculation in argentina will now focus on the post-world cup future of diego maradona , who hinted strongly after the loss to germany that he would now quit as head coach .
" i 'm going to be 50 on october 30th , and this is the hardest thing i 've had to go through because i 'm in front of so many good players and good people , " he said at the post-match press conference .
" it 's like a knock-out punch from muhammad ali , and i do n't have the strength to do anything .
it was n't the ending we 'd hoped for , but i believe that whoever comes in next will have to continue on the same path because it 's the path the argentines want . "
meanwhile , the argentine press focused their attention on germany 's " steamroller " performance .
" germany laid bare all the deficiencies of the argentine side which , with neither carlos tevez , messi or -lrb- gonzalo -rrb- higuain at their best , had no answers in the face of adversity , " wrote la nacion daily .
" argentina had a bad time of it and left the world cup stage on the end of a thrashing from a german steamroller , " was the assessment of the infobae news website .
the daily clarin argued that lionel messi had not been used properly and was played too deep .
" he hung back too much for the ball to reach him .
he had a few bursts , which gave hope , yet the germans had him in their grip pretty much throughout .
he left the tournament without exploding into life or scoring any goals , " was the paper 's assessment .

so why is he suddenly having such a terrific world cup ?
ironically , being out of the spotlight has helped him shine . it may have taken 77 games , but he finally got one .
thirty-one-year-old central defender arne friedrich finally grabbed his first ever goal in german national dress in his side 's surprise 4-0 thrashing of argentina on saturday .
more importantly , though , he anchored a back-four that kept messi , tevez and higuain thoroughly at bay , not allowing the gauchos a single quality look at manuel neuer 's goal .
what 's more , he 's helped germany 's other interior defender , per mertesacker , get through some noticeable wobbles at the start of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : friedrich has picked up the slack for mertesacker " i spoke to him briefly after he came in for criticism , " friedrich said in an interview with the online edition of the german weekly die zeit .
" i told him that i could write a novel about criticism and that i would always be standing beside him on the pitch . "
if anyone had said two weeks ago that friedrich would have been joachim loew 's rock at the back , that person would probably have been put on prescription medications .
as germany headed to south africa , the defender 's place in germany 's starting eleven was anything but sure , and friedrich himself had just been relegated with his former club hertha berlin .
but as friedrich himself has said , not playing for hertha is one key to his renaissance .
bildunterschrift : a dream world cup has followed hertha 's nightmare season the defender , whose manner is usually guarded , has had a lot to say to the german press in the past week .
and the leitmotif has been liberation .
friedrich , the not-so-great " the pressure that i had on me the whole year completely fell away , and i became very relaxed , " friedrich told the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper when asked what it was like coming from relegated hertha to the national team .
after challenging for the bundesliga title in 2008-2009 , hertha plummeted to the bottom of the table early on last season and stayed there .
the inevitable squabbling commenced , and friedrich as captain was able neither to bring the team together nor perform up to speed on the pitch .
friedrich has since transferred to 2008-9 champions wolfsburg .
but the sight of the highly-paid veteran getting nutmegged in front of his own goal became all-too-familiar for hertha devotees .
" i had a very difficult year and played badly in the first half of the season , " friedrich acknowledged in the stadt-anzeiger .
" then i performed better , and we still went down .
as the captain , i was under extreme pressure , and i , too , made mistakes . "
rumors also persist that friedrich was part of a cabal that led to ex-hertha-coach lucien favre getting fired - something friedrich angrily denies .
and that is n't the only bad press that gets friedrich 's gander up .
bildunterschrift : germany 's number 3 was more than a match for stars like tevez although he 's been a fixture in the german national side since 2002 , friedrich has never gotten much love from either fans or the press .
" in 2006 , i also had to take a lot of criticism , " friedrich told die zeit .
" people wrote that i had never been a positive player .
i was never considered a savior , and people said i was just along for the ride … it really ticked me off when people wrote things that were n't true . "
but there was - and is - an element of truth in what was written .
while friedrich is certainly not just along for the ride , he is anything but a natural-born leader .
ahead of the argentina game , while most of the team joked around on the balcony of their hotel in cape town , friedrich was filmed walking alone on the beach staring at the waves .
he himself says he 's not a buddy-buddy sort of player .
" true friendships are very rare in football , " he told die zeit .
that 's about as personal a statement as any journalist is likely to get from the articulate , but wary defender .
and it may explain why , although friedrich is one of only two long-time veterans in the squad , coach joachim loew chose ever-cheerful philipp lahm as his captain and extroverted bastian schweinsteiger as his " on-field leader . "
conversely , friedrich seems to have benefited from being out of the focus - and able to breathe a bit easier .
" unfortunately , i ca n't do anything to change the facts and keep hertha in the first division , " friedrich told die zeit .
" when i joined up again with the national team , it was like a liberation . "
freed from any responsibilities larger than keeping a tight ship at the back , friedrich has turned in five fine performances - more than most defenders in south africa can say .
he 's even finally gotten that elusive first goal for the national team .
and he may even get a first world cup title to cap off his unlikely comeback .

" bavaria became the first german state on sunday to endorse a total smoking ban following a referendum putting an end to smoking in all public buildings .
over three million voters participated in the southern german state 's sixth referendum , with 61 percent voting in favor of the ban , according to the director of state elections .
the citizens ' initiative " for real protection of non-smokers " will impose a total smoking ban on all clubs , bars , restaurants , cafes and beer tents .
the muenchner merkur newspaper on sunday called the vote a " landmark and surprisingly clear " decision .
" few german citizens had trusted the bavarians , often ridiculed as provincial , to show such decisiveness , " the paper said .
emotive issue the referendum was prompted by a heated debate in bavaria , pitting bar owners and restaurant associations against anti-smoking campaigners .

the new legislation mandates that smoking will be outlawed in all public buildings beginning august 1 .
the rules will also apply to the oktoberfest , but officials have said that the ban will not be enforced there this year .
bavarian premier horst seehofer told daily tabloid bild preceding the referendum that his ruling csu party could live with either possible result of the referendum .
seehofer told the newspaper that he himself had given up social smoking at his wife 's request .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 04.07.2010 zimbabwe urged to improve standards in diamond mines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the diamonds in the marange fields could bring zimbabwe up to $ 1.7 billion in revenue a year both the eu and the us have called on zimbabwe to intensify efforts to improve conditions in the african nation 's marange diamond mines .
human rights groups continue to document military abuse against workers there . the controversy surrounding zimbabwe 's marange diamond fields could not be resolved at a conference of the un-backed kimberley process -lrb- kp -rrb- , which regulates the worldwide trade of conflict diamonds .
delegates at the recent kp meeting in tel aviv failed to reach a consensus on whether to allow zimbabwe to resume exporting marange diamonds .
the kp withdrew certification of the fields last november after its investigators documented forced labor , beatings and other abuses by the military against civilians working in the diamond fields .
human rights groups have called for zimbabwe to be suspended from the kp , saying it had not fulfilled its promise made last year to improve conditions at its marange fields .
" the controversial marange diamond fields have seen and continue to see quite a high level of human rights abuses and the militarization of mining , " annie dunnebacke , a campaigner at the non-governmental organization global witness , told deutsche welle .
global witness focuses its work on natural-resource related conflicts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small percentage of these raw diamonds are of gem quality a report by kp investigator abbey chikane presented at the tel aviv conference argued that president robert mugabe 's government had met the regulator 's criteria in respect to the marange diamond fields .
but human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- has received new reports that soldiers are engaging in forced labor , torture , beatings and harassment in the marange diamond fields around chiadzwa , 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- east of the zimbabwean capital harare .
" it baffles us why chikane would say exportation should go ahead because there 's still smuggling in the fields , and the army has not been removed , " said tiseke kasambala , senior researcher in hrw 's africa division .
" we are still seeing forced labor , beatings and torture , and the sexual assault of women , " kasambala told deutsche welle .
" that is something that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency by the government of zimbabwe and by the kp . "
africa 's role the european union in a statement urged members of the certification scheme to put greater pressure on zimbabwe to improve the situation of mine workers to meet the minimum standards set out by the kp .
it followed on the heels of a us appeal .
philip crowley , a spokesman for the us state department , said that washington was " disappointed " that consensus was not reached in tel aviv .
" it is important that zimbabwe address the ongoing diamond smuggling and human rights violations in and around the marange diamond fields , " crowley told reporters .
bildunterschrift : women in the marange fields are often victims of violence and abuse by the security forces but while every participant involved in the kp had a role to play in urging the government to take its responsibilities seriously , it was zimbabwe 's neighboring countries which could have the most clout , dunnebacke said .
" other african nations , including south africa , have an extremely important role to play in pushing the authorities in zimbabwe toward compliance , " she said .
" the kimberley process is incredibly important for all african diamond-producing countries . "
the certification scheme had helped to bring more official diamond revenues to countries such as the democratic republic of congo and angola , as well as reduce smuggling , she said .
" it has given international credibility and legitimacy to the diamond trade , " dunnebacke said .
" it would be terrible for these african countries if the kimberley process was compromised and it 's up to those governments to put pressure on zimbabwe and to say , look , cut it out .
you 've got to play by the rules like the rest of us are trying to do . "
kasambala , however , said she felt the only remaining avenue to put pressure on the government of zimbabwe was the kp itself .
key governments within the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- , such as south africa , could exert great pressure .
but it was more concerned with zimbabwe as a whole .
south africa had been instrumental in helping establish a fragile power-sharing government between president robert mugabe and opposition politician morgan tsvangirai , now prime minister , of the movement for democratic change .
" sadc governments are more interested in the bigger picture and not necessarily in what 's going on in the marange diamond fields , " kasambala said .
" so the kp seems to be the sole organization that can put political pressure on the government of zimbabwe to improve the situation there . "
exports to go ahead the zimbabwean government does not appear to be feeling any pressure , though .
according to the state-controlled daily newspaper , the herald , the government has said it will immediately begin selling marange diamonds on the international market .
zimbabwe 's minister of mines obert mpofu had already made this intention clear at the meeting in tel aviv .
mpofu had also belittled the role of ngos in the kp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blood diamonds from zimbabwe continue to find their way into jewelry stores worldwide " the attitude the zimbabwean authorities have shown to the kimberley process over the past 18 months has been difficult - to put it mildly , " said dunnebacke , who attended the kp conference .
" we have n't always seen a high level of commitment or interest in respecting the rules and being compliant with kimberley process requirements . "
however , zimbabwe may have difficulties finding legal buyers for the gems until the kp reaches a consensus .
its 49 members , representing 75 countries , have agreed to only buy diamonds certified as " conflict-free . "
securing political power human rights organizations are now concerned that mugabe and his powerful party zanu-pf could use the funds from the fields to tighten their grip on power .
" the security forces that have been committing abuses in the marange diamond fields answer to zanu-pf , " said kasambala , who also attended the kp conference .
" a key arm of this government of national unity is benefitting from smuggling in those diamond fields and is likely to use the revenue to commit further abuses , perhaps even during the next elections in zimbabwe .
that is what we 're warning about . "
the marange fields are regarded as the wealthiest diamond find in the world in a century .
the potential revenue for zimbabwe from the area is estimated to run at $ 1 billion -lrb- 0.8 billion euros -rrb- to $ 1.7 billion per year .
" there is very much concern that revenues from marange are not going into state coffers , toward the unity government or development , but are going toward certain elite within the zanu-pf and could be used for political violence at some point in the near future , " dunnebacke said .
the detention of a prominent human rights activist at the beginning of june illustrates the importance of this new-found wealth for the zanu-pf .
authorities arrested farai maguwu , the director of the center for research and development in eastern zimbabwe , after he met with chikane and briefed him on the human rights violations in the marange mines .
" essentially he 's in prison because his ngo has been documenting and reporting on the abuses in the marange diamond fields , " dunnebacke said .
though human rights groups , the eu and the us have condemned maguwu 's arrest , zimbabwean authorities refuse to release him on bail .
kp talks are due to resume on july 14 and 15 in st. petersburg , russia .

following the full-time whistle , germans ran onto the streets in joy and embraced one another after watching their team roll over an underdone argentina .
others formed up motorcades to tour their cities , waving flags from car windows and honking horns .
joachim loew said there was now real belief his young team could go on to win the trophy for the first time in 20 years .
" we really turned in an incredible showing .
scoring four goals against argentina you just have to say that that was class .
and we closed down -lrb- lionel -rrb- messi very well - without resorting to fouls , so that was great , " said loew .
loew 's men tore apart diego maradona 's argentina , with long-serving striker miroslav klose scoring a brace , center-back arne friedrich enjoying a tap-in and 20-year-old thomas mueller heading in his fourth of the tournament .
the only downside of the game for the germans was that mueller picked up a yellow card late in the first half , meaning he will now miss germany 's semifinal clash with spain on wednesday .
loew said the bayern munich man would be sorely missed .
" the fact that we wo n't have mueller in the semifinal is a serious blow as over the past few matches he has shown how dangerous he is , " loew said .
" i really do n't see why he got booked .
the ball touches his thigh , then touches his arm from a really short distance . "
bildunterschrift : merkel , center-right , said watching the game was ' overwhelming ' spirited performance germany vice captain bastian schweinsteiger , who played an integral role in the quarterfinal win , applauded his teammates for their collective performance .
" we played very well .
i am very proud of the team , " he said .
" the early goal was decisive for us .
we are strong enough to go further .
the team is very young , but what we lack in experience we make up for in audacity and a carefree approach . "
among the 64,000 packed into green point stadium in cape town to cheer on the germans was the country 's leader , chancellor angela merkel , who paid a post-match visit to the players in their dressing room .
mueller said that merkel had told the team that the game had been wonderful .
" she said that she was shivering and shaking with excitement and it was only after the second and third goal that she started to relax and she then turned to south african president jacob zuma , next to whom she was sitting , and said that germany was going to win , " mueller said .
merkel called the victory " overwhelming " and " a dream . "
speaking to zdf television from cape town , merkel said that " germany has done something wonderful today , " adding that " it was overwhelming .
this is a dream , just a dream .
this is a young team but the way they played was very good .
they did n't give argentina much space . "
end of maradona experiment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speculation is now rife that maradona will step down from his post much speculation in argentina will now focus on the post-world cup future of diego maradona , who hinted strongly after the loss to germany that he would now quit as head coach .
" i 'm going to be 50 on october 30th , and this is the hardest thing i 've had to go through because i 'm in front of so many good players and good people , " he said at the post-match press conference .
" it 's like a knock-out punch from muhammad ali , and i do n't have the strength to do anything .
it was n't the ending we 'd hoped for , but i believe that whoever comes in next will have to continue on the same path because it 's the path the argentines want . "
meanwhile , the argentine press focused their attention on germany 's " steamroller " performance .
" germany laid bare all the deficiencies of the argentine side which , with neither carlos tevez , messi or -lrb- gonzalo -rrb- higuain at their best , had no answers in the face of adversity , " wrote la nacion daily .
" argentina had a bad time of it and left the world cup stage on the end of a thrashing from a german steamroller , " was the assessment of the infobae news website .
the daily clarin argued that lionel messi had not been used properly and was played too deep .
" he hung back too much for the ball to reach him .
he had a few bursts , which gave hope , yet the germans had him in their grip pretty much throughout .
he left the tournament without exploding into life or scoring any goals , " was the paper 's assessment .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small percentage of these raw diamonds are of gem quality a report by kp investigator abbey chikane presented at the tel aviv conference argued that president robert mugabe 's government had met the regulator 's criteria in respect to the marange diamond fields .
but human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- has received new reports that soldiers are engaging in forced labor , torture , beatings and harassment in the marange diamond fields around chiadzwa , 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- east of the zimbabwean capital harare .
" it baffles us why chikane would say exportation should go ahead because there 's still smuggling in the fields , and the army has not been removed , " said tiseke kasambala , senior researcher in hrw 's africa division .
" we are still seeing forced labor , beatings and torture , and the sexual assault of women , " kasambala told deutsche welle .
" that is something that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency by the government of zimbabwe and by the kp . "
africa 's role the european union in a statement urged members of the certification scheme to put greater pressure on zimbabwe to improve the situation of mine workers to meet the minimum standards set out by the kp .
it followed on the heels of a us appeal .
philip crowley , a spokesman for the us state department , said that washington was " disappointed " that consensus was not reached in tel aviv .
" it is important that zimbabwe address the ongoing diamond smuggling and human rights violations in and around the marange diamond fields , " crowley told reporters .
bildunterschrift : women in the marange fields are often victims of violence and abuse by the security forces but while every participant involved in the kp had a role to play in urging the government to take its responsibilities seriously , it was zimbabwe 's neighboring countries which could have the most clout , dunnebacke said .
" other african nations , including south africa , have an extremely important role to play in pushing the authorities in zimbabwe toward compliance , " she said .
" the kimberley process is incredibly important for all african diamond-producing countries . "
the certification scheme had helped to bring more official diamond revenues to countries such as the democratic republic of congo and angola , as well as reduce smuggling , she said .
" it has given international credibility and legitimacy to the diamond trade , " dunnebacke said .
" it would be terrible for these african countries if the kimberley process was compromised and it 's up to those governments to put pressure on zimbabwe and to say , look , cut it out .
you 've got to play by the rules like the rest of us are trying to do . "
kasambala , however , said she felt the only remaining avenue to put pressure on the government of zimbabwe was the kp itself .
key governments within the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- , such as south africa , could exert great pressure .
but it was more concerned with zimbabwe as a whole .
south africa had been instrumental in helping establish a fragile power-sharing government between president robert mugabe and opposition politician morgan tsvangirai , now prime minister , of the movement for democratic change .
" sadc governments are more interested in the bigger picture and not necessarily in what 's going on in the marange diamond fields , " kasambala said .
" so the kp seems to be the sole organization that can put political pressure on the government of zimbabwe to improve the situation there . "
exports to go ahead the zimbabwean government does not appear to be feeling any pressure , though .
according to the state-controlled daily newspaper , the herald , the government has said it will immediately begin selling marange diamonds on the international market .
zimbabwe 's minister of mines obert mpofu had already made this intention clear at the meeting in tel aviv .
mpofu had also belittled the role of ngos in the kp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blood diamonds from zimbabwe continue to find their way into jewelry stores worldwide " the attitude the zimbabwean authorities have shown to the kimberley process over the past 18 months has been difficult - to put it mildly , " said dunnebacke , who attended the kp conference .
" we have n't always seen a high level of commitment or interest in respecting the rules and being compliant with kimberley process requirements . "
however , zimbabwe may have difficulties finding legal buyers for the gems until the kp reaches a consensus .
its 49 members , representing 75 countries , have agreed to only buy diamonds certified as " conflict-free . "
securing political power human rights organizations are now concerned that mugabe and his powerful party zanu-pf could use the funds from the fields to tighten their grip on power .
" the security forces that have been committing abuses in the marange diamond fields answer to zanu-pf , " said kasambala , who also attended the kp conference .
" a key arm of this government of national unity is benefitting from smuggling in those diamond fields and is likely to use the revenue to commit further abuses , perhaps even during the next elections in zimbabwe .
that is what we 're warning about . "
the marange fields are regarded as the wealthiest diamond find in the world in a century .
the potential revenue for zimbabwe from the area is estimated to run at $ 1 billion -lrb- 0.8 billion euros -rrb- to $ 1.7 billion per year .
" there is very much concern that revenues from marange are not going into state coffers , toward the unity government or development , but are going toward certain elite within the zanu-pf and could be used for political violence at some point in the near future , " dunnebacke said .
the detention of a prominent human rights activist at the beginning of june illustrates the importance of this new-found wealth for the zanu-pf .
authorities arrested farai maguwu , the director of the center for research and development in eastern zimbabwe , after he met with chikane and briefed him on the human rights violations in the marange mines .
" essentially he 's in prison because his ngo has been documenting and reporting on the abuses in the marange diamond fields , " dunnebacke said .
though human rights groups , the eu and the us have condemned maguwu 's arrest , zimbabwean authorities refuse to release him on bail .
kp talks are due to resume on july 14 and 15 in st. petersburg , russia .

following the full-time whistle , germans ran onto the streets in joy and embraced one another after watching their team roll over an underdone argentina .
others formed up motorcades to tour their cities , waving flags from car windows and honking horns .
joachim loew said there was now real belief his young team could go on to win the trophy for the first time in 20 years .
" we really turned in an incredible showing .
scoring four goals against argentina you just have to say that that was class .
and we closed down -lrb- lionel -rrb- messi very well - without resorting to fouls , so that was great , " said loew .
loew 's men tore apart diego maradona 's argentina , with long-serving striker miroslav klose scoring a brace , center-back arne friedrich enjoying a tap-in and 20-year-old thomas mueller heading in his fourth of the tournament .
the only downside of the game for the germans was that mueller picked up a yellow card late in the first half , meaning he will now miss germany 's semifinal clash with spain on wednesday .
loew said the bayern munich man would be sorely missed .
" the fact that we wo n't have mueller in the semifinal is a serious blow as over the past few matches he has shown how dangerous he is , " loew said .
" i really do n't see why he got booked .
the ball touches his thigh , then touches his arm from a really short distance . "
bildunterschrift : merkel , center-right , said watching the game was ' overwhelming ' spirited performance germany vice captain bastian schweinsteiger , who played an integral role in the quarterfinal win , applauded his teammates for their collective performance .
" we played very well .
i am very proud of the team , " he said .
" the early goal was decisive for us .
we are strong enough to go further .
the team is very young , but what we lack in experience we make up for in audacity and a carefree approach . "
among the 64,000 packed into green point stadium in cape town to cheer on the germans was the country 's leader , chancellor angela merkel , who paid a post-match visit to the players in their dressing room .
mueller said that merkel had told the team that the game had been wonderful .
" she said that she was shivering and shaking with excitement and it was only after the second and third goal that she started to relax and she then turned to south african president jacob zuma , next to whom she was sitting , and said that germany was going to win , " mueller said .
merkel called the victory " overwhelming " and " a dream . "
speaking to zdf television from cape town , merkel said that " germany has done something wonderful today , " adding that " it was overwhelming .
this is a dream , just a dream .
this is a young team but the way they played was very good .
they did n't give argentina much space . "
end of maradona experiment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speculation is now rife that maradona will step down from his post much speculation in argentina will now focus on the post-world cup future of diego maradona , who hinted strongly after the loss to germany that he would now quit as head coach .
" i 'm going to be 50 on october 30th , and this is the hardest thing i 've had to go through because i 'm in front of so many good players and good people , " he said at the post-match press conference .
" it 's like a knock-out punch from muhammad ali , and i do n't have the strength to do anything .
it was n't the ending we 'd hoped for , but i believe that whoever comes in next will have to continue on the same path because it 's the path the argentines want . "
meanwhile , the argentine press focused their attention on germany 's " steamroller " performance .
" germany laid bare all the deficiencies of the argentine side which , with neither carlos tevez , messi or -lrb- gonzalo -rrb- higuain at their best , had no answers in the face of adversity , " wrote la nacion daily .
" argentina had a bad time of it and left the world cup stage on the end of a thrashing from a german steamroller , " was the assessment of the infobae news website .
the daily clarin argued that lionel messi had not been used properly and was played too deep .
" he hung back too much for the ball to reach him .
he had a few bursts , which gave hope , yet the germans had him in their grip pretty much throughout .
he left the tournament without exploding into life or scoring any goals , " was the paper 's assessment .

zimbabwe 's minister of mines obert mpofu had already made this intention clear at the meeting in tel aviv .
mpofu had also belittled the role of ngos in the kp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blood diamonds from zimbabwe continue to find their way into jewelry stores worldwide " the attitude the zimbabwean authorities have shown to the kimberley process over the past 18 months has been difficult - to put it mildly , " said dunnebacke , who attended the kp conference .
" we have n't always seen a high level of commitment or interest in respecting the rules and being compliant with kimberley process requirements . "
however , zimbabwe may have difficulties finding legal buyers for the gems until the kp reaches a consensus .
its 49 members , representing 75 countries , have agreed to only buy diamonds certified as " conflict-free . "
securing political power human rights organizations are now concerned that mugabe and his powerful party zanu-pf could use the funds from the fields to tighten their grip on power .
" the security forces that have been committing abuses in the marange diamond fields answer to zanu-pf , " said kasambala , who also attended the kp conference .
" a key arm of this government of national unity is benefitting from smuggling in those diamond fields and is likely to use the revenue to commit further abuses , perhaps even during the next elections in zimbabwe .
that is what we 're warning about . "
the marange fields are regarded as the wealthiest diamond find in the world in a century .
the potential revenue for zimbabwe from the area is estimated to run at $ 1 billion -lrb- 0.8 billion euros -rrb- to $ 1.7 billion per year .
" there is very much concern that revenues from marange are not going into state coffers , toward the unity government or development , but are going toward certain elite within the zanu-pf and could be used for political violence at some point in the near future , " dunnebacke said .
the detention of a prominent human rights activist at the beginning of june illustrates the importance of this new-found wealth for the zanu-pf .
authorities arrested farai maguwu , the director of the center for research and development in eastern zimbabwe , after he met with chikane and briefed him on the human rights violations in the marange mines .
" essentially he 's in prison because his ngo has been documenting and reporting on the abuses in the marange diamond fields , " dunnebacke said .
though human rights groups , the eu and the us have condemned maguwu 's arrest , zimbabwean authorities refuse to release him on bail .
kp talks are due to resume on july 14 and 15 in st. petersburg , russia .

at a training center in accra , ghana , tomorrow 's peacekeepers are getting the preparation they need - with help from germany . a tense silence fell over an auditorium in ghana 's capital city , as haunting scenes from a documentary on sierra leone 's civil war flashed across the screen .
this film screening marked the start of a two-week crash course in peacekeeping for 90 police officers from around africa .
these men and women were scheduled for deployment to darfur as part of the united nations african union hybrid mission in darfur , or unamid .
to prepare them for their mission , the group received training here , at the kofi annan international peacekeeping training center , or kaiptc .
one of the trainers of the current class was fanny aboadje .
the young ghanaian police officer recently returned from an 18-month posting in darfur . she had gone through a training course at kaiptc herself before going on her mission . " darfur is a very complex and complicated mission , and so the training kind of helps you to settle down , and to know what you are about , " she said . " if you compare us to other officers who probably did n't have any training there were lots of gaps . "
first-hand experience is invaluable in training future peacekeepers , according to colonel leo hirschmann , who heads the training department at the kaiptc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonel leo hirschmann heads kaiptc 's training department " in an ideal setup , we send a student who has participated in the preparatory training to the particular region we prepared him for , " he said .
" and when he returns from that mission , he 's available for us as a facilitator . "
trainers are able to pass on their impressions of the mission to participants in the preparatory course - while the experiences are still fresh in their minds .
gerhard schroeder hall at the center of things as the program 's main sponsor , germany has played an instrumental role in establishing the kaiptc and has provided some 10 million euros in funding for the center so far .
when kaiptc opened in january 2004 , even then-german chancellor gerhard schroeder was on hand to mark the occasion .
today , the auditorium that houses training sessions bears his name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaiptc facility has trained several thousand participants the center stands on a site about the size of five soccer fields , not far from the atlantic coast .
blue buildings stretch skyward under the tropical sun .
with its well-groomed grass pitches , the center looks like a cross between a training center and military barracks .
the equipment is state of the art , featuring high-speed computers , a first-class canteen and a gym that trainees can use to stay fit .
almost 6,000 participants from more than 70 countries have participated in some 170 courses offered by the kaiptc since 2004 .
these two-week training courses for police put human rights , protection of women , and basic medical knowledge at the top of the agenda .
trainees can also participate in practical exercises , from role playing to driving instruction .
the latter course is designed to prepare participants for more than just road blocks and attacks : 80 percent of accidents that occur during peace missions are , in fact , traffic-related .
uniform fear policemen and -women must also be mindful of how they are perceived by people living in war-ravaged areas .
refugees , in particular , often have painful associations when it comes to officers in uniform .
amadu fofana , a kaiptc facilitator from mali , said trainees must keep this in mind when dealing with people they meet during their mission .
fofana visited the center to share his experiences from darfur , where he was posted for two years .
during his time there , he worked in communities where policemen had previously committed acts of rape and unprovoked attacks .
" the population loses all confidence with the police , " fofana said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many refugees have lost faith in the authorities fanny aboadje said the reality for peacekeepers on the ground often varies from place to place .
before her posting in darfur , she was stationed in east timor , a country in southeast asia .
she says one of the biggest problems facing the unamid forces in darfur is communication .
" in east timor , it looks to me that the people - the civilians - understood the role of the un , " she said .
" but in darfur , it looks to be that they do n't know why we are there , for various reasons .
so communication to get them to understand your mandates and your mission is very difficult . "
working toward conflict prevention communication is also a key discussion topic back at the training center , where 30 participants from across africa are learning about the art of negotiation .
this course was developed by kaiptc 's research department .
" our main objective is to give basic mediation and negotiation skills to them so that they can apply them in resolving basic conflicts that come up during peacekeeping operations , " said samuel atuabi , who works in the research department .
the team is instrumental in shaping the second main focus of the kaiptc : conflict prevention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most trainers at the kaiptc have just returned from peacekeeping missions in addition to the kaiptc , there are six peacekeeper training centers in africa .
ghana has participated in peacekeeping missions since the 1960s .
a local kaiptc chapter was launched in 1998 to take advantage of more than four decades ' worth of collective experiences .
each year , much of the ghanaian army is involved in peacekeeping missions abroad .
there are also financial incentives : soldiers and police officers themselves are enthusiastic participants in the peace missions – in part because they earn more wearing the un 's blue helmets abroad than they do without them at home .

so why is he suddenly having such a terrific world cup ?
ironically , being out of the spotlight has helped him shine . it may have taken 77 games , but he finally got one .
thirty-one-year-old central defender arne friedrich finally grabbed his first ever goal in german national dress in his side 's surprise 4-0 thrashing of argentina on saturday .
more importantly , though , he anchored a back-four that kept messi , tevez and higuain thoroughly at bay , not allowing the gauchos a single quality look at manuel neuer 's goal .
what 's more , he 's helped germany 's other interior defender , per mertesacker , get through some noticeable wobbles at the start of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : friedrich has picked up the slack for mertesacker " i spoke to him briefly after he came in for criticism , " friedrich said in an interview with the online edition of the german weekly die zeit .
" i told him that i could write a novel about criticism and that i would always be standing beside him on the pitch . "
if anyone had said two weeks ago that friedrich would have been joachim loew 's rock at the back , that person would probably have been put on prescription medications .
as germany headed to south africa , the defender 's place in germany 's starting eleven was anything but sure , and friedrich himself had just been relegated with his former club hertha berlin .
but as friedrich himself has said , not playing for hertha is one key to his renaissance .
bildunterschrift : a dream world cup has followed hertha 's nightmare season the defender , whose manner is usually guarded , has had a lot to say to the german press in the past week .
and the leitmotif has been liberation .
friedrich , the not-so-great " the pressure that i had on me the whole year completely fell away , and i became very relaxed , " friedrich told the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper when asked what it was like coming from relegated hertha to the national team .
after challenging for the bundesliga title in 2008-2009 , hertha plummeted to the bottom of the table early on last season and stayed there .
the inevitable squabbling commenced , and friedrich as captain was able neither to bring the team together nor perform up to speed on the pitch .
friedrich has since transferred to 2008-9 champions wolfsburg .
but the sight of the highly-paid veteran getting nutmegged in front of his own goal became all-too-familiar for hertha devotees .
" i had a very difficult year and played badly in the first half of the season , " friedrich acknowledged in the stadt-anzeiger .
" then i performed better , and we still went down .
as the captain , i was under extreme pressure , and i , too , made mistakes . "
rumors also persist that friedrich was part of a cabal that led to ex-hertha-coach lucien favre getting fired - something friedrich angrily denies .
and that is n't the only bad press that gets friedrich 's gander up .
bildunterschrift : germany 's number 3 was more than a match for stars like tevez although he 's been a fixture in the german national side since 2002 , friedrich has never gotten much love from either fans or the press .
" in 2006 , i also had to take a lot of criticism , " friedrich told die zeit .
" people wrote that i had never been a positive player .
i was never considered a savior , and people said i was just along for the ride … it really ticked me off when people wrote things that were n't true . "
but there was - and is - an element of truth in what was written .
while friedrich is certainly not just along for the ride , he is anything but a natural-born leader .
ahead of the argentina game , while most of the team joked around on the balcony of their hotel in cape town , friedrich was filmed walking alone on the beach staring at the waves .
he himself says he 's not a buddy-buddy sort of player .
" true friendships are very rare in football , " he told die zeit .
that 's about as personal a statement as any journalist is likely to get from the articulate , but wary defender .
and it may explain why , although friedrich is one of only two long-time veterans in the squad , coach joachim loew chose ever-cheerful philipp lahm as his captain and extroverted bastian schweinsteiger as his " on-field leader . "
conversely , friedrich seems to have benefited from being out of the focus - and able to breathe a bit easier .
" unfortunately , i ca n't do anything to change the facts and keep hertha in the first division , " friedrich told die zeit .
" when i joined up again with the national team , it was like a liberation . "
freed from any responsibilities larger than keeping a tight ship at the back , friedrich has turned in five fine performances - more than most defenders in south africa can say .
he 's even finally gotten that elusive first goal for the national team .
and he may even get a first world cup title to cap off his unlikely comeback .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch world cup -pipe- 04.07.2010 ' liberated ' veteran arne friedrich is germany 's secret star großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich has been one of the world cup 's best defenders defender arne friedrich was the captain of the worst team in the bundesliga last season .
so why is he suddenly having such a terrific world cup ?
ironically , being out of the spotlight has helped him shine . it may have taken 77 games , but he finally got one .
thirty-one-year-old central defender arne friedrich finally grabbed his first ever goal in german national dress in his side 's surprise 4-0 thrashing of argentina on saturday .
more importantly , though , he anchored a back-four that kept messi , tevez and higuain thoroughly at bay , not allowing the gauchos a single quality look at manuel neuer 's goal .
what 's more , he 's helped germany 's other interior defender , per mertesacker , get through some noticeable wobbles at the start of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : friedrich has picked up the slack for mertesacker " i spoke to him briefly after he came in for criticism , " friedrich said in an interview with the online edition of the german weekly die zeit .
" i told him that i could write a novel about criticism and that i would always be standing beside him on the pitch . "
if anyone had said two weeks ago that friedrich would have been joachim loew 's rock at the back , that person would probably have been put on prescription medications .
as germany headed to south africa , the defender 's place in germany 's starting eleven was anything but sure , and friedrich himself had just been relegated with his former club hertha berlin .
but as friedrich himself has said , not playing for hertha is one key to his renaissance .
bildunterschrift : a dream world cup has followed hertha 's nightmare season the defender , whose manner is usually guarded , has had a lot to say to the german press in the past week .
and the leitmotif has been liberation .
friedrich , the not-so-great " the pressure that i had on me the whole year completely fell away , and i became very relaxed , " friedrich told the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper when asked what it was like coming from relegated hertha to the national team .
after challenging for the bundesliga title in 2008-2009 , hertha plummeted to the bottom of the table early on last season and stayed there .
the inevitable squabbling commenced , and friedrich as captain was able neither to bring the team together nor perform up to speed on the pitch .
friedrich has since transferred to 2008-9 champions wolfsburg .
but the sight of the highly-paid veteran getting nutmegged in front of his own goal became all-too-familiar for hertha devotees .
" i had a very difficult year and played badly in the first half of the season , " friedrich acknowledged in the stadt-anzeiger .
" then i performed better , and we still went down .
as the captain , i was under extreme pressure , and i , too , made mistakes . "
rumors also persist that friedrich was part of a cabal that led to ex-hertha-coach lucien favre getting fired - something friedrich angrily denies .
and that is n't the only bad press that gets friedrich 's gander up .
bildunterschrift : germany 's number 3 was more than a match for stars like tevez although he 's been a fixture in the german national side since 2002 , friedrich has never gotten much love from either fans or the press .
" in 2006 , i also had to take a lot of criticism , " friedrich told die zeit .
" people wrote that i had never been a positive player .
i was never considered a savior , and people said i was just along for the ride … it really ticked me off when people wrote things that were n't true . "
but there was - and is - an element of truth in what was written .
while friedrich is certainly not just along for the ride , he is anything but a natural-born leader .
ahead of the argentina game , while most of the team joked around on the balcony of their hotel in cape town , friedrich was filmed walking alone on the beach staring at the waves .
he himself says he 's not a buddy-buddy sort of player .
" true friendships are very rare in football , " he told die zeit .
that 's about as personal a statement as any journalist is likely to get from the articulate , but wary defender .
and it may explain why , although friedrich is one of only two long-time veterans in the squad , coach joachim loew chose ever-cheerful philipp lahm as his captain and extroverted bastian schweinsteiger as his " on-field leader . "
conversely , friedrich seems to have benefited from being out of the focus - and able to breathe a bit easier .
" unfortunately , i ca n't do anything to change the facts and keep hertha in the first division , " friedrich told die zeit .
" when i joined up again with the national team , it was like a liberation . "
freed from any responsibilities larger than keeping a tight ship at the back , friedrich has turned in five fine performances - more than most defenders in south africa can say .
he 's even finally gotten that elusive first goal for the national team .
and he may even get a first world cup title to cap off his unlikely comeback .

following the full-time whistle , germans ran onto the streets in joy and embraced one another after watching their team roll over an underdone argentina .
others formed up motorcades to tour their cities , waving flags from car windows and honking horns .
joachim loew said there was now real belief his young team could go on to win the trophy for the first time in 20 years .
" we really turned in an incredible showing .
scoring four goals against argentina you just have to say that that was class .
and we closed down -lrb- lionel -rrb- messi very well - without resorting to fouls , so that was great , " said loew .
loew 's men tore apart diego maradona 's argentina , with long-serving striker miroslav klose scoring a brace , center-back arne friedrich enjoying a tap-in and 20-year-old thomas mueller heading in his fourth of the tournament .
the only downside of the game for the germans was that mueller picked up a yellow card late in the first half , meaning he will now miss germany 's semifinal clash with spain on wednesday .
loew said the bayern munich man would be sorely missed .
" the fact that we wo n't have mueller in the semifinal is a serious blow as over the past few matches he has shown how dangerous he is , " loew said .

among the 64,000 packed into green point stadium in cape town to cheer on the germans was the country 's leader , chancellor angela merkel , who paid a post-match visit to the players in their dressing room .
mueller said that merkel had told the team that the game had been wonderful .
" she said that she was shivering and shaking with excitement and it was only after the second and third goal that she started to relax and she then turned to south african president jacob zuma , next to whom she was sitting , and said that germany was going to win , " mueller said .

" sweat and tears " is the daily sports paper ole 's online headline .
" this time it was worse than being beaten by -lsb- germany -rsb- four years ago because they scored so early and diego -lsb- maradona -rsb- had no answer , " it adds .
la nacion is no less blunt in its analysis : " germany exposed our weaknesses , left us naked .
argentina had no answers in the face of adversity , with neither carlos tevez nor messi at their best . "
the daily clarin says that argentine star lionel messi was used improperly against the " intelligent rival " germany : " he hung back too much for the ball to reach him .
he had a few bursts which gave hope yet the germans had him in their grip pretty much throughout .
he left the tournament without exploding into life or scoring any goals . "
the response from germany : simply madness !
german newspapers on sunday are shimmering with praise for their team .

thank you our heroes ! "

the paper goes on to say : " first 4-1 against england , now 4-0 against argentina .
german soccer has never experienced such a spectacular week . "
one of the capital 's dailies , the berliner tagesspiegel , writes : " simply madness !
what a team , what a tournament !
the entire world is now celebrating german soccer . "
international praise of germany widespread indeed , the international reception of germany 's victory is one of resounding praise .
the dutch daily de volkskrant runs the headline : " the germans chop up argentina in the frying pan , " adding that " joachim loew 's team was just too strong for the south americans led by diego maradona . " in uruguay , who will face the netherlands in the first semifinal on tuesday , the daily el observador writes " germany struck down argentina , hit them with all the forcefulness that comes with a winning score and laid in the open the misery of diego maradona 's team , all the while showing the world that it 's not a casual candidate for winning the world cup in south africa , but rather a serious favorite . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona 's ' dream has died ' , the guardian wrote spain 's el pais also is full of praise for the young german side . " germany crushes the hopes of maradona .
the loew team gives a recital to an argentian side without a midfielder . "
spain will face germany in the second seminfinal on wednesday . le monde in france wraps up the quarterfinals by pointing out that the much favored south american teams did n't live up to pre-tournament expectations and that the world cup is becoming a largely european affair .
" germany-spain and the netherlands-uruguay are the pairs of semi-finals of the world cup in south africa .
the argentine and brazilian favorites have fallen while ghana has entered legend although beaten by uruguay . " the uk 's the guardian 's assessment focuses on diego maradona , argentina 's dejected coach : " if it had indeed been the will of god that argentina should claim this world cup , then maradona must feel utterly abandoned now .

" bavaria became the first german state on sunday to endorse a total smoking ban following a referendum putting an end to smoking in all public buildings .
over three million voters participated in the southern german state 's sixth referendum , with 61 percent voting in favor of the ban , according to the director of state elections .
the citizens ' initiative " for real protection of non-smokers " will impose a total smoking ban on all clubs , bars , restaurants , cafes and beer tents .
the muenchner merkur newspaper on sunday called the vote a " landmark and surprisingly clear " decision .
" few german citizens had trusted the bavarians , often ridiculed as provincial , to show such decisiveness , " the paper said .
emotive issue the referendum was prompted by a heated debate in bavaria , pitting bar owners and restaurant associations against anti-smoking campaigners .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , bavaria 's governing party , had introduced germany 's strongest smoking ban at the beginning of 2008 . but the rules were relaxed a few months later , when the csu formed a state coalition with the free democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's premier seehofer gave up smoking at his wife 's request smoking is currently tolerated in small pubs and side-rooms of taverns , as well as in the oktoberfest 's famed beer tents .
the initiative to restore the original ban was backed by the green party and the social democrats .
the new legislation mandates that smoking will be outlawed in all public buildings beginning august 1 .
the rules will also apply to the oktoberfest , but officials have said that the ban will not be enforced there this year .
bavarian premier horst seehofer told daily tabloid bild preceding the referendum that his ruling csu party could live with either possible result of the referendum .
seehofer told the newspaper that he himself had given up social smoking at his wife 's request .

the only downside of the game for the germans was that mueller picked up a yellow card late in the first half , meaning he will now miss germany 's semifinal clash with spain on wednesday .
loew said the bayern munich man would be sorely missed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 04.07.2010 zimbabwe urged to improve standards in diamond mines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the diamonds in the marange fields could bring zimbabwe up to $ 1.7 billion in revenue a year both the eu and the us have called on zimbabwe to intensify efforts to improve conditions in the african nation 's marange diamond mines .
human rights groups continue to document military abuse against workers there . the controversy surrounding zimbabwe 's marange diamond fields could not be resolved at a conference of the un-backed kimberley process -lrb- kp -rrb- , which regulates the worldwide trade of conflict diamonds .
delegates at the recent kp meeting in tel aviv failed to reach a consensus on whether to allow zimbabwe to resume exporting marange diamonds .
the kp withdrew certification of the fields last november after its investigators documented forced labor , beatings and other abuses by the military against civilians working in the diamond fields .
human rights groups have called for zimbabwe to be suspended from the kp , saying it had not fulfilled its promise made last year to improve conditions at its marange fields .
" the controversial marange diamond fields have seen and continue to see quite a high level of human rights abuses and the militarization of mining , " annie dunnebacke , a campaigner at the non-governmental organization global witness , told deutsche welle .
global witness focuses its work on natural-resource related conflicts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small percentage of these raw diamonds are of gem quality a report by kp investigator abbey chikane presented at the tel aviv conference argued that president robert mugabe 's government had met the regulator 's criteria in respect to the marange diamond fields .
but human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- has received new reports that soldiers are engaging in forced labor , torture , beatings and harassment in the marange diamond fields around chiadzwa , 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- east of the zimbabwean capital harare .
" it baffles us why chikane would say exportation should go ahead because there 's still smuggling in the fields , and the army has not been removed , " said tiseke kasambala , senior researcher in hrw 's africa division .
" we are still seeing forced labor , beatings and torture , and the sexual assault of women , " kasambala told deutsche welle .
" that is something that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency by the government of zimbabwe and by the kp . "
africa 's role the european union in a statement urged members of the certification scheme to put greater pressure on zimbabwe to improve the situation of mine workers to meet the minimum standards set out by the kp .
it followed on the heels of a us appeal .
philip crowley , a spokesman for the us state department , said that washington was " disappointed " that consensus was not reached in tel aviv .
" it is important that zimbabwe address the ongoing diamond smuggling and human rights violations in and around the marange diamond fields , " crowley told reporters .
bildunterschrift : women in the marange fields are often victims of violence and abuse by the security forces but while every participant involved in the kp had a role to play in urging the government to take its responsibilities seriously , it was zimbabwe 's neighboring countries which could have the most clout , dunnebacke said .
" other african nations , including south africa , have an extremely important role to play in pushing the authorities in zimbabwe toward compliance , " she said .
" the kimberley process is incredibly important for all african diamond-producing countries . "
the certification scheme had helped to bring more official diamond revenues to countries such as the democratic republic of congo and angola , as well as reduce smuggling , she said .
" it has given international credibility and legitimacy to the diamond trade , " dunnebacke said .
" it would be terrible for these african countries if the kimberley process was compromised and it 's up to those governments to put pressure on zimbabwe and to say , look , cut it out .
you 've got to play by the rules like the rest of us are trying to do . "
kasambala , however , said she felt the only remaining avenue to put pressure on the government of zimbabwe was the kp itself .
key governments within the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- , such as south africa , could exert great pressure .
but it was more concerned with zimbabwe as a whole .
south africa had been instrumental in helping establish a fragile power-sharing government between president robert mugabe and opposition politician morgan tsvangirai , now prime minister , of the movement for democratic change .
" sadc governments are more interested in the bigger picture and not necessarily in what 's going on in the marange diamond fields , " kasambala said .
" so the kp seems to be the sole organization that can put political pressure on the government of zimbabwe to improve the situation there . "
exports to go ahead the zimbabwean government does not appear to be feeling any pressure , though .
according to the state-controlled daily newspaper , the herald , the government has said it will immediately begin selling marange diamonds on the international market .
zimbabwe 's minister of mines obert mpofu had already made this intention clear at the meeting in tel aviv .
mpofu had also belittled the role of ngos in the kp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blood diamonds from zimbabwe continue to find their way into jewelry stores worldwide " the attitude the zimbabwean authorities have shown to the kimberley process over the past 18 months has been difficult - to put it mildly , " said dunnebacke , who attended the kp conference .
" we have n't always seen a high level of commitment or interest in respecting the rules and being compliant with kimberley process requirements . "
however , zimbabwe may have difficulties finding legal buyers for the gems until the kp reaches a consensus .
its 49 members , representing 75 countries , have agreed to only buy diamonds certified as " conflict-free . "
securing political power human rights organizations are now concerned that mugabe and his powerful party zanu-pf could use the funds from the fields to tighten their grip on power .
" the security forces that have been committing abuses in the marange diamond fields answer to zanu-pf , " said kasambala , who also attended the kp conference .
" a key arm of this government of national unity is benefitting from smuggling in those diamond fields and is likely to use the revenue to commit further abuses , perhaps even during the next elections in zimbabwe .
that is what we 're warning about . "
the marange fields are regarded as the wealthiest diamond find in the world in a century .
the potential revenue for zimbabwe from the area is estimated to run at $ 1 billion -lrb- 0.8 billion euros -rrb- to $ 1.7 billion per year .
" there is very much concern that revenues from marange are not going into state coffers , toward the unity government or development , but are going toward certain elite within the zanu-pf and could be used for political violence at some point in the near future , " dunnebacke said .
the detention of a prominent human rights activist at the beginning of june illustrates the importance of this new-found wealth for the zanu-pf .
authorities arrested farai maguwu , the director of the center for research and development in eastern zimbabwe , after he met with chikane and briefed him on the human rights violations in the marange mines .
" essentially he 's in prison because his ngo has been documenting and reporting on the abuses in the marange diamond fields , " dunnebacke said .
though human rights groups , the eu and the us have condemned maguwu 's arrest , zimbabwean authorities refuse to release him on bail .
kp talks are due to resume on july 14 and 15 in st. petersburg , russia .

human rights groups continue to document military abuse against workers there . the controversy surrounding zimbabwe 's marange diamond fields could not be resolved at a conference of the un-backed kimberley process -lrb- kp -rrb- , which regulates the worldwide trade of conflict diamonds .
delegates at the recent kp meeting in tel aviv failed to reach a consensus on whether to allow zimbabwe to resume exporting marange diamonds .
the kp withdrew certification of the fields last november after its investigators documented forced labor , beatings and other abuses by the military against civilians working in the diamond fields .
human rights groups have called for zimbabwe to be suspended from the kp , saying it had not fulfilled its promise made last year to improve conditions at its marange fields .
" the controversial marange diamond fields have seen and continue to see quite a high level of human rights abuses and the militarization of mining , " annie dunnebacke , a campaigner at the non-governmental organization global witness , told deutsche welle .
global witness focuses its work on natural-resource related conflicts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small percentage of these raw diamonds are of gem quality a report by kp investigator abbey chikane presented at the tel aviv conference argued that president robert mugabe 's government had met the regulator 's criteria in respect to the marange diamond fields .
but human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- has received new reports that soldiers are engaging in forced labor , torture , beatings and harassment in the marange diamond fields around chiadzwa , 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- east of the zimbabwean capital harare .
" it baffles us why chikane would say exportation should go ahead because there 's still smuggling in the fields , and the army has not been removed , " said tiseke kasambala , senior researcher in hrw 's africa division .
" we are still seeing forced labor , beatings and torture , and the sexual assault of women , " kasambala told deutsche welle .
" that is something that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency by the government of zimbabwe and by the kp . "
africa 's role the european union in a statement urged members of the certification scheme to put greater pressure on zimbabwe to improve the situation of mine workers to meet the minimum standards set out by the kp .
it followed on the heels of a us appeal .
philip crowley , a spokesman for the us state department , said that washington was " disappointed " that consensus was not reached in tel aviv .
" it is important that zimbabwe address the ongoing diamond smuggling and human rights violations in and around the marange diamond fields , " crowley told reporters .
bildunterschrift : women in the marange fields are often victims of violence and abuse by the security forces but while every participant involved in the kp had a role to play in urging the government to take its responsibilities seriously , it was zimbabwe 's neighboring countries which could have the most clout , dunnebacke said .
" other african nations , including south africa , have an extremely important role to play in pushing the authorities in zimbabwe toward compliance , " she said .
" the kimberley process is incredibly important for all african diamond-producing countries . "
the certification scheme had helped to bring more official diamond revenues to countries such as the democratic republic of congo and angola , as well as reduce smuggling , she said .
" it has given international credibility and legitimacy to the diamond trade , " dunnebacke said .
" it would be terrible for these african countries if the kimberley process was compromised and it 's up to those governments to put pressure on zimbabwe and to say , look , cut it out .
you 've got to play by the rules like the rest of us are trying to do . "
kasambala , however , said she felt the only remaining avenue to put pressure on the government of zimbabwe was the kp itself .
key governments within the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- , such as south africa , could exert great pressure .
but it was more concerned with zimbabwe as a whole .
south africa had been instrumental in helping establish a fragile power-sharing government between president robert mugabe and opposition politician morgan tsvangirai , now prime minister , of the movement for democratic change .
" sadc governments are more interested in the bigger picture and not necessarily in what 's going on in the marange diamond fields , " kasambala said .
" so the kp seems to be the sole organization that can put political pressure on the government of zimbabwe to improve the situation there . "
exports to go ahead the zimbabwean government does not appear to be feeling any pressure , though .
according to the state-controlled daily newspaper , the herald , the government has said it will immediately begin selling marange diamonds on the international market .
zimbabwe 's minister of mines obert mpofu had already made this intention clear at the meeting in tel aviv .
mpofu had also belittled the role of ngos in the kp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blood diamonds from zimbabwe continue to find their way into jewelry stores worldwide " the attitude the zimbabwean authorities have shown to the kimberley process over the past 18 months has been difficult - to put it mildly , " said dunnebacke , who attended the kp conference .
" we have n't always seen a high level of commitment or interest in respecting the rules and being compliant with kimberley process requirements . "
however , zimbabwe may have difficulties finding legal buyers for the gems until the kp reaches a consensus .
its 49 members , representing 75 countries , have agreed to only buy diamonds certified as " conflict-free . "
securing political power human rights organizations are now concerned that mugabe and his powerful party zanu-pf could use the funds from the fields to tighten their grip on power .
" the security forces that have been committing abuses in the marange diamond fields answer to zanu-pf , " said kasambala , who also attended the kp conference .
" a key arm of this government of national unity is benefitting from smuggling in those diamond fields and is likely to use the revenue to commit further abuses , perhaps even during the next elections in zimbabwe .
that is what we 're warning about . "
the marange fields are regarded as the wealthiest diamond find in the world in a century .
the potential revenue for zimbabwe from the area is estimated to run at $ 1 billion -lrb- 0.8 billion euros -rrb- to $ 1.7 billion per year .
" there is very much concern that revenues from marange are not going into state coffers , toward the unity government or development , but are going toward certain elite within the zanu-pf and could be used for political violence at some point in the near future , " dunnebacke said .
the detention of a prominent human rights activist at the beginning of june illustrates the importance of this new-found wealth for the zanu-pf .
authorities arrested farai maguwu , the director of the center for research and development in eastern zimbabwe , after he met with chikane and briefed him on the human rights violations in the marange mines .
" essentially he 's in prison because his ngo has been documenting and reporting on the abuses in the marange diamond fields , " dunnebacke said .
though human rights groups , the eu and the us have condemned maguwu 's arrest , zimbabwean authorities refuse to release him on bail .
kp talks are due to resume on july 14 and 15 in st. petersburg , russia .

following the full-time whistle , germans ran onto the streets in joy and embraced one another after watching their team roll over an underdone argentina .
others formed up motorcades to tour their cities , waving flags from car windows and honking horns .
joachim loew said there was now real belief his young team could go on to win the trophy for the first time in 20 years .
" we really turned in an incredible showing .
scoring four goals against argentina you just have to say that that was class .
and we closed down -lrb- lionel -rrb- messi very well - without resorting to fouls , so that was great , " said loew .
loew 's men tore apart diego maradona 's argentina , with long-serving striker miroslav klose scoring a brace , center-back arne friedrich enjoying a tap-in and 20-year-old thomas mueller heading in his fourth of the tournament .
the only downside of the game for the germans was that mueller picked up a yellow card late in the first half , meaning he will now miss germany 's semifinal clash with spain on wednesday .
loew said the bayern munich man would be sorely missed .
" the fact that we wo n't have mueller in the semifinal is a serious blow as over the past few matches he has shown how dangerous he is , " loew said .
" i really do n't see why he got booked .
the ball touches his thigh , then touches his arm from a really short distance . "
bildunterschrift : merkel , center-right , said watching the game was ' overwhelming ' spirited performance germany vice captain bastian schweinsteiger , who played an integral role in the quarterfinal win , applauded his teammates for their collective performance .
" we played very well .
i am very proud of the team , " he said .
" the early goal was decisive for us .
we are strong enough to go further .
the team is very young , but what we lack in experience we make up for in audacity and a carefree approach . "
among the 64,000 packed into green point stadium in cape town to cheer on the germans was the country 's leader , chancellor angela merkel , who paid a post-match visit to the players in their dressing room .
mueller said that merkel had told the team that the game had been wonderful .
" she said that she was shivering and shaking with excitement and it was only after the second and third goal that she started to relax and she then turned to south african president jacob zuma , next to whom she was sitting , and said that germany was going to win , " mueller said .
merkel called the victory " overwhelming " and " a dream . "
speaking to zdf television from cape town , merkel said that " germany has done something wonderful today , " adding that " it was overwhelming .
this is a dream , just a dream .
this is a young team but the way they played was very good .
they did n't give argentina much space . "
end of maradona experiment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speculation is now rife that maradona will step down from his post much speculation in argentina will now focus on the post-world cup future of diego maradona , who hinted strongly after the loss to germany that he would now quit as head coach .
" i 'm going to be 50 on october 30th , and this is the hardest thing i 've had to go through because i 'm in front of so many good players and good people , " he said at the post-match press conference .
" it 's like a knock-out punch from muhammad ali , and i do n't have the strength to do anything .
it was n't the ending we 'd hoped for , but i believe that whoever comes in next will have to continue on the same path because it 's the path the argentines want . "
meanwhile , the argentine press focused their attention on germany 's " steamroller " performance .
" germany laid bare all the deficiencies of the argentine side which , with neither carlos tevez , messi or -lrb- gonzalo -rrb- higuain at their best , had no answers in the face of adversity , " wrote la nacion daily .
" argentina had a bad time of it and left the world cup stage on the end of a thrashing from a german steamroller , " was the assessment of the infobae news website .
the daily clarin argued that lionel messi had not been used properly and was played too deep .
" he hung back too much for the ball to reach him .
he had a few bursts , which gave hope , yet the germans had him in their grip pretty much throughout .
he left the tournament without exploding into life or scoring any goals , " was the paper 's assessment .

la nacion is no less blunt in its analysis : " germany exposed our weaknesses , left us naked .
argentina had no answers in the face of adversity , with neither carlos tevez nor messi at their best . "
the daily clarin says that argentine star lionel messi was used improperly against the " intelligent rival " germany : " he hung back too much for the ball to reach him .

" bavaria became the first german state on sunday to endorse a total smoking ban following a referendum putting an end to smoking in all public buildings .
over three million voters participated in the southern german state 's sixth referendum , with 61 percent voting in favor of the ban , according to the director of state elections .
the citizens ' initiative " for real protection of non-smokers " will impose a total smoking ban on all clubs , bars , restaurants , cafes and beer tents .
the muenchner merkur newspaper on sunday called the vote a " landmark and surprisingly clear " decision .
" few german citizens had trusted the bavarians , often ridiculed as provincial , to show such decisiveness , " the paper said .
emotive issue the referendum was prompted by a heated debate in bavaria , pitting bar owners and restaurant associations against anti-smoking campaigners .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , bavaria 's governing party , had introduced germany 's strongest smoking ban at the beginning of 2008 . but the rules were relaxed a few months later , when the csu formed a state coalition with the free democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's premier seehofer gave up smoking at his wife 's request smoking is currently tolerated in small pubs and side-rooms of taverns , as well as in the oktoberfest 's famed beer tents .
the initiative to restore the original ban was backed by the green party and the social democrats .
the new legislation mandates that smoking will be outlawed in all public buildings beginning august 1 .
the rules will also apply to the oktoberfest , but officials have said that the ban will not be enforced there this year .
bavarian premier horst seehofer told daily tabloid bild preceding the referendum that his ruling csu party could live with either possible result of the referendum .
seehofer told the newspaper that he himself had given up social smoking at his wife 's request .

so why is he suddenly having such a terrific world cup ?
ironically , being out of the spotlight has helped him shine . it may have taken 77 games , but he finally got one .
thirty-one-year-old central defender arne friedrich finally grabbed his first ever goal in german national dress in his side 's surprise 4-0 thrashing of argentina on saturday .
more importantly , though , he anchored a back-four that kept messi , tevez and higuain thoroughly at bay , not allowing the gauchos a single quality look at manuel neuer 's goal .
what 's more , he 's helped germany 's other interior defender , per mertesacker , get through some noticeable wobbles at the start of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : friedrich has picked up the slack for mertesacker " i spoke to him briefly after he came in for criticism , " friedrich said in an interview with the online edition of the german weekly die zeit .
" i told him that i could write a novel about criticism and that i would always be standing beside him on the pitch . "
if anyone had said two weeks ago that friedrich would have been joachim loew 's rock at the back , that person would probably have been put on prescription medications .
as germany headed to south africa , the defender 's place in germany 's starting eleven was anything but sure , and friedrich himself had just been relegated with his former club hertha berlin .
but as friedrich himself has said , not playing for hertha is one key to his renaissance .
bildunterschrift : a dream world cup has followed hertha 's nightmare season the defender , whose manner is usually guarded , has had a lot to say to the german press in the past week .
and the leitmotif has been liberation .
friedrich , the not-so-great " the pressure that i had on me the whole year completely fell away , and i became very relaxed , " friedrich told the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper when asked what it was like coming from relegated hertha to the national team .
after challenging for the bundesliga title in 2008-2009 , hertha plummeted to the bottom of the table early on last season and stayed there .
the inevitable squabbling commenced , and friedrich as captain was able neither to bring the team together nor perform up to speed on the pitch .
friedrich has since transferred to 2008-9 champions wolfsburg .
but the sight of the highly-paid veteran getting nutmegged in front of his own goal became all-too-familiar for hertha devotees .
" i had a very difficult year and played badly in the first half of the season , " friedrich acknowledged in the stadt-anzeiger .
" then i performed better , and we still went down .
as the captain , i was under extreme pressure , and i , too , made mistakes . "
rumors also persist that friedrich was part of a cabal that led to ex-hertha-coach lucien favre getting fired - something friedrich angrily denies .
and that is n't the only bad press that gets friedrich 's gander up .
bildunterschrift : germany 's number 3 was more than a match for stars like tevez although he 's been a fixture in the german national side since 2002 , friedrich has never gotten much love from either fans or the press .
" in 2006 , i also had to take a lot of criticism , " friedrich told die zeit .
" people wrote that i had never been a positive player .
i was never considered a savior , and people said i was just along for the ride … it really ticked me off when people wrote things that were n't true . "
but there was - and is - an element of truth in what was written .
while friedrich is certainly not just along for the ride , he is anything but a natural-born leader .
ahead of the argentina game , while most of the team joked around on the balcony of their hotel in cape town , friedrich was filmed walking alone on the beach staring at the waves .
he himself says he 's not a buddy-buddy sort of player .
" true friendships are very rare in football , " he told die zeit .
that 's about as personal a statement as any journalist is likely to get from the articulate , but wary defender .
and it may explain why , although friedrich is one of only two long-time veterans in the squad , coach joachim loew chose ever-cheerful philipp lahm as his captain and extroverted bastian schweinsteiger as his " on-field leader . "
conversely , friedrich seems to have benefited from being out of the focus - and able to breathe a bit easier .
" unfortunately , i ca n't do anything to change the facts and keep hertha in the first division , " friedrich told die zeit .
" when i joined up again with the national team , it was like a liberation . "
freed from any responsibilities larger than keeping a tight ship at the back , friedrich has turned in five fine performances - more than most defenders in south africa can say .
he 's even finally gotten that elusive first goal for the national team .
and he may even get a first world cup title to cap off his unlikely comeback .

but the sight of the highly-paid veteran getting nutmegged in front of his own goal became all-too-familiar for hertha devotees .
" i had a very difficult year and played badly in the first half of the season , " friedrich acknowledged in the stadt-anzeiger .
" then i performed better , and we still went down .
as the captain , i was under extreme pressure , and i , too , made mistakes . "
rumors also persist that friedrich was part of a cabal that led to ex-hertha-coach lucien favre getting fired - something friedrich angrily denies .
and that is n't the only bad press that gets friedrich 's gander up .
bildunterschrift : germany 's number 3 was more than a match for stars like tevez although he 's been a fixture in the german national side since 2002 , friedrich has never gotten much love from either fans or the press .
" in 2006 , i also had to take a lot of criticism , " friedrich told die zeit .
" people wrote that i had never been a positive player .
i was never considered a savior , and people said i was just along for the ride … it really ticked me off when people wrote things that were n't true . "
but there was - and is - an element of truth in what was written .
while friedrich is certainly not just along for the ride , he is anything but a natural-born leader .
ahead of the argentina game , while most of the team joked around on the balcony of their hotel in cape town , friedrich was filmed walking alone on the beach staring at the waves .
he himself says he 's not a buddy-buddy sort of player .
" true friendships are very rare in football , " he told die zeit .
that 's about as personal a statement as any journalist is likely to get from the articulate , but wary defender .
and it may explain why , although friedrich is one of only two long-time veterans in the squad , coach joachim loew chose ever-cheerful philipp lahm as his captain and extroverted bastian schweinsteiger as his " on-field leader . "
conversely , friedrich seems to have benefited from being out of the focus - and able to breathe a bit easier .
" unfortunately , i ca n't do anything to change the facts and keep hertha in the first division , " friedrich told die zeit .
" when i joined up again with the national team , it was like a liberation . "
freed from any responsibilities larger than keeping a tight ship at the back , friedrich has turned in five fine performances - more than most defenders in south africa can say .
he 's even finally gotten that elusive first goal for the national team .
and he may even get a first world cup title to cap off his unlikely comeback .

so why is he suddenly having such a terrific world cup ?
ironically , being out of the spotlight has helped him shine . it may have taken 77 games , but he finally got one .
thirty-one-year-old central defender arne friedrich finally grabbed his first ever goal in german national dress in his side 's surprise 4-0 thrashing of argentina on saturday .
more importantly , though , he anchored a back-four that kept messi , tevez and higuain thoroughly at bay , not allowing the gauchos a single quality look at manuel neuer 's goal .
what 's more , he 's helped germany 's other interior defender , per mertesacker , get through some noticeable wobbles at the start of the tournament .

if anyone had said two weeks ago that friedrich would have been joachim loew 's rock at the back , that person would probably have been put on prescription medications .
as germany headed to south africa , the defender 's place in germany 's starting eleven was anything but sure , and friedrich himself had just been relegated with his former club hertha berlin .

and the leitmotif has been liberation .
friedrich , the not-so-great " the pressure that i had on me the whole year completely fell away , and i became very relaxed , " friedrich told the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper when asked what it was like coming from relegated hertha to the national team .

" bavaria became the first german state on sunday to endorse a total smoking ban following a referendum putting an end to smoking in all public buildings .
over three million voters participated in the southern german state 's sixth referendum , with 61 percent voting in favor of the ban , according to the director of state elections .
the citizens ' initiative " for real protection of non-smokers " will impose a total smoking ban on all clubs , bars , restaurants , cafes and beer tents .
the muenchner merkur newspaper on sunday called the vote a " landmark and surprisingly clear " decision .
" few german citizens had trusted the bavarians , often ridiculed as provincial , to show such decisiveness , " the paper said .
emotive issue the referendum was prompted by a heated debate in bavaria , pitting bar owners and restaurant associations against anti-smoking campaigners .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , bavaria 's governing party , had introduced germany 's strongest smoking ban at the beginning of 2008 . but the rules were relaxed a few months later , when the csu formed a state coalition with the free democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's premier seehofer gave up smoking at his wife 's request smoking is currently tolerated in small pubs and side-rooms of taverns , as well as in the oktoberfest 's famed beer tents .
the initiative to restore the original ban was backed by the green party and the social democrats .
the new legislation mandates that smoking will be outlawed in all public buildings beginning august 1 .
the rules will also apply to the oktoberfest , but officials have said that the ban will not be enforced there this year .
bavarian premier horst seehofer told daily tabloid bild preceding the referendum that his ruling csu party could live with either possible result of the referendum .
seehofer told the newspaper that he himself had given up social smoking at his wife 's request .

" true friendships are very rare in football , " he told die zeit .
that 's about as personal a statement as any journalist is likely to get from the articulate , but wary defender .
and it may explain why , although friedrich is one of only two long-time veterans in the squad , coach joachim loew chose ever-cheerful philipp lahm as his captain and extroverted bastian schweinsteiger as his " on-field leader . "
conversely , friedrich seems to have benefited from being out of the focus - and able to breathe a bit easier .
" unfortunately , i ca n't do anything to change the facts and keep hertha in the first division , " friedrich told die zeit .
" when i joined up again with the national team , it was like a liberation . "
freed from any responsibilities larger than keeping a tight ship at the back , friedrich has turned in five fine performances - more than most defenders in south africa can say .
he 's even finally gotten that elusive first goal for the national team .
and he may even get a first world cup title to cap off his unlikely comeback .

international papers , meanwhile , shower germany with praise for what some describe as the team 's best game yet . newspapers and online news sources in argentina show no mercy on sunday in their assessment of germany 's 4-0 blowout of diego maradona 's star-studded team .
" sweat and tears " is the daily sports paper ole 's online headline .
" this time it was worse than being beaten by -lsb- germany -rsb- four years ago because they scored so early and diego -lsb- maradona -rsb- had no answer , " it adds .
la nacion is no less blunt in its analysis : " germany exposed our weaknesses , left us naked .
argentina had no answers in the face of adversity , with neither carlos tevez nor messi at their best . "
the daily clarin says that argentine star lionel messi was used improperly against the " intelligent rival " germany : " he hung back too much for the ball to reach him .
he had a few bursts which gave hope yet the germans had him in their grip pretty much throughout .
he left the tournament without exploding into life or scoring any goals . "
the response from germany : simply madness !
german newspapers on sunday are shimmering with praise for their team .
" unbelievable , unfathomable , impossible to describe in words , " writes the mass-circulated daily bild zeitung .
" the soccer gods have kissed germany : we beat argentina and are playing the best soccer in the whole world !
thank you our heroes ! "
bildunterschrift : millions of germans celebrated their " heroes " after the blowout victory the daily sueddeutsche zeitung writes : " from little cats into lions , " with the german word for lions , loewen , a play on the name of germany coach , joachim loew .
the paper goes on to say : " first 4-1 against england , now 4-0 against argentina .
german soccer has never experienced such a spectacular week . "
one of the capital 's dailies , the berliner tagesspiegel , writes : " simply madness !
what a team , what a tournament !
the entire world is now celebrating german soccer . "
international praise of germany widespread indeed , the international reception of germany 's victory is one of resounding praise .
the dutch daily de volkskrant runs the headline : " the germans chop up argentina in the frying pan , " adding that " joachim loew 's team was just too strong for the south americans led by diego maradona . " in uruguay , who will face the netherlands in the first semifinal on tuesday , the daily el observador writes " germany struck down argentina , hit them with all the forcefulness that comes with a winning score and laid in the open the misery of diego maradona 's team , all the while showing the world that it 's not a casual candidate for winning the world cup in south africa , but rather a serious favorite . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona 's ' dream has died ' , the guardian wrote spain 's el pais also is full of praise for the young german side . " germany crushes the hopes of maradona .
the loew team gives a recital to an argentian side without a midfielder . "
spain will face germany in the second seminfinal on wednesday . le monde in france wraps up the quarterfinals by pointing out that the much favored south american teams did n't live up to pre-tournament expectations and that the world cup is becoming a largely european affair .
" germany-spain and the netherlands-uruguay are the pairs of semi-finals of the world cup in south africa .
the argentine and brazilian favorites have fallen while ghana has entered legend although beaten by uruguay . " the uk 's the guardian 's assessment focuses on diego maradona , argentina 's dejected coach : " if it had indeed been the will of god that argentina should claim this world cup , then maradona must feel utterly abandoned now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch world cup -pipe- 04.07.2010 ' liberated ' veteran arne friedrich is germany 's secret star großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich has been one of the world cup 's best defenders defender arne friedrich was the captain of the worst team in the bundesliga last season .
so why is he suddenly having such a terrific world cup ?
ironically , being out of the spotlight has helped him shine . it may have taken 77 games , but he finally got one .
thirty-one-year-old central defender arne friedrich finally grabbed his first ever goal in german national dress in his side 's surprise 4-0 thrashing of argentina on saturday .
more importantly , though , he anchored a back-four that kept messi , tevez and higuain thoroughly at bay , not allowing the gauchos a single quality look at manuel neuer 's goal .
what 's more , he 's helped germany 's other interior defender , per mertesacker , get through some noticeable wobbles at the start of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : friedrich has picked up the slack for mertesacker " i spoke to him briefly after he came in for criticism , " friedrich said in an interview with the online edition of the german weekly die zeit .
" i told him that i could write a novel about criticism and that i would always be standing beside him on the pitch . "
if anyone had said two weeks ago that friedrich would have been joachim loew 's rock at the back , that person would probably have been put on prescription medications .
as germany headed to south africa , the defender 's place in germany 's starting eleven was anything but sure , and friedrich himself had just been relegated with his former club hertha berlin .
but as friedrich himself has said , not playing for hertha is one key to his renaissance .
bildunterschrift : a dream world cup has followed hertha 's nightmare season the defender , whose manner is usually guarded , has had a lot to say to the german press in the past week .
and the leitmotif has been liberation .
friedrich , the not-so-great " the pressure that i had on me the whole year completely fell away , and i became very relaxed , " friedrich told the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper when asked what it was like coming from relegated hertha to the national team .
after challenging for the bundesliga title in 2008-2009 , hertha plummeted to the bottom of the table early on last season and stayed there .
the inevitable squabbling commenced , and friedrich as captain was able neither to bring the team together nor perform up to speed on the pitch .
friedrich has since transferred to 2008-9 champions wolfsburg .
but the sight of the highly-paid veteran getting nutmegged in front of his own goal became all-too-familiar for hertha devotees .
" i had a very difficult year and played badly in the first half of the season , " friedrich acknowledged in the stadt-anzeiger .
" then i performed better , and we still went down .
as the captain , i was under extreme pressure , and i , too , made mistakes . "
rumors also persist that friedrich was part of a cabal that led to ex-hertha-coach lucien favre getting fired - something friedrich angrily denies .
and that is n't the only bad press that gets friedrich 's gander up .
bildunterschrift : germany 's number 3 was more than a match for stars like tevez although he 's been a fixture in the german national side since 2002 , friedrich has never gotten much love from either fans or the press .
" in 2006 , i also had to take a lot of criticism , " friedrich told die zeit .
" people wrote that i had never been a positive player .
i was never considered a savior , and people said i was just along for the ride … it really ticked me off when people wrote things that were n't true . "
but there was - and is - an element of truth in what was written .
while friedrich is certainly not just along for the ride , he is anything but a natural-born leader .
ahead of the argentina game , while most of the team joked around on the balcony of their hotel in cape town , friedrich was filmed walking alone on the beach staring at the waves .
he himself says he 's not a buddy-buddy sort of player .
" true friendships are very rare in football , " he told die zeit .
that 's about as personal a statement as any journalist is likely to get from the articulate , but wary defender .
and it may explain why , although friedrich is one of only two long-time veterans in the squad , coach joachim loew chose ever-cheerful philipp lahm as his captain and extroverted bastian schweinsteiger as his " on-field leader . "
conversely , friedrich seems to have benefited from being out of the focus - and able to breathe a bit easier .

so why is he suddenly having such a terrific world cup ?
ironically , being out of the spotlight has helped him shine . it may have taken 77 games , but he finally got one .
thirty-one-year-old central defender arne friedrich finally grabbed his first ever goal in german national dress in his side 's surprise 4-0 thrashing of argentina on saturday .
more importantly , though , he anchored a back-four that kept messi , tevez and higuain thoroughly at bay , not allowing the gauchos a single quality look at manuel neuer 's goal .
what 's more , he 's helped germany 's other interior defender , per mertesacker , get through some noticeable wobbles at the start of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : friedrich has picked up the slack for mertesacker " i spoke to him briefly after he came in for criticism , " friedrich said in an interview with the online edition of the german weekly die zeit .
" i told him that i could write a novel about criticism and that i would always be standing beside him on the pitch . "
if anyone had said two weeks ago that friedrich would have been joachim loew 's rock at the back , that person would probably have been put on prescription medications .
as germany headed to south africa , the defender 's place in germany 's starting eleven was anything but sure , and friedrich himself had just been relegated with his former club hertha berlin .
but as friedrich himself has said , not playing for hertha is one key to his renaissance .
bildunterschrift : a dream world cup has followed hertha 's nightmare season the defender , whose manner is usually guarded , has had a lot to say to the german press in the past week .
and the leitmotif has been liberation .
friedrich , the not-so-great " the pressure that i had on me the whole year completely fell away , and i became very relaxed , " friedrich told the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper when asked what it was like coming from relegated hertha to the national team .
after challenging for the bundesliga title in 2008-2009 , hertha plummeted to the bottom of the table early on last season and stayed there .
the inevitable squabbling commenced , and friedrich as captain was able neither to bring the team together nor perform up to speed on the pitch .
friedrich has since transferred to 2008-9 champions wolfsburg .
but the sight of the highly-paid veteran getting nutmegged in front of his own goal became all-too-familiar for hertha devotees .
" i had a very difficult year and played badly in the first half of the season , " friedrich acknowledged in the stadt-anzeiger .
" then i performed better , and we still went down .
as the captain , i was under extreme pressure , and i , too , made mistakes . "
rumors also persist that friedrich was part of a cabal that led to ex-hertha-coach lucien favre getting fired - something friedrich angrily denies .
and that is n't the only bad press that gets friedrich 's gander up .
bildunterschrift : germany 's number 3 was more than a match for stars like tevez although he 's been a fixture in the german national side since 2002 , friedrich has never gotten much love from either fans or the press .
" in 2006 , i also had to take a lot of criticism , " friedrich told die zeit .
" people wrote that i had never been a positive player .
i was never considered a savior , and people said i was just along for the ride … it really ticked me off when people wrote things that were n't true . "
but there was - and is - an element of truth in what was written .
while friedrich is certainly not just along for the ride , he is anything but a natural-born leader .
ahead of the argentina game , while most of the team joked around on the balcony of their hotel in cape town , friedrich was filmed walking alone on the beach staring at the waves .
he himself says he 's not a buddy-buddy sort of player .
" true friendships are very rare in football , " he told die zeit .
that 's about as personal a statement as any journalist is likely to get from the articulate , but wary defender .
and it may explain why , although friedrich is one of only two long-time veterans in the squad , coach joachim loew chose ever-cheerful philipp lahm as his captain and extroverted bastian schweinsteiger as his " on-field leader . "
conversely , friedrich seems to have benefited from being out of the focus - and able to breathe a bit easier .
" unfortunately , i ca n't do anything to change the facts and keep hertha in the first division , " friedrich told die zeit .
" when i joined up again with the national team , it was like a liberation . "
freed from any responsibilities larger than keeping a tight ship at the back , friedrich has turned in five fine performances - more than most defenders in south africa can say .
he 's even finally gotten that elusive first goal for the national team .
and he may even get a first world cup title to cap off his unlikely comeback .

" bavaria became the first german state on sunday to endorse a total smoking ban following a referendum putting an end to smoking in all public buildings .
over three million voters participated in the southern german state 's sixth referendum , with 61 percent voting in favor of the ban , according to the director of state elections .
the citizens ' initiative " for real protection of non-smokers " will impose a total smoking ban on all clubs , bars , restaurants , cafes and beer tents .
the muenchner merkur newspaper on sunday called the vote a " landmark and surprisingly clear " decision .
" few german citizens had trusted the bavarians , often ridiculed as provincial , to show such decisiveness , " the paper said .
emotive issue the referendum was prompted by a heated debate in bavaria , pitting bar owners and restaurant associations against anti-smoking campaigners .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , bavaria 's governing party , had introduced germany 's strongest smoking ban at the beginning of 2008 . but the rules were relaxed a few months later , when the csu formed a state coalition with the free democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's premier seehofer gave up smoking at his wife 's request smoking is currently tolerated in small pubs and side-rooms of taverns , as well as in the oktoberfest 's famed beer tents .
the initiative to restore the original ban was backed by the green party and the social democrats .
the new legislation mandates that smoking will be outlawed in all public buildings beginning august 1 .
the rules will also apply to the oktoberfest , but officials have said that the ban will not be enforced there this year .
bavarian premier horst seehofer told daily tabloid bild preceding the referendum that his ruling csu party could live with either possible result of the referendum .
seehofer told the newspaper that he himself had given up social smoking at his wife 's request .

so why is he suddenly having such a terrific world cup ?
ironically , being out of the spotlight has helped him shine . it may have taken 77 games , but he finally got one .
thirty-one-year-old central defender arne friedrich finally grabbed his first ever goal in german national dress in his side 's surprise 4-0 thrashing of argentina on saturday .
more importantly , though , he anchored a back-four that kept messi , tevez and higuain thoroughly at bay , not allowing the gauchos a single quality look at manuel neuer 's goal .
what 's more , he 's helped germany 's other interior defender , per mertesacker , get through some noticeable wobbles at the start of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : friedrich has picked up the slack for mertesacker " i spoke to him briefly after he came in for criticism , " friedrich said in an interview with the online edition of the german weekly die zeit .
" i told him that i could write a novel about criticism and that i would always be standing beside him on the pitch . "
if anyone had said two weeks ago that friedrich would have been joachim loew 's rock at the back , that person would probably have been put on prescription medications .
as germany headed to south africa , the defender 's place in germany 's starting eleven was anything but sure , and friedrich himself had just been relegated with his former club hertha berlin .
but as friedrich himself has said , not playing for hertha is one key to his renaissance .
bildunterschrift : a dream world cup has followed hertha 's nightmare season the defender , whose manner is usually guarded , has had a lot to say to the german press in the past week .
and the leitmotif has been liberation .
friedrich , the not-so-great " the pressure that i had on me the whole year completely fell away , and i became very relaxed , " friedrich told the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper when asked what it was like coming from relegated hertha to the national team .
after challenging for the bundesliga title in 2008-2009 , hertha plummeted to the bottom of the table early on last season and stayed there .
the inevitable squabbling commenced , and friedrich as captain was able neither to bring the team together nor perform up to speed on the pitch .
friedrich has since transferred to 2008-9 champions wolfsburg .
but the sight of the highly-paid veteran getting nutmegged in front of his own goal became all-too-familiar for hertha devotees .
" i had a very difficult year and played badly in the first half of the season , " friedrich acknowledged in the stadt-anzeiger .
" then i performed better , and we still went down .
as the captain , i was under extreme pressure , and i , too , made mistakes . "
rumors also persist that friedrich was part of a cabal that led to ex-hertha-coach lucien favre getting fired - something friedrich angrily denies .
and that is n't the only bad press that gets friedrich 's gander up .
bildunterschrift : germany 's number 3 was more than a match for stars like tevez although he 's been a fixture in the german national side since 2002 , friedrich has never gotten much love from either fans or the press .
" in 2006 , i also had to take a lot of criticism , " friedrich told die zeit .
" people wrote that i had never been a positive player .
i was never considered a savior , and people said i was just along for the ride … it really ticked me off when people wrote things that were n't true . "
but there was - and is - an element of truth in what was written .
while friedrich is certainly not just along for the ride , he is anything but a natural-born leader .
ahead of the argentina game , while most of the team joked around on the balcony of their hotel in cape town , friedrich was filmed walking alone on the beach staring at the waves .
he himself says he 's not a buddy-buddy sort of player .
" true friendships are very rare in football , " he told die zeit .
that 's about as personal a statement as any journalist is likely to get from the articulate , but wary defender .
and it may explain why , although friedrich is one of only two long-time veterans in the squad , coach joachim loew chose ever-cheerful philipp lahm as his captain and extroverted bastian schweinsteiger as his " on-field leader . "
conversely , friedrich seems to have benefited from being out of the focus - and able to breathe a bit easier .
" unfortunately , i ca n't do anything to change the facts and keep hertha in the first division , " friedrich told die zeit .
" when i joined up again with the national team , it was like a liberation . "
freed from any responsibilities larger than keeping a tight ship at the back , friedrich has turned in five fine performances - more than most defenders in south africa can say .
he 's even finally gotten that elusive first goal for the national team .
and he may even get a first world cup title to cap off his unlikely comeback .

following the full-time whistle , germans ran onto the streets in joy and embraced one another after watching their team roll over an underdone argentina .
others formed up motorcades to tour their cities , waving flags from car windows and honking horns .
joachim loew said there was now real belief his young team could go on to win the trophy for the first time in 20 years .
" we really turned in an incredible showing .
scoring four goals against argentina you just have to say that that was class .
and we closed down -lrb- lionel -rrb- messi very well - without resorting to fouls , so that was great , " said loew .
loew 's men tore apart diego maradona 's argentina , with long-serving striker miroslav klose scoring a brace , center-back arne friedrich enjoying a tap-in and 20-year-old thomas mueller heading in his fourth of the tournament .
the only downside of the game for the germans was that mueller picked up a yellow card late in the first half , meaning he will now miss germany 's semifinal clash with spain on wednesday .
loew said the bayern munich man would be sorely missed .
" the fact that we wo n't have mueller in the semifinal is a serious blow as over the past few matches he has shown how dangerous he is , " loew said .
" i really do n't see why he got booked .
the ball touches his thigh , then touches his arm from a really short distance . "
bildunterschrift : merkel , center-right , said watching the game was ' overwhelming ' spirited performance germany vice captain bastian schweinsteiger , who played an integral role in the quarterfinal win , applauded his teammates for their collective performance .
" we played very well .
i am very proud of the team , " he said .
" the early goal was decisive for us .
we are strong enough to go further .
the team is very young , but what we lack in experience we make up for in audacity and a carefree approach . "
among the 64,000 packed into green point stadium in cape town to cheer on the germans was the country 's leader , chancellor angela merkel , who paid a post-match visit to the players in their dressing room .
mueller said that merkel had told the team that the game had been wonderful .
" she said that she was shivering and shaking with excitement and it was only after the second and third goal that she started to relax and she then turned to south african president jacob zuma , next to whom she was sitting , and said that germany was going to win , " mueller said .
merkel called the victory " overwhelming " and " a dream . "
speaking to zdf television from cape town , merkel said that " germany has done something wonderful today , " adding that " it was overwhelming .
this is a dream , just a dream .
this is a young team but the way they played was very good .
they did n't give argentina much space . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speculation is now rife that maradona will step down from his post much speculation in argentina will now focus on the post-world cup future of diego maradona , who hinted strongly after the loss to germany that he would now quit as head coach .
" i 'm going to be 50 on october 30th , and this is the hardest thing i 've had to go through because i 'm in front of so many good players and good people , " he said at the post-match press conference .
" it 's like a knock-out punch from muhammad ali , and i do n't have the strength to do anything .
it was n't the ending we 'd hoped for , but i believe that whoever comes in next will have to continue on the same path because it 's the path the argentines want . "
meanwhile , the argentine press focused their attention on germany 's " steamroller " performance .
" germany laid bare all the deficiencies of the argentine side which , with neither carlos tevez , messi or -lrb- gonzalo -rrb- higuain at their best , had no answers in the face of adversity , " wrote la nacion daily .
" argentina had a bad time of it and left the world cup stage on the end of a thrashing from a german steamroller , " was the assessment of the infobae news website .
the daily clarin argued that lionel messi had not been used properly and was played too deep .
" he hung back too much for the ball to reach him .
he had a few bursts , which gave hope , yet the germans had him in their grip pretty much throughout .
he left the tournament without exploding into life or scoring any goals , " was the paper 's assessment .

following the full-time whistle , germans ran onto the streets in joy and embraced one another after watching their team roll over an underdone argentina .
others formed up motorcades to tour their cities , waving flags from car windows and honking horns .
joachim loew said there was now real belief his young team could go on to win the trophy for the first time in 20 years .
" we really turned in an incredible showing .
scoring four goals against argentina you just have to say that that was class .
and we closed down -lrb- lionel -rrb- messi very well - without resorting to fouls , so that was great , " said loew .
loew 's men tore apart diego maradona 's argentina , with long-serving striker miroslav klose scoring a brace , center-back arne friedrich enjoying a tap-in and 20-year-old thomas mueller heading in his fourth of the tournament .
the only downside of the game for the germans was that mueller picked up a yellow card late in the first half , meaning he will now miss germany 's semifinal clash with spain on wednesday .
loew said the bayern munich man would be sorely missed .
" the fact that we wo n't have mueller in the semifinal is a serious blow as over the past few matches he has shown how dangerous he is , " loew said .
" i really do n't see why he got booked .
the ball touches his thigh , then touches his arm from a really short distance . "
bildunterschrift : merkel , center-right , said watching the game was ' overwhelming ' spirited performance germany vice captain bastian schweinsteiger , who played an integral role in the quarterfinal win , applauded his teammates for their collective performance .
" we played very well .
i am very proud of the team , " he said .
" the early goal was decisive for us .
we are strong enough to go further .
the team is very young , but what we lack in experience we make up for in audacity and a carefree approach . "
among the 64,000 packed into green point stadium in cape town to cheer on the germans was the country 's leader , chancellor angela merkel , who paid a post-match visit to the players in their dressing room .
mueller said that merkel had told the team that the game had been wonderful .
" she said that she was shivering and shaking with excitement and it was only after the second and third goal that she started to relax and she then turned to south african president jacob zuma , next to whom she was sitting , and said that germany was going to win , " mueller said .
merkel called the victory " overwhelming " and " a dream . "
speaking to zdf television from cape town , merkel said that " germany has done something wonderful today , " adding that " it was overwhelming .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speculation is now rife that maradona will step down from his post much speculation in argentina will now focus on the post-world cup future of diego maradona , who hinted strongly after the loss to germany that he would now quit as head coach .
" i 'm going to be 50 on october 30th , and this is the hardest thing i 've had to go through because i 'm in front of so many good players and good people , " he said at the post-match press conference .
" it 's like a knock-out punch from muhammad ali , and i do n't have the strength to do anything .
it was n't the ending we 'd hoped for , but i believe that whoever comes in next will have to continue on the same path because it 's the path the argentines want . "
meanwhile , the argentine press focused their attention on germany 's " steamroller " performance .
" germany laid bare all the deficiencies of the argentine side which , with neither carlos tevez , messi or -lrb- gonzalo -rrb- higuain at their best , had no answers in the face of adversity , " wrote la nacion daily .
" argentina had a bad time of it and left the world cup stage on the end of a thrashing from a german steamroller , " was the assessment of the infobae news website .
the daily clarin argued that lionel messi had not been used properly and was played too deep .
" he hung back too much for the ball to reach him .
he had a few bursts , which gave hope , yet the germans had him in their grip pretty much throughout .
he left the tournament without exploding into life or scoring any goals , " was the paper 's assessment .

" bavaria became the first german state on sunday to endorse a total smoking ban following a referendum putting an end to smoking in all public buildings .
over three million voters participated in the southern german state 's sixth referendum , with 61 percent voting in favor of the ban , according to the director of state elections .
the citizens ' initiative " for real protection of non-smokers " will impose a total smoking ban on all clubs , bars , restaurants , cafes and beer tents .
the muenchner merkur newspaper on sunday called the vote a " landmark and surprisingly clear " decision .
" few german citizens had trusted the bavarians , often ridiculed as provincial , to show such decisiveness , " the paper said .
emotive issue the referendum was prompted by a heated debate in bavaria , pitting bar owners and restaurant associations against anti-smoking campaigners .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , bavaria 's governing party , had introduced germany 's strongest smoking ban at the beginning of 2008 . but the rules were relaxed a few months later , when the csu formed a state coalition with the free democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's premier seehofer gave up smoking at his wife 's request smoking is currently tolerated in small pubs and side-rooms of taverns , as well as in the oktoberfest 's famed beer tents .
the initiative to restore the original ban was backed by the green party and the social democrats .
the new legislation mandates that smoking will be outlawed in all public buildings beginning august 1 .
the rules will also apply to the oktoberfest , but officials have said that the ban will not be enforced there this year .
bavarian premier horst seehofer told daily tabloid bild preceding the referendum that his ruling csu party could live with either possible result of the referendum .
seehofer told the newspaper that he himself had given up social smoking at his wife 's request .

international papers , meanwhile , shower germany with praise for what some describe as the team 's best game yet . newspapers and online news sources in argentina show no mercy on sunday in their assessment of germany 's 4-0 blowout of diego maradona 's star-studded team .
" sweat and tears " is the daily sports paper ole 's online headline .
" this time it was worse than being beaten by -lsb- germany -rsb- four years ago because they scored so early and diego -lsb- maradona -rsb- had no answer , " it adds .
la nacion is no less blunt in its analysis : " germany exposed our weaknesses , left us naked .
argentina had no answers in the face of adversity , with neither carlos tevez nor messi at their best . "
the daily clarin says that argentine star lionel messi was used improperly against the " intelligent rival " germany : " he hung back too much for the ball to reach him .
he had a few bursts which gave hope yet the germans had him in their grip pretty much throughout .
he left the tournament without exploding into life or scoring any goals . "
the response from germany : simply madness !
german newspapers on sunday are shimmering with praise for their team .
" unbelievable , unfathomable , impossible to describe in words , " writes the mass-circulated daily bild zeitung .
" the soccer gods have kissed germany : we beat argentina and are playing the best soccer in the whole world !
thank you our heroes ! "
bildunterschrift : millions of germans celebrated their " heroes " after the blowout victory the daily sueddeutsche zeitung writes : " from little cats into lions , " with the german word for lions , loewen , a play on the name of germany coach , joachim loew .
the paper goes on to say : " first 4-1 against england , now 4-0 against argentina .
german soccer has never experienced such a spectacular week . "
one of the capital 's dailies , the berliner tagesspiegel , writes : " simply madness !
what a team , what a tournament !
the entire world is now celebrating german soccer . "
international praise of germany widespread indeed , the international reception of germany 's victory is one of resounding praise .
the dutch daily de volkskrant runs the headline : " the germans chop up argentina in the frying pan , " adding that " joachim loew 's team was just too strong for the south americans led by diego maradona . " in uruguay , who will face the netherlands in the first semifinal on tuesday , the daily el observador writes " germany struck down argentina , hit them with all the forcefulness that comes with a winning score and laid in the open the misery of diego maradona 's team , all the while showing the world that it 's not a casual candidate for winning the world cup in south africa , but rather a serious favorite . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona 's ' dream has died ' , the guardian wrote spain 's el pais also is full of praise for the young german side . " germany crushes the hopes of maradona .
the loew team gives a recital to an argentian side without a midfielder . "
spain will face germany in the second seminfinal on wednesday . le monde in france wraps up the quarterfinals by pointing out that the much favored south american teams did n't live up to pre-tournament expectations and that the world cup is becoming a largely european affair .
" germany-spain and the netherlands-uruguay are the pairs of semi-finals of the world cup in south africa .
the argentine and brazilian favorites have fallen while ghana has entered legend although beaten by uruguay . " the uk 's the guardian 's assessment focuses on diego maradona , argentina 's dejected coach : " if it had indeed been the will of god that argentina should claim this world cup , then maradona must feel utterly abandoned now .
this was a slaughter to leave el diego numbed and close to tears on the touchline .
his dream has died . " compiled by gabriel borrud editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch world cup -pipe- 04.07.2010 ' liberated ' veteran arne friedrich is germany 's secret star großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich has been one of the world cup 's best defenders defender arne friedrich was the captain of the worst team in the bundesliga last season .
so why is he suddenly having such a terrific world cup ?
ironically , being out of the spotlight has helped him shine . it may have taken 77 games , but he finally got one .
thirty-one-year-old central defender arne friedrich finally grabbed his first ever goal in german national dress in his side 's surprise 4-0 thrashing of argentina on saturday .
more importantly , though , he anchored a back-four that kept messi , tevez and higuain thoroughly at bay , not allowing the gauchos a single quality look at manuel neuer 's goal .
what 's more , he 's helped germany 's other interior defender , per mertesacker , get through some noticeable wobbles at the start of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : friedrich has picked up the slack for mertesacker " i spoke to him briefly after he came in for criticism , " friedrich said in an interview with the online edition of the german weekly die zeit .
" i told him that i could write a novel about criticism and that i would always be standing beside him on the pitch . "
if anyone had said two weeks ago that friedrich would have been joachim loew 's rock at the back , that person would probably have been put on prescription medications .
as germany headed to south africa , the defender 's place in germany 's starting eleven was anything but sure , and friedrich himself had just been relegated with his former club hertha berlin .
but as friedrich himself has said , not playing for hertha is one key to his renaissance .
bildunterschrift : a dream world cup has followed hertha 's nightmare season the defender , whose manner is usually guarded , has had a lot to say to the german press in the past week .
and the leitmotif has been liberation .
friedrich , the not-so-great " the pressure that i had on me the whole year completely fell away , and i became very relaxed , " friedrich told the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper when asked what it was like coming from relegated hertha to the national team .
after challenging for the bundesliga title in 2008-2009 , hertha plummeted to the bottom of the table early on last season and stayed there .
the inevitable squabbling commenced , and friedrich as captain was able neither to bring the team together nor perform up to speed on the pitch .
friedrich has since transferred to 2008-9 champions wolfsburg .
but the sight of the highly-paid veteran getting nutmegged in front of his own goal became all-too-familiar for hertha devotees .
" i had a very difficult year and played badly in the first half of the season , " friedrich acknowledged in the stadt-anzeiger .
" then i performed better , and we still went down .
as the captain , i was under extreme pressure , and i , too , made mistakes . "
rumors also persist that friedrich was part of a cabal that led to ex-hertha-coach lucien favre getting fired - something friedrich angrily denies .
and that is n't the only bad press that gets friedrich 's gander up .
bildunterschrift : germany 's number 3 was more than a match for stars like tevez although he 's been a fixture in the german national side since 2002 , friedrich has never gotten much love from either fans or the press .
" in 2006 , i also had to take a lot of criticism , " friedrich told die zeit .
" people wrote that i had never been a positive player .
i was never considered a savior , and people said i was just along for the ride … it really ticked me off when people wrote things that were n't true . "
but there was - and is - an element of truth in what was written .
while friedrich is certainly not just along for the ride , he is anything but a natural-born leader .
ahead of the argentina game , while most of the team joked around on the balcony of their hotel in cape town , friedrich was filmed walking alone on the beach staring at the waves .
he himself says he 's not a buddy-buddy sort of player .
" true friendships are very rare in football , " he told die zeit .
that 's about as personal a statement as any journalist is likely to get from the articulate , but wary defender .
and it may explain why , although friedrich is one of only two long-time veterans in the squad , coach joachim loew chose ever-cheerful philipp lahm as his captain and extroverted bastian schweinsteiger as his " on-field leader . "
conversely , friedrich seems to have benefited from being out of the focus - and able to breathe a bit easier .
" unfortunately , i ca n't do anything to change the facts and keep hertha in the first division , " friedrich told die zeit .
" when i joined up again with the national team , it was like a liberation . "
freed from any responsibilities larger than keeping a tight ship at the back , friedrich has turned in five fine performances - more than most defenders in south africa can say .
he 's even finally gotten that elusive first goal for the national team .
and he may even get a first world cup title to cap off his unlikely comeback .

so why is he suddenly having such a terrific world cup ?
ironically , being out of the spotlight has helped him shine . it may have taken 77 games , but he finally got one .
thirty-one-year-old central defender arne friedrich finally grabbed his first ever goal in german national dress in his side 's surprise 4-0 thrashing of argentina on saturday .
more importantly , though , he anchored a back-four that kept messi , tevez and higuain thoroughly at bay , not allowing the gauchos a single quality look at manuel neuer 's goal .
what 's more , he 's helped germany 's other interior defender , per mertesacker , get through some noticeable wobbles at the start of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : friedrich has picked up the slack for mertesacker " i spoke to him briefly after he came in for criticism , " friedrich said in an interview with the online edition of the german weekly die zeit .
" i told him that i could write a novel about criticism and that i would always be standing beside him on the pitch . "
if anyone had said two weeks ago that friedrich would have been joachim loew 's rock at the back , that person would probably have been put on prescription medications .
as germany headed to south africa , the defender 's place in germany 's starting eleven was anything but sure , and friedrich himself had just been relegated with his former club hertha berlin .
but as friedrich himself has said , not playing for hertha is one key to his renaissance .
bildunterschrift : a dream world cup has followed hertha 's nightmare season the defender , whose manner is usually guarded , has had a lot to say to the german press in the past week .
and the leitmotif has been liberation .
friedrich , the not-so-great " the pressure that i had on me the whole year completely fell away , and i became very relaxed , " friedrich told the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper when asked what it was like coming from relegated hertha to the national team .
after challenging for the bundesliga title in 2008-2009 , hertha plummeted to the bottom of the table early on last season and stayed there .
the inevitable squabbling commenced , and friedrich as captain was able neither to bring the team together nor perform up to speed on the pitch .
friedrich has since transferred to 2008-9 champions wolfsburg .
but the sight of the highly-paid veteran getting nutmegged in front of his own goal became all-too-familiar for hertha devotees .
" i had a very difficult year and played badly in the first half of the season , " friedrich acknowledged in the stadt-anzeiger .
" then i performed better , and we still went down .
as the captain , i was under extreme pressure , and i , too , made mistakes . "
rumors also persist that friedrich was part of a cabal that led to ex-hertha-coach lucien favre getting fired - something friedrich angrily denies .
and that is n't the only bad press that gets friedrich 's gander up .
bildunterschrift : germany 's number 3 was more than a match for stars like tevez although he 's been a fixture in the german national side since 2002 , friedrich has never gotten much love from either fans or the press .
" in 2006 , i also had to take a lot of criticism , " friedrich told die zeit .
" people wrote that i had never been a positive player .
i was never considered a savior , and people said i was just along for the ride … it really ticked me off when people wrote things that were n't true . "
but there was - and is - an element of truth in what was written .
while friedrich is certainly not just along for the ride , he is anything but a natural-born leader .
ahead of the argentina game , while most of the team joked around on the balcony of their hotel in cape town , friedrich was filmed walking alone on the beach staring at the waves .
he himself says he 's not a buddy-buddy sort of player .
" true friendships are very rare in football , " he told die zeit .
that 's about as personal a statement as any journalist is likely to get from the articulate , but wary defender .
and it may explain why , although friedrich is one of only two long-time veterans in the squad , coach joachim loew chose ever-cheerful philipp lahm as his captain and extroverted bastian schweinsteiger as his " on-field leader . "
conversely , friedrich seems to have benefited from being out of the focus - and able to breathe a bit easier .
" unfortunately , i ca n't do anything to change the facts and keep hertha in the first division , " friedrich told die zeit .
" when i joined up again with the national team , it was like a liberation . "
freed from any responsibilities larger than keeping a tight ship at the back , friedrich has turned in five fine performances - more than most defenders in south africa can say .
he 's even finally gotten that elusive first goal for the national team .
and he may even get a first world cup title to cap off his unlikely comeback .

international papers , meanwhile , shower germany with praise for what some describe as the team 's best game yet . newspapers and online news sources in argentina show no mercy on sunday in their assessment of germany 's 4-0 blowout of diego maradona 's star-studded team .
" sweat and tears " is the daily sports paper ole 's online headline .
" this time it was worse than being beaten by -lsb- germany -rsb- four years ago because they scored so early and diego -lsb- maradona -rsb- had no answer , " it adds .
la nacion is no less blunt in its analysis : " germany exposed our weaknesses , left us naked .
argentina had no answers in the face of adversity , with neither carlos tevez nor messi at their best . "
the daily clarin says that argentine star lionel messi was used improperly against the " intelligent rival " germany : " he hung back too much for the ball to reach him .
he had a few bursts which gave hope yet the germans had him in their grip pretty much throughout .
he left the tournament without exploding into life or scoring any goals . "
the response from germany : simply madness !
german newspapers on sunday are shimmering with praise for their team .
" unbelievable , unfathomable , impossible to describe in words , " writes the mass-circulated daily bild zeitung .
" the soccer gods have kissed germany : we beat argentina and are playing the best soccer in the whole world !
thank you our heroes ! "
bildunterschrift : millions of germans celebrated their " heroes " after the blowout victory the daily sueddeutsche zeitung writes : " from little cats into lions , " with the german word for lions , loewen , a play on the name of germany coach , joachim loew .
the paper goes on to say : " first 4-1 against england , now 4-0 against argentina .
german soccer has never experienced such a spectacular week . "
one of the capital 's dailies , the berliner tagesspiegel , writes : " simply madness !
what a team , what a tournament !
the entire world is now celebrating german soccer . "
international praise of germany widespread indeed , the international reception of germany 's victory is one of resounding praise .
the dutch daily de volkskrant runs the headline : " the germans chop up argentina in the frying pan , " adding that " joachim loew 's team was just too strong for the south americans led by diego maradona . " in uruguay , who will face the netherlands in the first semifinal on tuesday , the daily el observador writes " germany struck down argentina , hit them with all the forcefulness that comes with a winning score and laid in the open the misery of diego maradona 's team , all the while showing the world that it 's not a casual candidate for winning the world cup in south africa , but rather a serious favorite . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona 's ' dream has died ' , the guardian wrote spain 's el pais also is full of praise for the young german side . " germany crushes the hopes of maradona .
the loew team gives a recital to an argentian side without a midfielder . "
spain will face germany in the second seminfinal on wednesday . le monde in france wraps up the quarterfinals by pointing out that the much favored south american teams did n't live up to pre-tournament expectations and that the world cup is becoming a largely european affair .
" germany-spain and the netherlands-uruguay are the pairs of semi-finals of the world cup in south africa .
the argentine and brazilian favorites have fallen while ghana has entered legend although beaten by uruguay . " the uk 's the guardian 's assessment focuses on diego maradona , argentina 's dejected coach : " if it had indeed been the will of god that argentina should claim this world cup , then maradona must feel utterly abandoned now .

" bavaria became the first german state on sunday to endorse a total smoking ban following a referendum putting an end to smoking in all public buildings .
over three million voters participated in the southern german state 's sixth referendum , with 61 percent voting in favor of the ban , according to the director of state elections .
the citizens ' initiative " for real protection of non-smokers " will impose a total smoking ban on all clubs , bars , restaurants , cafes and beer tents .
the muenchner merkur newspaper on sunday called the vote a " landmark and surprisingly clear " decision .
" few german citizens had trusted the bavarians , often ridiculed as provincial , to show such decisiveness , " the paper said .
emotive issue the referendum was prompted by a heated debate in bavaria , pitting bar owners and restaurant associations against anti-smoking campaigners .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , bavaria 's governing party , had introduced germany 's strongest smoking ban at the beginning of 2008 . but the rules were relaxed a few months later , when the csu formed a state coalition with the free democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's premier seehofer gave up smoking at his wife 's request smoking is currently tolerated in small pubs and side-rooms of taverns , as well as in the oktoberfest 's famed beer tents .
the initiative to restore the original ban was backed by the green party and the social democrats .
the new legislation mandates that smoking will be outlawed in all public buildings beginning august 1 .
the rules will also apply to the oktoberfest , but officials have said that the ban will not be enforced there this year .
bavarian premier horst seehofer told daily tabloid bild preceding the referendum that his ruling csu party could live with either possible result of the referendum .
seehofer told the newspaper that he himself had given up social smoking at his wife 's request .

human rights groups continue to document military abuse against workers there . the controversy surrounding zimbabwe 's marange diamond fields could not be resolved at a conference of the un-backed kimberley process -lrb- kp -rrb- , which regulates the worldwide trade of conflict diamonds .
delegates at the recent kp meeting in tel aviv failed to reach a consensus on whether to allow zimbabwe to resume exporting marange diamonds .
the kp withdrew certification of the fields last november after its investigators documented forced labor , beatings and other abuses by the military against civilians working in the diamond fields .
human rights groups have called for zimbabwe to be suspended from the kp , saying it had not fulfilled its promise made last year to improve conditions at its marange fields .
" the controversial marange diamond fields have seen and continue to see quite a high level of human rights abuses and the militarization of mining , " annie dunnebacke , a campaigner at the non-governmental organization global witness , told deutsche welle .
global witness focuses its work on natural-resource related conflicts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small percentage of these raw diamonds are of gem quality a report by kp investigator abbey chikane presented at the tel aviv conference argued that president robert mugabe 's government had met the regulator 's criteria in respect to the marange diamond fields .
but human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- has received new reports that soldiers are engaging in forced labor , torture , beatings and harassment in the marange diamond fields around chiadzwa , 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- east of the zimbabwean capital harare .
" it baffles us why chikane would say exportation should go ahead because there 's still smuggling in the fields , and the army has not been removed , " said tiseke kasambala , senior researcher in hrw 's africa division .
" we are still seeing forced labor , beatings and torture , and the sexual assault of women , " kasambala told deutsche welle .
" that is something that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency by the government of zimbabwe and by the kp . "
africa 's role the european union in a statement urged members of the certification scheme to put greater pressure on zimbabwe to improve the situation of mine workers to meet the minimum standards set out by the kp .
it followed on the heels of a us appeal .
philip crowley , a spokesman for the us state department , said that washington was " disappointed " that consensus was not reached in tel aviv .
" it is important that zimbabwe address the ongoing diamond smuggling and human rights violations in and around the marange diamond fields , " crowley told reporters .
bildunterschrift : women in the marange fields are often victims of violence and abuse by the security forces but while every participant involved in the kp had a role to play in urging the government to take its responsibilities seriously , it was zimbabwe 's neighboring countries which could have the most clout , dunnebacke said .
" other african nations , including south africa , have an extremely important role to play in pushing the authorities in zimbabwe toward compliance , " she said .
" the kimberley process is incredibly important for all african diamond-producing countries . "
the certification scheme had helped to bring more official diamond revenues to countries such as the democratic republic of congo and angola , as well as reduce smuggling , she said .
" it has given international credibility and legitimacy to the diamond trade , " dunnebacke said .
" it would be terrible for these african countries if the kimberley process was compromised and it 's up to those governments to put pressure on zimbabwe and to say , look , cut it out .
you 've got to play by the rules like the rest of us are trying to do . "
kasambala , however , said she felt the only remaining avenue to put pressure on the government of zimbabwe was the kp itself .
key governments within the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- , such as south africa , could exert great pressure .
but it was more concerned with zimbabwe as a whole .
south africa had been instrumental in helping establish a fragile power-sharing government between president robert mugabe and opposition politician morgan tsvangirai , now prime minister , of the movement for democratic change .
" sadc governments are more interested in the bigger picture and not necessarily in what 's going on in the marange diamond fields , " kasambala said .
" so the kp seems to be the sole organization that can put political pressure on the government of zimbabwe to improve the situation there . "
exports to go ahead the zimbabwean government does not appear to be feeling any pressure , though .
according to the state-controlled daily newspaper , the herald , the government has said it will immediately begin selling marange diamonds on the international market .
zimbabwe 's minister of mines obert mpofu had already made this intention clear at the meeting in tel aviv .
mpofu had also belittled the role of ngos in the kp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blood diamonds from zimbabwe continue to find their way into jewelry stores worldwide " the attitude the zimbabwean authorities have shown to the kimberley process over the past 18 months has been difficult - to put it mildly , " said dunnebacke , who attended the kp conference .
" we have n't always seen a high level of commitment or interest in respecting the rules and being compliant with kimberley process requirements . "
however , zimbabwe may have difficulties finding legal buyers for the gems until the kp reaches a consensus .
its 49 members , representing 75 countries , have agreed to only buy diamonds certified as " conflict-free . "
securing political power human rights organizations are now concerned that mugabe and his powerful party zanu-pf could use the funds from the fields to tighten their grip on power .
" the security forces that have been committing abuses in the marange diamond fields answer to zanu-pf , " said kasambala , who also attended the kp conference .
" a key arm of this government of national unity is benefitting from smuggling in those diamond fields and is likely to use the revenue to commit further abuses , perhaps even during the next elections in zimbabwe .
that is what we 're warning about . "
the marange fields are regarded as the wealthiest diamond find in the world in a century .
the potential revenue for zimbabwe from the area is estimated to run at $ 1 billion -lrb- 0.8 billion euros -rrb- to $ 1.7 billion per year .
" there is very much concern that revenues from marange are not going into state coffers , toward the unity government or development , but are going toward certain elite within the zanu-pf and could be used for political violence at some point in the near future , " dunnebacke said .
the detention of a prominent human rights activist at the beginning of june illustrates the importance of this new-found wealth for the zanu-pf .
authorities arrested farai maguwu , the director of the center for research and development in eastern zimbabwe , after he met with chikane and briefed him on the human rights violations in the marange mines .
" essentially he 's in prison because his ngo has been documenting and reporting on the abuses in the marange diamond fields , " dunnebacke said .
though human rights groups , the eu and the us have condemned maguwu 's arrest , zimbabwean authorities refuse to release him on bail .
kp talks are due to resume on july 14 and 15 in st. petersburg , russia .

" bavaria became the first german state on sunday to endorse a total smoking ban following a referendum putting an end to smoking in all public buildings .
over three million voters participated in the southern german state 's sixth referendum , with 61 percent voting in favor of the ban , according to the director of state elections .
the citizens ' initiative " for real protection of non-smokers " will impose a total smoking ban on all clubs , bars , restaurants , cafes and beer tents .
the muenchner merkur newspaper on sunday called the vote a " landmark and surprisingly clear " decision .
" few german citizens had trusted the bavarians , often ridiculed as provincial , to show such decisiveness , " the paper said .
emotive issue the referendum was prompted by a heated debate in bavaria , pitting bar owners and restaurant associations against anti-smoking campaigners .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , bavaria 's governing party , had introduced germany 's strongest smoking ban at the beginning of 2008 . but the rules were relaxed a few months later , when the csu formed a state coalition with the free democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's premier seehofer gave up smoking at his wife 's request smoking is currently tolerated in small pubs and side-rooms of taverns , as well as in the oktoberfest 's famed beer tents .
the initiative to restore the original ban was backed by the green party and the social democrats .
the new legislation mandates that smoking will be outlawed in all public buildings beginning august 1 .
the rules will also apply to the oktoberfest , but officials have said that the ban will not be enforced there this year .
bavarian premier horst seehofer told daily tabloid bild preceding the referendum that his ruling csu party could live with either possible result of the referendum .
seehofer told the newspaper that he himself had given up social smoking at his wife 's request .

global witness focuses its work on natural-resource related conflicts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a small percentage of these raw diamonds are of gem quality a report by kp investigator abbey chikane presented at the tel aviv conference argued that president robert mugabe 's government had met the regulator 's criteria in respect to the marange diamond fields .
but human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- has received new reports that soldiers are engaging in forced labor , torture , beatings and harassment in the marange diamond fields around chiadzwa , 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- east of the zimbabwean capital harare .
" it baffles us why chikane would say exportation should go ahead because there 's still smuggling in the fields , and the army has not been removed , " said tiseke kasambala , senior researcher in hrw 's africa division .
" we are still seeing forced labor , beatings and torture , and the sexual assault of women , " kasambala told deutsche welle .
" that is something that needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency by the government of zimbabwe and by the kp . "
africa 's role the european union in a statement urged members of the certification scheme to put greater pressure on zimbabwe to improve the situation of mine workers to meet the minimum standards set out by the kp .
it followed on the heels of a us appeal .
philip crowley , a spokesman for the us state department , said that washington was " disappointed " that consensus was not reached in tel aviv .
" it is important that zimbabwe address the ongoing diamond smuggling and human rights violations in and around the marange diamond fields , " crowley told reporters .
bildunterschrift : women in the marange fields are often victims of violence and abuse by the security forces but while every participant involved in the kp had a role to play in urging the government to take its responsibilities seriously , it was zimbabwe 's neighboring countries which could have the most clout , dunnebacke said .
" other african nations , including south africa , have an extremely important role to play in pushing the authorities in zimbabwe toward compliance , " she said .
" the kimberley process is incredibly important for all african diamond-producing countries . "
the certification scheme had helped to bring more official diamond revenues to countries such as the democratic republic of congo and angola , as well as reduce smuggling , she said .
" it has given international credibility and legitimacy to the diamond trade , " dunnebacke said .
" it would be terrible for these african countries if the kimberley process was compromised and it 's up to those governments to put pressure on zimbabwe and to say , look , cut it out .
you 've got to play by the rules like the rest of us are trying to do . "
kasambala , however , said she felt the only remaining avenue to put pressure on the government of zimbabwe was the kp itself .
key governments within the southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- , such as south africa , could exert great pressure .
but it was more concerned with zimbabwe as a whole .
south africa had been instrumental in helping establish a fragile power-sharing government between president robert mugabe and opposition politician morgan tsvangirai , now prime minister , of the movement for democratic change .
" sadc governments are more interested in the bigger picture and not necessarily in what 's going on in the marange diamond fields , " kasambala said .
" so the kp seems to be the sole organization that can put political pressure on the government of zimbabwe to improve the situation there . "
exports to go ahead the zimbabwean government does not appear to be feeling any pressure , though .
according to the state-controlled daily newspaper , the herald , the government has said it will immediately begin selling marange diamonds on the international market .
zimbabwe 's minister of mines obert mpofu had already made this intention clear at the meeting in tel aviv .
mpofu had also belittled the role of ngos in the kp .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blood diamonds from zimbabwe continue to find their way into jewelry stores worldwide " the attitude the zimbabwean authorities have shown to the kimberley process over the past 18 months has been difficult - to put it mildly , " said dunnebacke , who attended the kp conference .
" we have n't always seen a high level of commitment or interest in respecting the rules and being compliant with kimberley process requirements . "
however , zimbabwe may have difficulties finding legal buyers for the gems until the kp reaches a consensus .
its 49 members , representing 75 countries , have agreed to only buy diamonds certified as " conflict-free . "
securing political power human rights organizations are now concerned that mugabe and his powerful party zanu-pf could use the funds from the fields to tighten their grip on power .
" the security forces that have been committing abuses in the marange diamond fields answer to zanu-pf , " said kasambala , who also attended the kp conference .
" a key arm of this government of national unity is benefitting from smuggling in those diamond fields and is likely to use the revenue to commit further abuses , perhaps even during the next elections in zimbabwe .
that is what we 're warning about . "
the marange fields are regarded as the wealthiest diamond find in the world in a century .
the potential revenue for zimbabwe from the area is estimated to run at $ 1 billion -lrb- 0.8 billion euros -rrb- to $ 1.7 billion per year .
" there is very much concern that revenues from marange are not going into state coffers , toward the unity government or development , but are going toward certain elite within the zanu-pf and could be used for political violence at some point in the near future , " dunnebacke said .
the detention of a prominent human rights activist at the beginning of june illustrates the importance of this new-found wealth for the zanu-pf .
authorities arrested farai maguwu , the director of the center for research and development in eastern zimbabwe , after he met with chikane and briefed him on the human rights violations in the marange mines .
" essentially he 's in prison because his ngo has been documenting and reporting on the abuses in the marange diamond fields , " dunnebacke said .
though human rights groups , the eu and the us have condemned maguwu 's arrest , zimbabwean authorities refuse to release him on bail .
kp talks are due to resume on july 14 and 15 in st. petersburg , russia .

at a training center in accra , ghana , tomorrow 's peacekeepers are getting the preparation they need - with help from germany . a tense silence fell over an auditorium in ghana 's capital city , as haunting scenes from a documentary on sierra leone 's civil war flashed across the screen .
this film screening marked the start of a two-week crash course in peacekeeping for 90 police officers from around africa .
these men and women were scheduled for deployment to darfur as part of the united nations african union hybrid mission in darfur , or unamid .
to prepare them for their mission , the group received training here , at the kofi annan international peacekeeping training center , or kaiptc .
one of the trainers of the current class was fanny aboadje .
the young ghanaian police officer recently returned from an 18-month posting in darfur . she had gone through a training course at kaiptc herself before going on her mission . " darfur is a very complex and complicated mission , and so the training kind of helps you to settle down , and to know what you are about , " she said . " if you compare us to other officers who probably did n't have any training there were lots of gaps . "
first-hand experience is invaluable in training future peacekeepers , according to colonel leo hirschmann , who heads the training department at the kaiptc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonel leo hirschmann heads kaiptc 's training department " in an ideal setup , we send a student who has participated in the preparatory training to the particular region we prepared him for , " he said .
" and when he returns from that mission , he 's available for us as a facilitator . "
trainers are able to pass on their impressions of the mission to participants in the preparatory course - while the experiences are still fresh in their minds .
gerhard schroeder hall at the center of things as the program 's main sponsor , germany has played an instrumental role in establishing the kaiptc and has provided some 10 million euros in funding for the center so far .
when kaiptc opened in january 2004 , even then-german chancellor gerhard schroeder was on hand to mark the occasion .
today , the auditorium that houses training sessions bears his name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kaiptc facility has trained several thousand participants the center stands on a site about the size of five soccer fields , not far from the atlantic coast .
blue buildings stretch skyward under the tropical sun .
with its well-groomed grass pitches , the center looks like a cross between a training center and military barracks .
the equipment is state of the art , featuring high-speed computers , a first-class canteen and a gym that trainees can use to stay fit .
almost 6,000 participants from more than 70 countries have participated in some 170 courses offered by the kaiptc since 2004 .
these two-week training courses for police put human rights , protection of women , and basic medical knowledge at the top of the agenda .
trainees can also participate in practical exercises , from role playing to driving instruction .
the latter course is designed to prepare participants for more than just road blocks and attacks : 80 percent of accidents that occur during peace missions are , in fact , traffic-related .
uniform fear policemen and -women must also be mindful of how they are perceived by people living in war-ravaged areas .
refugees , in particular , often have painful associations when it comes to officers in uniform .
amadu fofana , a kaiptc facilitator from mali , said trainees must keep this in mind when dealing with people they meet during their mission .
fofana visited the center to share his experiences from darfur , where he was posted for two years .
during his time there , he worked in communities where policemen had previously committed acts of rape and unprovoked attacks .
" the population loses all confidence with the police , " fofana said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many refugees have lost faith in the authorities fanny aboadje said the reality for peacekeepers on the ground often varies from place to place .
before her posting in darfur , she was stationed in east timor , a country in southeast asia .
she says one of the biggest problems facing the unamid forces in darfur is communication .
" in east timor , it looks to me that the people - the civilians - understood the role of the un , " she said .
" but in darfur , it looks to be that they do n't know why we are there , for various reasons .
so communication to get them to understand your mandates and your mission is very difficult . "
working toward conflict prevention communication is also a key discussion topic back at the training center , where 30 participants from across africa are learning about the art of negotiation .
this course was developed by kaiptc 's research department .
" our main objective is to give basic mediation and negotiation skills to them so that they can apply them in resolving basic conflicts that come up during peacekeeping operations , " said samuel atuabi , who works in the research department .
the team is instrumental in shaping the second main focus of the kaiptc : conflict prevention .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most trainers at the kaiptc have just returned from peacekeeping missions in addition to the kaiptc , there are six peacekeeper training centers in africa .
ghana has participated in peacekeeping missions since the 1960s .
a local kaiptc chapter was launched in 1998 to take advantage of more than four decades ' worth of collective experiences .
each year , much of the ghanaian army is involved in peacekeeping missions abroad .
there are also financial incentives : soldiers and police officers themselves are enthusiastic participants in the peace missions – in part because they earn more wearing the un 's blue helmets abroad than they do without them at home .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch world cup -pipe- 04.07.2010 ' liberated ' veteran arne friedrich is germany 's secret star großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich has been one of the world cup 's best defenders defender arne friedrich was the captain of the worst team in the bundesliga last season .
so why is he suddenly having such a terrific world cup ?
ironically , being out of the spotlight has helped him shine . it may have taken 77 games , but he finally got one .
thirty-one-year-old central defender arne friedrich finally grabbed his first ever goal in german national dress in his side 's surprise 4-0 thrashing of argentina on saturday .
more importantly , though , he anchored a back-four that kept messi , tevez and higuain thoroughly at bay , not allowing the gauchos a single quality look at manuel neuer 's goal .
what 's more , he 's helped germany 's other interior defender , per mertesacker , get through some noticeable wobbles at the start of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : friedrich has picked up the slack for mertesacker " i spoke to him briefly after he came in for criticism , " friedrich said in an interview with the online edition of the german weekly die zeit .
" i told him that i could write a novel about criticism and that i would always be standing beside him on the pitch . "
if anyone had said two weeks ago that friedrich would have been joachim loew 's rock at the back , that person would probably have been put on prescription medications .
as germany headed to south africa , the defender 's place in germany 's starting eleven was anything but sure , and friedrich himself had just been relegated with his former club hertha berlin .
but as friedrich himself has said , not playing for hertha is one key to his renaissance .
bildunterschrift : a dream world cup has followed hertha 's nightmare season the defender , whose manner is usually guarded , has had a lot to say to the german press in the past week .
and the leitmotif has been liberation .
friedrich , the not-so-great " the pressure that i had on me the whole year completely fell away , and i became very relaxed , " friedrich told the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper when asked what it was like coming from relegated hertha to the national team .
after challenging for the bundesliga title in 2008-2009 , hertha plummeted to the bottom of the table early on last season and stayed there .
the inevitable squabbling commenced , and friedrich as captain was able neither to bring the team together nor perform up to speed on the pitch .
friedrich has since transferred to 2008-9 champions wolfsburg .
but the sight of the highly-paid veteran getting nutmegged in front of his own goal became all-too-familiar for hertha devotees .
" i had a very difficult year and played badly in the first half of the season , " friedrich acknowledged in the stadt-anzeiger .
" then i performed better , and we still went down .
as the captain , i was under extreme pressure , and i , too , made mistakes . "
rumors also persist that friedrich was part of a cabal that led to ex-hertha-coach lucien favre getting fired - something friedrich angrily denies .
and that is n't the only bad press that gets friedrich 's gander up .
bildunterschrift : germany 's number 3 was more than a match for stars like tevez although he 's been a fixture in the german national side since 2002 , friedrich has never gotten much love from either fans or the press .
" in 2006 , i also had to take a lot of criticism , " friedrich told die zeit .
" people wrote that i had never been a positive player .
i was never considered a savior , and people said i was just along for the ride … it really ticked me off when people wrote things that were n't true . "
but there was - and is - an element of truth in what was written .
while friedrich is certainly not just along for the ride , he is anything but a natural-born leader .
ahead of the argentina game , while most of the team joked around on the balcony of their hotel in cape town , friedrich was filmed walking alone on the beach staring at the waves .
he himself says he 's not a buddy-buddy sort of player .
" true friendships are very rare in football , " he told die zeit .
that 's about as personal a statement as any journalist is likely to get from the articulate , but wary defender .
and it may explain why , although friedrich is one of only two long-time veterans in the squad , coach joachim loew chose ever-cheerful philipp lahm as his captain and extroverted bastian schweinsteiger as his " on-field leader . "
conversely , friedrich seems to have benefited from being out of the focus - and able to breathe a bit easier .
" unfortunately , i ca n't do anything to change the facts and keep hertha in the first division , " friedrich told die zeit .
" when i joined up again with the national team , it was like a liberation . "
freed from any responsibilities larger than keeping a tight ship at the back , friedrich has turned in five fine performances - more than most defenders in south africa can say .
he 's even finally gotten that elusive first goal for the national team .
and he may even get a first world cup title to cap off his unlikely comeback .

international papers , meanwhile , shower germany with praise for what some describe as the team 's best game yet . newspapers and online news sources in argentina show no mercy on sunday in their assessment of germany 's 4-0 blowout of diego maradona 's star-studded team .
" sweat and tears " is the daily sports paper ole 's online headline .
" this time it was worse than being beaten by -lsb- germany -rsb- four years ago because they scored so early and diego -lsb- maradona -rsb- had no answer , " it adds .
la nacion is no less blunt in its analysis : " germany exposed our weaknesses , left us naked .
argentina had no answers in the face of adversity , with neither carlos tevez nor messi at their best . "
the daily clarin says that argentine star lionel messi was used improperly against the " intelligent rival " germany : " he hung back too much for the ball to reach him .
he had a few bursts which gave hope yet the germans had him in their grip pretty much throughout .
he left the tournament without exploding into life or scoring any goals . "
the response from germany : simply madness !
german newspapers on sunday are shimmering with praise for their team .
" unbelievable , unfathomable , impossible to describe in words , " writes the mass-circulated daily bild zeitung .
" the soccer gods have kissed germany : we beat argentina and are playing the best soccer in the whole world !
thank you our heroes ! "
bildunterschrift : millions of germans celebrated their " heroes " after the blowout victory the daily sueddeutsche zeitung writes : " from little cats into lions , " with the german word for lions , loewen , a play on the name of germany coach , joachim loew .
the paper goes on to say : " first 4-1 against england , now 4-0 against argentina .
german soccer has never experienced such a spectacular week . "
one of the capital 's dailies , the berliner tagesspiegel , writes : " simply madness !
what a team , what a tournament !
the entire world is now celebrating german soccer . "
international praise of germany widespread indeed , the international reception of germany 's victory is one of resounding praise .
the dutch daily de volkskrant runs the headline : " the germans chop up argentina in the frying pan , " adding that " joachim loew 's team was just too strong for the south americans led by diego maradona . " in uruguay , who will face the netherlands in the first semifinal on tuesday , the daily el observador writes " germany struck down argentina , hit them with all the forcefulness that comes with a winning score and laid in the open the misery of diego maradona 's team , all the while showing the world that it 's not a casual candidate for winning the world cup in south africa , but rather a serious favorite . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona 's ' dream has died ' , the guardian wrote spain 's el pais also is full of praise for the young german side . " germany crushes the hopes of maradona .
the loew team gives a recital to an argentian side without a midfielder . "
spain will face germany in the second seminfinal on wednesday . le monde in france wraps up the quarterfinals by pointing out that the much favored south american teams did n't live up to pre-tournament expectations and that the world cup is becoming a largely european affair .
" germany-spain and the netherlands-uruguay are the pairs of semi-finals of the world cup in south africa .
the argentine and brazilian favorites have fallen while ghana has entered legend although beaten by uruguay . " the uk 's the guardian 's assessment focuses on diego maradona , argentina 's dejected coach : " if it had indeed been the will of god that argentina should claim this world cup , then maradona must feel utterly abandoned now .

so why is he suddenly having such a terrific world cup ?
ironically , being out of the spotlight has helped him shine . it may have taken 77 games , but he finally got one .
thirty-one-year-old central defender arne friedrich finally grabbed his first ever goal in german national dress in his side 's surprise 4-0 thrashing of argentina on saturday .
more importantly , though , he anchored a back-four that kept messi , tevez and higuain thoroughly at bay , not allowing the gauchos a single quality look at manuel neuer 's goal .
what 's more , he 's helped germany 's other interior defender , per mertesacker , get through some noticeable wobbles at the start of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : friedrich has picked up the slack for mertesacker " i spoke to him briefly after he came in for criticism , " friedrich said in an interview with the online edition of the german weekly die zeit .
" i told him that i could write a novel about criticism and that i would always be standing beside him on the pitch . "
if anyone had said two weeks ago that friedrich would have been joachim loew 's rock at the back , that person would probably have been put on prescription medications .
as germany headed to south africa , the defender 's place in germany 's starting eleven was anything but sure , and friedrich himself had just been relegated with his former club hertha berlin .
but as friedrich himself has said , not playing for hertha is one key to his renaissance .
bildunterschrift : a dream world cup has followed hertha 's nightmare season the defender , whose manner is usually guarded , has had a lot to say to the german press in the past week .
and the leitmotif has been liberation .
friedrich , the not-so-great " the pressure that i had on me the whole year completely fell away , and i became very relaxed , " friedrich told the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper when asked what it was like coming from relegated hertha to the national team .
after challenging for the bundesliga title in 2008-2009 , hertha plummeted to the bottom of the table early on last season and stayed there .
the inevitable squabbling commenced , and friedrich as captain was able neither to bring the team together nor perform up to speed on the pitch .
friedrich has since transferred to 2008-9 champions wolfsburg .
but the sight of the highly-paid veteran getting nutmegged in front of his own goal became all-too-familiar for hertha devotees .
" i had a very difficult year and played badly in the first half of the season , " friedrich acknowledged in the stadt-anzeiger .
" then i performed better , and we still went down .
as the captain , i was under extreme pressure , and i , too , made mistakes . "
rumors also persist that friedrich was part of a cabal that led to ex-hertha-coach lucien favre getting fired - something friedrich angrily denies .
and that is n't the only bad press that gets friedrich 's gander up .
bildunterschrift : germany 's number 3 was more than a match for stars like tevez although he 's been a fixture in the german national side since 2002 , friedrich has never gotten much love from either fans or the press .
" in 2006 , i also had to take a lot of criticism , " friedrich told die zeit .
" people wrote that i had never been a positive player .
i was never considered a savior , and people said i was just along for the ride … it really ticked me off when people wrote things that were n't true . "
but there was - and is - an element of truth in what was written .
while friedrich is certainly not just along for the ride , he is anything but a natural-born leader .
ahead of the argentina game , while most of the team joked around on the balcony of their hotel in cape town , friedrich was filmed walking alone on the beach staring at the waves .
he himself says he 's not a buddy-buddy sort of player .
" true friendships are very rare in football , " he told die zeit .
that 's about as personal a statement as any journalist is likely to get from the articulate , but wary defender .
and it may explain why , although friedrich is one of only two long-time veterans in the squad , coach joachim loew chose ever-cheerful philipp lahm as his captain and extroverted bastian schweinsteiger as his " on-field leader . "
conversely , friedrich seems to have benefited from being out of the focus - and able to breathe a bit easier .
" unfortunately , i ca n't do anything to change the facts and keep hertha in the first division , " friedrich told die zeit .
" when i joined up again with the national team , it was like a liberation . "
freed from any responsibilities larger than keeping a tight ship at the back , friedrich has turned in five fine performances - more than most defenders in south africa can say .

so why is he suddenly having such a terrific world cup ?
ironically , being out of the spotlight has helped him shine . it may have taken 77 games , but he finally got one .
thirty-one-year-old central defender arne friedrich finally grabbed his first ever goal in german national dress in his side 's surprise 4-0 thrashing of argentina on saturday .
more importantly , though , he anchored a back-four that kept messi , tevez and higuain thoroughly at bay , not allowing the gauchos a single quality look at manuel neuer 's goal .
what 's more , he 's helped germany 's other interior defender , per mertesacker , get through some noticeable wobbles at the start of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : friedrich has picked up the slack for mertesacker " i spoke to him briefly after he came in for criticism , " friedrich said in an interview with the online edition of the german weekly die zeit .
" i told him that i could write a novel about criticism and that i would always be standing beside him on the pitch . "
if anyone had said two weeks ago that friedrich would have been joachim loew 's rock at the back , that person would probably have been put on prescription medications .
as germany headed to south africa , the defender 's place in germany 's starting eleven was anything but sure , and friedrich himself had just been relegated with his former club hertha berlin .
but as friedrich himself has said , not playing for hertha is one key to his renaissance .
bildunterschrift : a dream world cup has followed hertha 's nightmare season the defender , whose manner is usually guarded , has had a lot to say to the german press in the past week .
and the leitmotif has been liberation .
friedrich , the not-so-great " the pressure that i had on me the whole year completely fell away , and i became very relaxed , " friedrich told the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper when asked what it was like coming from relegated hertha to the national team .
after challenging for the bundesliga title in 2008-2009 , hertha plummeted to the bottom of the table early on last season and stayed there .
the inevitable squabbling commenced , and friedrich as captain was able neither to bring the team together nor perform up to speed on the pitch .
friedrich has since transferred to 2008-9 champions wolfsburg .
but the sight of the highly-paid veteran getting nutmegged in front of his own goal became all-too-familiar for hertha devotees .
" i had a very difficult year and played badly in the first half of the season , " friedrich acknowledged in the stadt-anzeiger .
" then i performed better , and we still went down .
as the captain , i was under extreme pressure , and i , too , made mistakes . "
rumors also persist that friedrich was part of a cabal that led to ex-hertha-coach lucien favre getting fired - something friedrich angrily denies .
and that is n't the only bad press that gets friedrich 's gander up .
bildunterschrift : germany 's number 3 was more than a match for stars like tevez although he 's been a fixture in the german national side since 2002 , friedrich has never gotten much love from either fans or the press .
" in 2006 , i also had to take a lot of criticism , " friedrich told die zeit .
" people wrote that i had never been a positive player .
i was never considered a savior , and people said i was just along for the ride … it really ticked me off when people wrote things that were n't true . "
but there was - and is - an element of truth in what was written .
while friedrich is certainly not just along for the ride , he is anything but a natural-born leader .
ahead of the argentina game , while most of the team joked around on the balcony of their hotel in cape town , friedrich was filmed walking alone on the beach staring at the waves .
he himself says he 's not a buddy-buddy sort of player .
" true friendships are very rare in football , " he told die zeit .
that 's about as personal a statement as any journalist is likely to get from the articulate , but wary defender .
and it may explain why , although friedrich is one of only two long-time veterans in the squad , coach joachim loew chose ever-cheerful philipp lahm as his captain and extroverted bastian schweinsteiger as his " on-field leader . "
conversely , friedrich seems to have benefited from being out of the focus - and able to breathe a bit easier .
" unfortunately , i ca n't do anything to change the facts and keep hertha in the first division , " friedrich told die zeit .
" when i joined up again with the national team , it was like a liberation . "
freed from any responsibilities larger than keeping a tight ship at the back , friedrich has turned in five fine performances - more than most defenders in south africa can say .
he 's even finally gotten that elusive first goal for the national team .
and he may even get a first world cup title to cap off his unlikely comeback .

" bavaria became the first german state on sunday to endorse a total smoking ban following a referendum putting an end to smoking in all public buildings .
over three million voters participated in the southern german state 's sixth referendum , with 61 percent voting in favor of the ban , according to the director of state elections .
the citizens ' initiative " for real protection of non-smokers " will impose a total smoking ban on all clubs , bars , restaurants , cafes and beer tents .
the muenchner merkur newspaper on sunday called the vote a " landmark and surprisingly clear " decision .
" few german citizens had trusted the bavarians , often ridiculed as provincial , to show such decisiveness , " the paper said .
emotive issue the referendum was prompted by a heated debate in bavaria , pitting bar owners and restaurant associations against anti-smoking campaigners .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , bavaria 's governing party , had introduced germany 's strongest smoking ban at the beginning of 2008 . but the rules were relaxed a few months later , when the csu formed a state coalition with the free democrats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's premier seehofer gave up smoking at his wife 's request smoking is currently tolerated in small pubs and side-rooms of taverns , as well as in the oktoberfest 's famed beer tents .
the initiative to restore the original ban was backed by the green party and the social democrats .
the new legislation mandates that smoking will be outlawed in all public buildings beginning august 1 .
the rules will also apply to the oktoberfest , but officials have said that the ban will not be enforced there this year .
bavarian premier horst seehofer told daily tabloid bild preceding the referendum that his ruling csu party could live with either possible result of the referendum .
seehofer told the newspaper that he himself had given up social smoking at his wife 's request .

" sweat and tears " is the daily sports paper ole 's online headline .
" this time it was worse than being beaten by -lsb- germany -rsb- four years ago because they scored so early and diego -lsb- maradona -rsb- had no answer , " it adds .
la nacion is no less blunt in its analysis : " germany exposed our weaknesses , left us naked .
argentina had no answers in the face of adversity , with neither carlos tevez nor messi at their best . "
the daily clarin says that argentine star lionel messi was used improperly against the " intelligent rival " germany : " he hung back too much for the ball to reach him .
he had a few bursts which gave hope yet the germans had him in their grip pretty much throughout .
he left the tournament without exploding into life or scoring any goals . "
the response from germany : simply madness !
german newspapers on sunday are shimmering with praise for their team .
" unbelievable , unfathomable , impossible to describe in words , " writes the mass-circulated daily bild zeitung .

following the full-time whistle , germans ran onto the streets in joy and embraced one another after watching their team roll over an underdone argentina .
others formed up motorcades to tour their cities , waving flags from car windows and honking horns .
joachim loew said there was now real belief his young team could go on to win the trophy for the first time in 20 years .
" we really turned in an incredible showing .

and we closed down -lrb- lionel -rrb- messi very well - without resorting to fouls , so that was great , " said loew .
loew 's men tore apart diego maradona 's argentina , with long-serving striker miroslav klose scoring a brace , center-back arne friedrich enjoying a tap-in and 20-year-old thomas mueller heading in his fourth of the tournament .
the only downside of the game for the germans was that mueller picked up a yellow card late in the first half , meaning he will now miss germany 's semifinal clash with spain on wednesday .
loew said the bayern munich man would be sorely missed .
" the fact that we wo n't have mueller in the semifinal is a serious blow as over the past few matches he has shown how dangerous he is , " loew said .

mueller said that merkel had told the team that the game had been wonderful .

merkel called the victory " overwhelming " and " a dream . "
speaking to zdf television from cape town , merkel said that " germany has done something wonderful today , " adding that " it was overwhelming .
this is a dream , just a dream .
this is a young team but the way they played was very good .

" it 's like a knock-out punch from muhammad ali , and i do n't have the strength to do anything .
it was n't the ending we 'd hoped for , but i believe that whoever comes in next will have to continue on the same path because it 's the path the argentines want . "

following the full-time whistle , germans ran onto the streets in joy and embraced one another after watching their team roll over an underdone argentina .
others formed up motorcades to tour their cities , waving flags from car windows and honking horns .
joachim loew said there was now real belief his young team could go on to win the trophy for the first time in 20 years .
" we really turned in an incredible showing .
scoring four goals against argentina you just have to say that that was class .
and we closed down -lrb- lionel -rrb- messi very well - without resorting to fouls , so that was great , " said loew .
loew 's men tore apart diego maradona 's argentina , with long-serving striker miroslav klose scoring a brace , center-back arne friedrich enjoying a tap-in and 20-year-old thomas mueller heading in his fourth of the tournament .
the only downside of the game for the germans was that mueller picked up a yellow card late in the first half , meaning he will now miss germany 's semifinal clash with spain on wednesday .
loew said the bayern munich man would be sorely missed .
" the fact that we wo n't have mueller in the semifinal is a serious blow as over the past few matches he has shown how dangerous he is , " loew said .
" i really do n't see why he got booked .
the ball touches his thigh , then touches his arm from a really short distance . "

we are strong enough to go further .
the team is very young , but what we lack in experience we make up for in audacity and a carefree approach . "
among the 64,000 packed into green point stadium in cape town to cheer on the germans was the country 's leader , chancellor angela merkel , who paid a post-match visit to the players in their dressing room .
mueller said that merkel had told the team that the game had been wonderful .
" she said that she was shivering and shaking with excitement and it was only after the second and third goal that she started to relax and she then turned to south african president jacob zuma , next to whom she was sitting , and said that germany was going to win , " mueller said .

following the full-time whistle , germans ran onto the streets in joy and embraced one another after watching their team roll over an underdone argentina .
others formed up motorcades to tour their cities , waving flags from car windows and honking horns .
joachim loew said there was now real belief his young team could go on to win the trophy for the first time in 20 years .
" we really turned in an incredible showing .
scoring four goals against argentina you just have to say that that was class .
and we closed down -lrb- lionel -rrb- messi very well - without resorting to fouls , so that was great , " said loew .
loew 's men tore apart diego maradona 's argentina , with long-serving striker miroslav klose scoring a brace , center-back arne friedrich enjoying a tap-in and 20-year-old thomas mueller heading in his fourth of the tournament .
the only downside of the game for the germans was that mueller picked up a yellow card late in the first half , meaning he will now miss germany 's semifinal clash with spain on wednesday .
loew said the bayern munich man would be sorely missed .
" the fact that we wo n't have mueller in the semifinal is a serious blow as over the past few matches he has shown how dangerous he is , " loew said .
" i really do n't see why he got booked .
the ball touches his thigh , then touches his arm from a really short distance . "
bildunterschrift : merkel , center-right , said watching the game was ' overwhelming ' spirited performance germany vice captain bastian schweinsteiger , who played an integral role in the quarterfinal win , applauded his teammates for their collective performance .
" we played very well .
i am very proud of the team , " he said .
" the early goal was decisive for us .
we are strong enough to go further .
the team is very young , but what we lack in experience we make up for in audacity and a carefree approach . "
among the 64,000 packed into green point stadium in cape town to cheer on the germans was the country 's leader , chancellor angela merkel , who paid a post-match visit to the players in their dressing room .
mueller said that merkel had told the team that the game had been wonderful .
" she said that she was shivering and shaking with excitement and it was only after the second and third goal that she started to relax and she then turned to south african president jacob zuma , next to whom she was sitting , and said that germany was going to win , " mueller said .
merkel called the victory " overwhelming " and " a dream . "
speaking to zdf television from cape town , merkel said that " germany has done something wonderful today , " adding that " it was overwhelming .
this is a dream , just a dream .
this is a young team but the way they played was very good .
they did n't give argentina much space . "

" i 'm going to be 50 on october 30th , and this is the hardest thing i 've had to go through because i 'm in front of so many good players and good people , " he said at the post-match press conference .
" it 's like a knock-out punch from muhammad ali , and i do n't have the strength to do anything .
it was n't the ending we 'd hoped for , but i believe that whoever comes in next will have to continue on the same path because it 's the path the argentines want . "
meanwhile , the argentine press focused their attention on germany 's " steamroller " performance .
" germany laid bare all the deficiencies of the argentine side which , with neither carlos tevez , messi or -lrb- gonzalo -rrb- higuain at their best , had no answers in the face of adversity , " wrote la nacion daily .
" argentina had a bad time of it and left the world cup stage on the end of a thrashing from a german steamroller , " was the assessment of the infobae news website .
the daily clarin argued that lionel messi had not been used properly and was played too deep .
" he hung back too much for the ball to reach him .
he had a few bursts , which gave hope , yet the germans had him in their grip pretty much throughout .
he left the tournament without exploding into life or scoring any goals , " was the paper 's assessment .

following the full-time whistle , germans ran onto the streets in joy and embraced one another after watching their team roll over an underdone argentina .
others formed up motorcades to tour their cities , waving flags from car windows and honking horns .
joachim loew said there was now real belief his young team could go on to win the trophy for the first time in 20 years .
" we really turned in an incredible showing .
scoring four goals against argentina you just have to say that that was class .
and we closed down -lrb- lionel -rrb- messi very well - without resorting to fouls , so that was great , " said loew .
loew 's men tore apart diego maradona 's argentina , with long-serving striker miroslav klose scoring a brace , center-back arne friedrich enjoying a tap-in and 20-year-old thomas mueller heading in his fourth of the tournament .
the only downside of the game for the germans was that mueller picked up a yellow card late in the first half , meaning he will now miss germany 's semifinal clash with spain on wednesday .
loew said the bayern munich man would be sorely missed .
" the fact that we wo n't have mueller in the semifinal is a serious blow as over the past few matches he has shown how dangerous he is , " loew said .
" i really do n't see why he got booked .
the ball touches his thigh , then touches his arm from a really short distance . "
bildunterschrift : merkel , center-right , said watching the game was ' overwhelming ' spirited performance germany vice captain bastian schweinsteiger , who played an integral role in the quarterfinal win , applauded his teammates for their collective performance .
" we played very well .
i am very proud of the team , " he said .
" the early goal was decisive for us .
we are strong enough to go further .
the team is very young , but what we lack in experience we make up for in audacity and a carefree approach . "
among the 64,000 packed into green point stadium in cape town to cheer on the germans was the country 's leader , chancellor angela merkel , who paid a post-match visit to the players in their dressing room .
mueller said that merkel had told the team that the game had been wonderful .
" she said that she was shivering and shaking with excitement and it was only after the second and third goal that she started to relax and she then turned to south african president jacob zuma , next to whom she was sitting , and said that germany was going to win , " mueller said .
merkel called the victory " overwhelming " and " a dream . "
speaking to zdf television from cape town , merkel said that " germany has done something wonderful today , " adding that " it was overwhelming .
this is a dream , just a dream .
this is a young team but the way they played was very good .
they did n't give argentina much space . "
end of maradona experiment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speculation is now rife that maradona will step down from his post much speculation in argentina will now focus on the post-world cup future of diego maradona , who hinted strongly after the loss to germany that he would now quit as head coach .
" i 'm going to be 50 on october 30th , and this is the hardest thing i 've had to go through because i 'm in front of so many good players and good people , " he said at the post-match press conference .
" it 's like a knock-out punch from muhammad ali , and i do n't have the strength to do anything .
it was n't the ending we 'd hoped for , but i believe that whoever comes in next will have to continue on the same path because it 's the path the argentines want . "
meanwhile , the argentine press focused their attention on germany 's " steamroller " performance .
" germany laid bare all the deficiencies of the argentine side which , with neither carlos tevez , messi or -lrb- gonzalo -rrb- higuain at their best , had no answers in the face of adversity , " wrote la nacion daily .
" argentina had a bad time of it and left the world cup stage on the end of a thrashing from a german steamroller , " was the assessment of the infobae news website .
the daily clarin argued that lionel messi had not been used properly and was played too deep .
" he hung back too much for the ball to reach him .
he had a few bursts , which gave hope , yet the germans had him in their grip pretty much throughout .
he left the tournament without exploding into life or scoring any goals , " was the paper 's assessment .

so why is he suddenly having such a terrific world cup ?
ironically , being out of the spotlight has helped him shine . it may have taken 77 games , but he finally got one .
thirty-one-year-old central defender arne friedrich finally grabbed his first ever goal in german national dress in his side 's surprise 4-0 thrashing of argentina on saturday .
more importantly , though , he anchored a back-four that kept messi , tevez and higuain thoroughly at bay , not allowing the gauchos a single quality look at manuel neuer 's goal .
what 's more , he 's helped germany 's other interior defender , per mertesacker , get through some noticeable wobbles at the start of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : friedrich has picked up the slack for mertesacker " i spoke to him briefly after he came in for criticism , " friedrich said in an interview with the online edition of the german weekly die zeit .
" i told him that i could write a novel about criticism and that i would always be standing beside him on the pitch . "
if anyone had said two weeks ago that friedrich would have been joachim loew 's rock at the back , that person would probably have been put on prescription medications .
as germany headed to south africa , the defender 's place in germany 's starting eleven was anything but sure , and friedrich himself had just been relegated with his former club hertha berlin .
but as friedrich himself has said , not playing for hertha is one key to his renaissance .
bildunterschrift : a dream world cup has followed hertha 's nightmare season the defender , whose manner is usually guarded , has had a lot to say to the german press in the past week .
and the leitmotif has been liberation .
friedrich , the not-so-great " the pressure that i had on me the whole year completely fell away , and i became very relaxed , " friedrich told the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper when asked what it was like coming from relegated hertha to the national team .
after challenging for the bundesliga title in 2008-2009 , hertha plummeted to the bottom of the table early on last season and stayed there .
the inevitable squabbling commenced , and friedrich as captain was able neither to bring the team together nor perform up to speed on the pitch .
friedrich has since transferred to 2008-9 champions wolfsburg .
but the sight of the highly-paid veteran getting nutmegged in front of his own goal became all-too-familiar for hertha devotees .
" i had a very difficult year and played badly in the first half of the season , " friedrich acknowledged in the stadt-anzeiger .
" then i performed better , and we still went down .
as the captain , i was under extreme pressure , and i , too , made mistakes . "
rumors also persist that friedrich was part of a cabal that led to ex-hertha-coach lucien favre getting fired - something friedrich angrily denies .
and that is n't the only bad press that gets friedrich 's gander up .
bildunterschrift : germany 's number 3 was more than a match for stars like tevez although he 's been a fixture in the german national side since 2002 , friedrich has never gotten much love from either fans or the press .
" in 2006 , i also had to take a lot of criticism , " friedrich told die zeit .
" people wrote that i had never been a positive player .
i was never considered a savior , and people said i was just along for the ride … it really ticked me off when people wrote things that were n't true . "
but there was - and is - an element of truth in what was written .
while friedrich is certainly not just along for the ride , he is anything but a natural-born leader .
ahead of the argentina game , while most of the team joked around on the balcony of their hotel in cape town , friedrich was filmed walking alone on the beach staring at the waves .
he himself says he 's not a buddy-buddy sort of player .
" true friendships are very rare in football , " he told die zeit .
that 's about as personal a statement as any journalist is likely to get from the articulate , but wary defender .
and it may explain why , although friedrich is one of only two long-time veterans in the squad , coach joachim loew chose ever-cheerful philipp lahm as his captain and extroverted bastian schweinsteiger as his " on-field leader . "
conversely , friedrich seems to have benefited from being out of the focus - and able to breathe a bit easier .
" unfortunately , i ca n't do anything to change the facts and keep hertha in the first division , " friedrich told die zeit .
" when i joined up again with the national team , it was like a liberation . "
freed from any responsibilities larger than keeping a tight ship at the back , friedrich has turned in five fine performances - more than most defenders in south africa can say .
he 's even finally gotten that elusive first goal for the national team .
and he may even get a first world cup title to cap off his unlikely comeback .

after challenging for the bundesliga title in 2008-2009 , hertha plummeted to the bottom of the table early on last season and stayed there .
the inevitable squabbling commenced , and friedrich as captain was able neither to bring the team together nor perform up to speed on the pitch .
friedrich has since transferred to 2008-9 champions wolfsburg .
but the sight of the highly-paid veteran getting nutmegged in front of his own goal became all-too-familiar for hertha devotees .
" i had a very difficult year and played badly in the first half of the season , " friedrich acknowledged in the stadt-anzeiger .
" then i performed better , and we still went down .
as the captain , i was under extreme pressure , and i , too , made mistakes . "
rumors also persist that friedrich was part of a cabal that led to ex-hertha-coach lucien favre getting fired - something friedrich angrily denies .
and that is n't the only bad press that gets friedrich 's gander up .
bildunterschrift : germany 's number 3 was more than a match for stars like tevez although he 's been a fixture in the german national side since 2002 , friedrich has never gotten much love from either fans or the press .
" in 2006 , i also had to take a lot of criticism , " friedrich told die zeit .
" people wrote that i had never been a positive player .
i was never considered a savior , and people said i was just along for the ride … it really ticked me off when people wrote things that were n't true . "
but there was - and is - an element of truth in what was written .
while friedrich is certainly not just along for the ride , he is anything but a natural-born leader .
ahead of the argentina game , while most of the team joked around on the balcony of their hotel in cape town , friedrich was filmed walking alone on the beach staring at the waves .
he himself says he 's not a buddy-buddy sort of player .
" true friendships are very rare in football , " he told die zeit .
that 's about as personal a statement as any journalist is likely to get from the articulate , but wary defender .
and it may explain why , although friedrich is one of only two long-time veterans in the squad , coach joachim loew chose ever-cheerful philipp lahm as his captain and extroverted bastian schweinsteiger as his " on-field leader . "
conversely , friedrich seems to have benefited from being out of the focus - and able to breathe a bit easier .
" unfortunately , i ca n't do anything to change the facts and keep hertha in the first division , " friedrich told die zeit .
" when i joined up again with the national team , it was like a liberation . "
freed from any responsibilities larger than keeping a tight ship at the back , friedrich has turned in five fine performances - more than most defenders in south africa can say .
he 's even finally gotten that elusive first goal for the national team .
and he may even get a first world cup title to cap off his unlikely comeback .

so why is he suddenly having such a terrific world cup ?
ironically , being out of the spotlight has helped him shine . it may have taken 77 games , but he finally got one .
thirty-one-year-old central defender arne friedrich finally grabbed his first ever goal in german national dress in his side 's surprise 4-0 thrashing of argentina on saturday .
more importantly , though , he anchored a back-four that kept messi , tevez and higuain thoroughly at bay , not allowing the gauchos a single quality look at manuel neuer 's goal .
what 's more , he 's helped germany 's other interior defender , per mertesacker , get through some noticeable wobbles at the start of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : friedrich has picked up the slack for mertesacker " i spoke to him briefly after he came in for criticism , " friedrich said in an interview with the online edition of the german weekly die zeit .
" i told him that i could write a novel about criticism and that i would always be standing beside him on the pitch . "
if anyone had said two weeks ago that friedrich would have been joachim loew 's rock at the back , that person would probably have been put on prescription medications .
as germany headed to south africa , the defender 's place in germany 's starting eleven was anything but sure , and friedrich himself had just been relegated with his former club hertha berlin .
but as friedrich himself has said , not playing for hertha is one key to his renaissance .

so why is he suddenly having such a terrific world cup ?
ironically , being out of the spotlight has helped him shine . it may have taken 77 games , but he finally got one .
thirty-one-year-old central defender arne friedrich finally grabbed his first ever goal in german national dress in his side 's surprise 4-0 thrashing of argentina on saturday .
more importantly , though , he anchored a back-four that kept messi , tevez and higuain thoroughly at bay , not allowing the gauchos a single quality look at manuel neuer 's goal .
what 's more , he 's helped germany 's other interior defender , per mertesacker , get through some noticeable wobbles at the start of the tournament .
bildunterschrift : friedrich has picked up the slack for mertesacker " i spoke to him briefly after he came in for criticism , " friedrich said in an interview with the online edition of the german weekly die zeit .
" i told him that i could write a novel about criticism and that i would always be standing beside him on the pitch . "
if anyone had said two weeks ago that friedrich would have been joachim loew 's rock at the back , that person would probably have been put on prescription medications .
as germany headed to south africa , the defender 's place in germany 's starting eleven was anything but sure , and friedrich himself had just been relegated with his former club hertha berlin .
but as friedrich himself has said , not playing for hertha is one key to his renaissance .
bildunterschrift : a dream world cup has followed hertha 's nightmare season the defender , whose manner is usually guarded , has had a lot to say to the german press in the past week .
and the leitmotif has been liberation .
friedrich , the not-so-great " the pressure that i had on me the whole year completely fell away , and i became very relaxed , " friedrich told the koelner stadt-anzeiger newspaper when asked what it was like coming from relegated hertha to the national team .
after challenging for the bundesliga title in 2008-2009 , hertha plummeted to the bottom of the table early on last season and stayed there .
the inevitable squabbling commenced , and friedrich as captain was able neither to bring the team together nor perform up to speed on the pitch .
friedrich has since transferred to 2008-9 champions wolfsburg .
but the sight of the highly-paid veteran getting nutmegged in front of his own goal became all-too-familiar for hertha devotees .
" i had a very difficult year and played badly in the first half of the season , " friedrich acknowledged in the stadt-anzeiger .
" then i performed better , and we still went down .
as the captain , i was under extreme pressure , and i , too , made mistakes . "
rumors also persist that friedrich was part of a cabal that led to ex-hertha-coach lucien favre getting fired - something friedrich angrily denies .
and that is n't the only bad press that gets friedrich 's gander up .
bildunterschrift : germany 's number 3 was more than a match for stars like tevez although he 's been a fixture in the german national side since 2002 , friedrich has never gotten much love from either fans or the press .
" in 2006 , i also had to take a lot of criticism , " friedrich told die zeit .
" people wrote that i had never been a positive player .
i was never considered a savior , and people said i was just along for the ride … it really ticked me off when people wrote things that were n't true . "
but there was - and is - an element of truth in what was written .
while friedrich is certainly not just along for the ride , he is anything but a natural-born leader .
ahead of the argentina game , while most of the team joked around on the balcony of their hotel in cape town , friedrich was filmed walking alone on the beach staring at the waves .
he himself says he 's not a buddy-buddy sort of player .
" true friendships are very rare in football , " he told die zeit .
that 's about as personal a statement as any journalist is likely to get from the articulate , but wary defender .
and it may explain why , although friedrich is one of only two long-time veterans in the squad , coach joachim loew chose ever-cheerful philipp lahm as his captain and extroverted bastian schweinsteiger as his " on-field leader . "
conversely , friedrich seems to have benefited from being out of the focus - and able to breathe a bit easier .
" unfortunately , i ca n't do anything to change the facts and keep hertha in the first division , " friedrich told die zeit .
" when i joined up again with the national team , it was like a liberation . "
freed from any responsibilities larger than keeping a tight ship at the back , friedrich has turned in five fine performances - more than most defenders in south africa can say .
he 's even finally gotten that elusive first goal for the national team .
and he may even get a first world cup title to cap off his unlikely comeback .
