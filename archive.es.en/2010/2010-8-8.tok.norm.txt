critics of the government say the country may be stable but has moved far away from being a real democracy . rwandans went to the ballot box on monday to vote for a new president , although no one was biting their nails over the outcome - the country 's sitting president , paul kagame , was expected to win with some 90 percent of the vote .
critics say despite its democratic appearance , the election represents just another seven-year extension of kagame 's iron-fisted rule during which rwanda 's economy has flourished , but any political opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed , turning the east african nation into what amounts to a one-party state .
" after the genocide there was the appearance to a certain extent of a liberal system , but for many years one can clearly see that it 's a de facto one-party state , " denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" there are a few political parties allowed , but those represented in parliament ca n't be considered a real opposition , " he said .
monday 's vote is the second presidential election since the country was rocked with genocidal violence in 1994 that killed some 800,000 .
while the country has not seen a repeat of that horror , this election run-up has been marked by a spate of arrests , mysterious killings and restrictions on the free-speech rights of critical opposition figures that could well affect the nation 's long-term stability , and reopen the wounds left over from the genocide .
growth and stability kagame 's supporters , including many in the west , can point to a string of accomplishments during his 16 years at the top - 10 as president - beginning in those dark days in 1994 , when he helped end the wave of killing that had wracked the country .
after the genocide , the country was in ruins , today rwanda is the safest , cleanest country in africa , with no slums and almost no begging or street crime .
its economy is expected to grow 6 percent this year and tax revenues to increase by 12 percent .
kagame has positioned himself as a foe of corruption which has attracted donors and private investors , including big names like starbucks and the gulf investment firm dubai world .
berlin-based corruption watchdog transparency international ranks rwanda as the least corrupt country in east africa .
the world bank puts the country among the top five most attractive african nations to do business .
kagame 's popularity with foreign donors has meant the country 's food stocks are swelling , the chinese have built a basic road network and south korea is laying a fiber-optic system across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government often touts its successful efforts to improve the status of rwandan women his ruling rwandan patriotic front party has overseen a trebling of household incomes and today citizens have access to universal health insurance and the country 's parliament has a higher percentage of female members than anywhere else in the world - 56 percent .
" i will continue to work as hard as i can till the day we can speak of a rwanda that has achieved the kind of prosperity that leaves no one behind and everyone proud of who they are , " kagame wrote in a letter to supporters posted on his website friday .
the other side of the coin but there is a dark side to kagame 's rule , critics say , charging that all the stability has came at a high price - human rights .
over the last few months , a string of attacks on rwandans with whom the president has fallen out has raised eyebrows and suspicions .
opposition politicians and independent journalists have been harassed , arrested , or worse .
police have arrested two aspiring presidential candidates and opposition supporters have been detained for holding an illegal rally .
victoire ingabire , a hutu politician who had hoped to stand against kagame , must face charges of " denying the genocide " while in exile .
general faustin kayumba nyamwasa , a critic kagame , fled his homeland in february and was shot in the stomach in june in south africa .
the deputy editor of a critical newspaper was recently shot and killed outside his home in the capital kigali .
andre kagwa rwisereka , the deputy leader of the opposition democratic green party of rwanda , was found nearly decapitated in the south of the country .
" we have stability here and you can see economic improvement .
but we do n't think it 's sustainable , because we say stability and democracy must go hand and hand , " frank habineza , president of rwanda 's green party , told deutsche welle by telephone from kigali .
he said he himself was threatened by unnamed men in february who he suspects of being government security operatives .
" we know kagame 's party is going to win this election , because the president is very prepared and he has no competition at all , " he added .
" this election is an election where there is no opposition . "
kagame won a 2003 presidential election with 95 percent of the vote .
this time around , he faces three opponents who backed him seven years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kagame has been a darling of the west , which has overlooked much criticism western support despite the recent events , all of which the government denies having any role in , rwanda still enjoys a good deal of enthusiastic western support since the country is seen as something of a model for the continent .
kagame 's list of advisors includes tony blair , bill clinton , high-profile us evangelist rick warren and the ceos of google and starbucks .
it also helps that kagame , 52 , is an elegant , charismatic figure , who speaks well and knows how to court international players .
over the past few weeks , kagame has responded to allegations about democratic deficits by saying democracy in rwanda takes time to establish , stability is the priority , especially given the convulsion of 1994 .
" your model of democracy , why should it be suitable for me , " he told britain 's guardian newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagame has used his role in ending the 1994 genocide to his advantage foreign governments and advisors have been mostly quiet about the rights situation , despite the fact that rwanda is ranked 183 out of 195 countries for freedom of the press .
according to analyst tull , that is partly due to the fact that kagame , the rebel army leader who stopped the genocide , has successfully played on western guilt about its non-intervention during the killing .
" the government is saying , we have other goals , like stability and development , and we wo n't be told by others how to lead our country , especially by an international community which did n't intervene to stop the genocide , " he said .
" that is the message and it 's getting across fairly well because we have n't seen that much criticism from outside . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 08.08.2010 a free-thinking belarusian university can only operate outside of belarus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photography project at the university - uncensored president alexander lukashenko of belarus shut down the european humanities university in 2004 - he felt it was too independent .
but the university reopened in lithuania and is now a magnet for students from belarus . " the ehu is a university in exile , " maxim , a student proudly told a group of high school graduates from belarus during a tour of the european humanities university -lrb- ehu -rrb- facilities on open house day .
the ehu is located in a building on the outskirts of the lithuanian capital , vilnius , where it moved by invitation of the lithuanian government after being forcibly and abruptly closed down by the belarusian authorities in minsk six years ago .
the european commission , several eu nations and the united states also provide support to the exile university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular : the comedy club at the ehu maxim told the visiting students how important extra-curricular activities were at his university .
it has its own newspaper , several sports clubs and a team of election observers scheduled to travel to bosnia-herzegovina for this year 's parliamentary polls - the students organize everything themselves .
" any questions ? "
" please ask questions - that 's important ! "
maxim told the tour group . but in general , he knows from experience that belarus high school graduates are not used to asking questions yet , at least not questions that might not be officially desirable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art students at a lecture vilnius is just a two-hour train ride from minsk , the capital of belarus , the two countries share a border , but they are nevertheless worlds apart .
lithuania joined the european union in 2004 , while neighboring belarus has been ruled by its authoritarian president , alexander lukashenko , for the past 16 years .
two belarusian professors founded the european humanities university in minsk in 1992 , shortly after the collapse of the soviet union .
" we wanted to end decades of separation from the rest of europe , and finally establish studies free of ideology , " said anatoli mikhailov , the university 's principal .

but the university reopened in lithuania and is now a magnet for students from belarus . " the ehu is a university in exile , " maxim , a student proudly told a group of high school graduates from belarus during a tour of the european humanities university -lrb- ehu -rrb- facilities on open house day .
the ehu is located in a building on the outskirts of the lithuanian capital , vilnius , where it moved by invitation of the lithuanian government after being forcibly and abruptly closed down by the belarusian authorities in minsk six years ago .
the european commission , several eu nations and the united states also provide support to the exile university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular : the comedy club at the ehu maxim told the visiting students how important extra-curricular activities were at his university .
it has its own newspaper , several sports clubs and a team of election observers scheduled to travel to bosnia-herzegovina for this year 's parliamentary polls - the students organize everything themselves .
" any questions ? "
" please ask questions - that 's important ! "
maxim told the tour group . but in general , he knows from experience that belarus high school graduates are not used to asking questions yet , at least not questions that might not be officially desirable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art students at a lecture vilnius is just a two-hour train ride from minsk , the capital of belarus , the two countries share a border , but they are nevertheless worlds apart .
lithuania joined the european union in 2004 , while neighboring belarus has been ruled by its authoritarian president , alexander lukashenko , for the past 16 years .
two belarusian professors founded the european humanities university in minsk in 1992 , shortly after the collapse of the soviet union .
" we wanted to end decades of separation from the rest of europe , and finally establish studies free of ideology , " said anatoli mikhailov , the university 's principal .
the newly founded university quickly formed international ties ; within belarus , it soon became known for its disputatious students .

critics of the government say the country may be stable but has moved far away from being a real democracy . rwandans went to the ballot box on monday to vote for a new president , although no one was biting their nails over the outcome - the country 's sitting president , paul kagame , was expected to win with some 90 percent of the vote .
critics say despite its democratic appearance , the election represents just another seven-year extension of kagame 's iron-fisted rule during which rwanda 's economy has flourished , but any political opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed , turning the east african nation into what amounts to a one-party state .
" after the genocide there was the appearance to a certain extent of a liberal system , but for many years one can clearly see that it 's a de facto one-party state , " denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" there are a few political parties allowed , but those represented in parliament ca n't be considered a real opposition , " he said .
monday 's vote is the second presidential election since the country was rocked with genocidal violence in 1994 that killed some 800,000 .
while the country has not seen a repeat of that horror , this election run-up has been marked by a spate of arrests , mysterious killings and restrictions on the free-speech rights of critical opposition figures that could well affect the nation 's long-term stability , and reopen the wounds left over from the genocide .
growth and stability kagame 's supporters , including many in the west , can point to a string of accomplishments during his 16 years at the top - 10 as president - beginning in those dark days in 1994 , when he helped end the wave of killing that had wracked the country .
after the genocide , the country was in ruins , today rwanda is the safest , cleanest country in africa , with no slums and almost no begging or street crime .
its economy is expected to grow 6 percent this year and tax revenues to increase by 12 percent .
kagame has positioned himself as a foe of corruption which has attracted donors and private investors , including big names like starbucks and the gulf investment firm dubai world .
berlin-based corruption watchdog transparency international ranks rwanda as the least corrupt country in east africa .
the world bank puts the country among the top five most attractive african nations to do business .
kagame 's popularity with foreign donors has meant the country 's food stocks are swelling , the chinese have built a basic road network and south korea is laying a fiber-optic system across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government often touts its successful efforts to improve the status of rwandan women his ruling rwandan patriotic front party has overseen a trebling of household incomes and today citizens have access to universal health insurance and the country 's parliament has a higher percentage of female members than anywhere else in the world - 56 percent .
" i will continue to work as hard as i can till the day we can speak of a rwanda that has achieved the kind of prosperity that leaves no one behind and everyone proud of who they are , " kagame wrote in a letter to supporters posted on his website friday .
the other side of the coin but there is a dark side to kagame 's rule , critics say , charging that all the stability has came at a high price - human rights .
over the last few months , a string of attacks on rwandans with whom the president has fallen out has raised eyebrows and suspicions .
opposition politicians and independent journalists have been harassed , arrested , or worse .
police have arrested two aspiring presidential candidates and opposition supporters have been detained for holding an illegal rally .
victoire ingabire , a hutu politician who had hoped to stand against kagame , must face charges of " denying the genocide " while in exile .
general faustin kayumba nyamwasa , a critic kagame , fled his homeland in february and was shot in the stomach in june in south africa .
the deputy editor of a critical newspaper was recently shot and killed outside his home in the capital kigali .
andre kagwa rwisereka , the deputy leader of the opposition democratic green party of rwanda , was found nearly decapitated in the south of the country .
" we have stability here and you can see economic improvement .
but we do n't think it 's sustainable , because we say stability and democracy must go hand and hand , " frank habineza , president of rwanda 's green party , told deutsche welle by telephone from kigali .
he said he himself was threatened by unnamed men in february who he suspects of being government security operatives .
" we know kagame 's party is going to win this election , because the president is very prepared and he has no competition at all , " he added .
" this election is an election where there is no opposition . "
kagame won a 2003 presidential election with 95 percent of the vote .
this time around , he faces three opponents who backed him seven years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kagame has been a darling of the west , which has overlooked much criticism western support despite the recent events , all of which the government denies having any role in , rwanda still enjoys a good deal of enthusiastic western support since the country is seen as something of a model for the continent .
kagame 's list of advisors includes tony blair , bill clinton , high-profile us evangelist rick warren and the ceos of google and starbucks .
it also helps that kagame , 52 , is an elegant , charismatic figure , who speaks well and knows how to court international players .
over the past few weeks , kagame has responded to allegations about democratic deficits by saying democracy in rwanda takes time to establish , stability is the priority , especially given the convulsion of 1994 .
" your model of democracy , why should it be suitable for me , " he told britain 's guardian newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagame has used his role in ending the 1994 genocide to his advantage foreign governments and advisors have been mostly quiet about the rights situation , despite the fact that rwanda is ranked 183 out of 195 countries for freedom of the press .
according to analyst tull , that is partly due to the fact that kagame , the rebel army leader who stopped the genocide , has successfully played on western guilt about its non-intervention during the killing .
" the government is saying , we have other goals , like stability and development , and we wo n't be told by others how to lead our country , especially by an international community which did n't intervene to stop the genocide , " he said .
" that is the message and it 's getting across fairly well because we have n't seen that much criticism from outside . "

critics of the government say the country may be stable but has moved far away from being a real democracy . rwandans went to the ballot box on monday to vote for a new president , although no one was biting their nails over the outcome - the country 's sitting president , paul kagame , was expected to win with some 90 percent of the vote .
critics say despite its democratic appearance , the election represents just another seven-year extension of kagame 's iron-fisted rule during which rwanda 's economy has flourished , but any political opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed , turning the east african nation into what amounts to a one-party state .
" after the genocide there was the appearance to a certain extent of a liberal system , but for many years one can clearly see that it 's a de facto one-party state , " denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" there are a few political parties allowed , but those represented in parliament ca n't be considered a real opposition , " he said .
monday 's vote is the second presidential election since the country was rocked with genocidal violence in 1994 that killed some 800,000 .
while the country has not seen a repeat of that horror , this election run-up has been marked by a spate of arrests , mysterious killings and restrictions on the free-speech rights of critical opposition figures that could well affect the nation 's long-term stability , and reopen the wounds left over from the genocide .
growth and stability kagame 's supporters , including many in the west , can point to a string of accomplishments during his 16 years at the top - 10 as president - beginning in those dark days in 1994 , when he helped end the wave of killing that had wracked the country .
after the genocide , the country was in ruins , today rwanda is the safest , cleanest country in africa , with no slums and almost no begging or street crime .
its economy is expected to grow 6 percent this year and tax revenues to increase by 12 percent .
kagame has positioned himself as a foe of corruption which has attracted donors and private investors , including big names like starbucks and the gulf investment firm dubai world .
berlin-based corruption watchdog transparency international ranks rwanda as the least corrupt country in east africa .
the world bank puts the country among the top five most attractive african nations to do business .
kagame 's popularity with foreign donors has meant the country 's food stocks are swelling , the chinese have built a basic road network and south korea is laying a fiber-optic system across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government often touts its successful efforts to improve the status of rwandan women his ruling rwandan patriotic front party has overseen a trebling of household incomes and today citizens have access to universal health insurance and the country 's parliament has a higher percentage of female members than anywhere else in the world - 56 percent .
" i will continue to work as hard as i can till the day we can speak of a rwanda that has achieved the kind of prosperity that leaves no one behind and everyone proud of who they are , " kagame wrote in a letter to supporters posted on his website friday .
the other side of the coin but there is a dark side to kagame 's rule , critics say , charging that all the stability has came at a high price - human rights .
over the last few months , a string of attacks on rwandans with whom the president has fallen out has raised eyebrows and suspicions .
opposition politicians and independent journalists have been harassed , arrested , or worse .
police have arrested two aspiring presidential candidates and opposition supporters have been detained for holding an illegal rally .
victoire ingabire , a hutu politician who had hoped to stand against kagame , must face charges of " denying the genocide " while in exile .
general faustin kayumba nyamwasa , a critic kagame , fled his homeland in february and was shot in the stomach in june in south africa .
the deputy editor of a critical newspaper was recently shot and killed outside his home in the capital kigali .
andre kagwa rwisereka , the deputy leader of the opposition democratic green party of rwanda , was found nearly decapitated in the south of the country .
" we have stability here and you can see economic improvement .
but we do n't think it 's sustainable , because we say stability and democracy must go hand and hand , " frank habineza , president of rwanda 's green party , told deutsche welle by telephone from kigali .
he said he himself was threatened by unnamed men in february who he suspects of being government security operatives .
" we know kagame 's party is going to win this election , because the president is very prepared and he has no competition at all , " he added .
" this election is an election where there is no opposition . "
kagame won a 2003 presidential election with 95 percent of the vote .
this time around , he faces three opponents who backed him seven years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kagame has been a darling of the west , which has overlooked much criticism western support despite the recent events , all of which the government denies having any role in , rwanda still enjoys a good deal of enthusiastic western support since the country is seen as something of a model for the continent .
kagame 's list of advisors includes tony blair , bill clinton , high-profile us evangelist rick warren and the ceos of google and starbucks .
it also helps that kagame , 52 , is an elegant , charismatic figure , who speaks well and knows how to court international players .
over the past few weeks , kagame has responded to allegations about democratic deficits by saying democracy in rwanda takes time to establish , stability is the priority , especially given the convulsion of 1994 .
" your model of democracy , why should it be suitable for me , " he told britain 's guardian newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagame has used his role in ending the 1994 genocide to his advantage foreign governments and advisors have been mostly quiet about the rights situation , despite the fact that rwanda is ranked 183 out of 195 countries for freedom of the press .
according to analyst tull , that is partly due to the fact that kagame , the rebel army leader who stopped the genocide , has successfully played on western guilt about its non-intervention during the killing .
" the government is saying , we have other goals , like stability and development , and we wo n't be told by others how to lead our country , especially by an international community which did n't intervene to stop the genocide , " he said .
" that is the message and it 's getting across fairly well because we have n't seen that much criticism from outside . "

loverboys , now also a phenomenon in germany , are pimps who snare victims as lovers before forcing them into prostitution . pimps who coax teenage girls into relationships and then force them into prostitution have become so common that dutch police gave the pimps a name - " loverboys . " an estimated 5,000 young women in the country are believed to be victims of the tactic .
a group called stop loverboys now , founded in 2008 , has helped more than a hundred girls . earlier this year , the organization opened an office in germany where it is currently supporting four girls who fell prey to loverboys as well as several parents whose daughters were victims . appear genuine at first for girls like merel van groningen , back in the netherlands , these abusive relationships appeared to be genuine at first .
merel was 15 years old - and vulnerable - when she met mike , a man 10 years older than her . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls start out believing they have found romance " he was my first boyfriend , so i had nothing to compare him with .
he made me feel good about myself , " merel told deutsche welle . " my father had found a new girlfriend back then and my mother also had started a new family and i did n't feel welcome by either of them .
but i felt at home when i was with mike .
he did everything for me .
he said he would take care of me . " merel ignored appeals from her mother , who told her that mike was not good for her . but before long , her new partner was asking her to sleep with other men for money .
indeed , mike was also prepared to go to extraordinary lengths to make her comply . threatened and starved he threatened merel with a gun and deprived her of food until , feeling increasingly dependent upon him , she finally accepted prostitution as a way of life without ever earning a cent . methods adopted by loverboys are varied , according to anita de witt , head of stop loverboys now . some tell the girl that sleeping with a stranger just a one-time thing to help pay a debt - otherwise their sweetheart will end up in jail .
others acquire naked footage of them on camera so that they can blackmail the girls , saying they will post the material on the internet if they do n't sleep with other men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims are threatened with exposure on the internet , or violence regardless of the approach , one thing is common - the young women fall deeply in love and are made to believe the loverboy is all they have in the world . the press office of the amsterdam police said it could not provide official numbers of victims or perpetrators , something that de witt said was understandable . " there are a lot of girls who are afraid , " she said .
" they 're afraid something will happen to the parents or their brother or their sister and that 's why they do n't want to talk . " a peculiar kind of loyalty journalist maria genova , who published a book about loverboys this year , has found that , despite everything , most victims remain loyal to their loverboys . " there is support but a lot of these women do n't want to be helped because they do n't believe they are victims .
it 's so strange , " she said . " they really try to protect the loverboy , " she added .
" a lot of times after they get help they are still so in love with them that they go back to him . " genova added that , in her opinion , the jail sentences given to such men are usually rather light - between two and three years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merel stood in a shop window as her price was negotiated merel ended up working as a prostitute for her loverboy for two months and said she would never forget the first time she stood in front of men negotiating her price . " you 're behind a window in your underwear .
you feel very small because you 're in your underwear and everyone 's looking at you , " she said .
" then you 're only worth 20 euros for the man you thought loved you . " helped to escape eventually a nearby shop owner realized merel was underage and helped her escape .
she returned home and never saw mike again but wrote a book , " misled , " which was published four years ago . although the experience of recording her memories may have proved cathartic , the mental scars still remain for merel .
mike was never brought to justice and she harbors fears that her past could catch up with her . " if someone comes to my place to fix something i make sure that i 'm close enough to the door so that i can run away any moment , " she said . " if i 'm talking about it like for an interview i always look around to ensure no one knows me .

critics of the government say the country may be stable but has moved far away from being a real democracy . rwandans went to the ballot box on monday to vote for a new president , although no one was biting their nails over the outcome - the country 's sitting president , paul kagame , was expected to win with some 90 percent of the vote .
critics say despite its democratic appearance , the election represents just another seven-year extension of kagame 's iron-fisted rule during which rwanda 's economy has flourished , but any political opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed , turning the east african nation into what amounts to a one-party state .
" after the genocide there was the appearance to a certain extent of a liberal system , but for many years one can clearly see that it 's a de facto one-party state , " denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" there are a few political parties allowed , but those represented in parliament ca n't be considered a real opposition , " he said .
monday 's vote is the second presidential election since the country was rocked with genocidal violence in 1994 that killed some 800,000 .
while the country has not seen a repeat of that horror , this election run-up has been marked by a spate of arrests , mysterious killings and restrictions on the free-speech rights of critical opposition figures that could well affect the nation 's long-term stability , and reopen the wounds left over from the genocide .
growth and stability kagame 's supporters , including many in the west , can point to a string of accomplishments during his 16 years at the top - 10 as president - beginning in those dark days in 1994 , when he helped end the wave of killing that had wracked the country .
after the genocide , the country was in ruins , today rwanda is the safest , cleanest country in africa , with no slums and almost no begging or street crime .
its economy is expected to grow 6 percent this year and tax revenues to increase by 12 percent .
kagame has positioned himself as a foe of corruption which has attracted donors and private investors , including big names like starbucks and the gulf investment firm dubai world .
berlin-based corruption watchdog transparency international ranks rwanda as the least corrupt country in east africa .
the world bank puts the country among the top five most attractive african nations to do business .
kagame 's popularity with foreign donors has meant the country 's food stocks are swelling , the chinese have built a basic road network and south korea is laying a fiber-optic system across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government often touts its successful efforts to improve the status of rwandan women his ruling rwandan patriotic front party has overseen a trebling of household incomes and today citizens have access to universal health insurance and the country 's parliament has a higher percentage of female members than anywhere else in the world - 56 percent .
" i will continue to work as hard as i can till the day we can speak of a rwanda that has achieved the kind of prosperity that leaves no one behind and everyone proud of who they are , " kagame wrote in a letter to supporters posted on his website friday .
the other side of the coin but there is a dark side to kagame 's rule , critics say , charging that all the stability has came at a high price - human rights .
over the last few months , a string of attacks on rwandans with whom the president has fallen out has raised eyebrows and suspicions .
opposition politicians and independent journalists have been harassed , arrested , or worse .
police have arrested two aspiring presidential candidates and opposition supporters have been detained for holding an illegal rally .

the scanners have raised fears about risks to health and personal privacy . the controversial full body scanner will become a feature of life for passengers passing through german airport security within weeks as hamburg 's airport will begin using the devices next month .
early tests of the apparatus will begin in hamburg at the beginning of september , interior minister thomas de maiziere said .
the hi-tech security measure has proved controversial in some eu countries , with critics saying the scanners are too invasive .
de maiziere told the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that he was satisfied that the technology did not pose a risk to health , or privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere said that privacy and health fears had been addressed " there is no real picture of the body , " said de maiziere , adding that individuals and suspicious objects would be represented in " a schematic representation of the body , like stick men . " the scanners use waves to scan the body for explosives or weapons .
suspicious objects are marked on the monitor with a red spot .
" experts have carefully measured and ascertained that the radiation the body scanner uses poses no health hazard , " said de maiziere .
the use of the scanners , even as a test , is likely to generate lively debate within germany .
privacy concerns civil liberties groups protest that the scanners amount to an invasion of privacy , while privacy campaigners say that the technology violates european law by producing sexually explicit images .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data that could show body contours is supposed to be deleted the united states called on members of the european union to introduce scanners after a nigerian passenger tried to blow up a plane bound for chicago on christmas day last year with explosives hidden in his underwear .
us security authorities had demanded that original pictures taken by the machine - which display the contours of the body - be saved for possible later use .
however , the german interior ministry has insisted that all images be deleted after passengers pass through the airport .
extension of the technology to all german airports is not expected to take place until the middle of 2011 .
full-body scanners are already used in some eu countries , such as britain and the netherlands .
eu member states including spain and germany voiced concerns about an eu-wide introduction of the technology at a meeting of eu interior ministers earlier this year . author : richard connor -lrb- dpa / afp / dpa -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 08.08.2010 a free-thinking belarusian university can only operate outside of belarus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a photography project at the university - uncensored president alexander lukashenko of belarus shut down the european humanities university in 2004 - he felt it was too independent .
but the university reopened in lithuania and is now a magnet for students from belarus . " the ehu is a university in exile , " maxim , a student proudly told a group of high school graduates from belarus during a tour of the european humanities university -lrb- ehu -rrb- facilities on open house day .
the ehu is located in a building on the outskirts of the lithuanian capital , vilnius , where it moved by invitation of the lithuanian government after being forcibly and abruptly closed down by the belarusian authorities in minsk six years ago .
the european commission , several eu nations and the united states also provide support to the exile university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular : the comedy club at the ehu maxim told the visiting students how important extra-curricular activities were at his university .
it has its own newspaper , several sports clubs and a team of election observers scheduled to travel to bosnia-herzegovina for this year 's parliamentary polls - the students organize everything themselves .
" any questions ? "
" please ask questions - that 's important ! "
maxim told the tour group . but in general , he knows from experience that belarus high school graduates are not used to asking questions yet , at least not questions that might not be officially desirable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art students at a lecture vilnius is just a two-hour train ride from minsk , the capital of belarus , the two countries share a border , but they are nevertheless worlds apart .
lithuania joined the european union in 2004 , while neighboring belarus has been ruled by its authoritarian president , alexander lukashenko , for the past 16 years .
two belarusian professors founded the european humanities university in minsk in 1992 , shortly after the collapse of the soviet union .
" we wanted to end decades of separation from the rest of europe , and finally establish studies free of ideology , " said anatoli mikhailov , the university 's principal .
the newly founded university quickly formed international ties ; within belarus , it soon became known for its disputatious students .
too independent protests following alexander lukashenko 's first re-election in 2001 showed that almost the entire ehu 's student body opposed the president . the university came under increasing pressure and in 2004 the country 's education ministry withdrew the ehu 's teaching permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhailov : we wanted a university free of ideology formal reasons were cited , but mikhailov said the move was clearly political .
" lukashenko always personally appointed the state universities ' heads , " he said .
" everything was under state control - except for us .
we were like an island . "
the authorities , mikhailov said , must have regarded the university as a threat to all of the country 's students . lithuanian asylum formally , ehu is a lithuanian university , but 97 percent of its roughly 2,000 students come from belarus .
they commute back and forth or get a degree via correspondence courses .
tatsiana chulitskaya , who teaches politics at the ehu , said some students chose the university for pragmatic reasons , since it is the only belarusian university to offer a european degree .
she said the b.a. was not recognized in belarus , but it allowed students to continue their studies in europe and in the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open house at the ehu katerina , 20 , studies art at the ehu .
she was not very interested in politics , and was shocked that the professors routinely encouraged the students to ask questions .
" that was something we were not used to , " she said . but now , she added , she was learning how to gather information and to form her own opinion based on that information .
that created a certain distance from her friends in belarus , she said .
" they do n't see any alternatives , they 've all got the same black-and-white point of view , and they are content as long as there 's no war , " she said next , katerina wants to get a master 's degree , either at the ehu or another european university .
in the long run she does want to return to belarus - taking with her a newly acquired ability to challenge and question the status quo .

" the ehu is a university in exile , " maxim , a student proudly told a group of high school graduates from belarus during a tour of the european humanities university -lrb- ehu -rrb- facilities on open house day .
the ehu is located in a building on the outskirts of the lithuanian capital , vilnius , where it moved by invitation of the lithuanian government after being forcibly and abruptly closed down by the belarusian authorities in minsk six years ago .
the european commission , several eu nations and the united states also provide support to the exile university .

" we wanted to end decades of separation from the rest of europe , and finally establish studies free of ideology , " said anatoli mikhailov , the university 's principal .
the newly founded university quickly formed international ties ; within belarus , it soon became known for its disputatious students .
too independent protests following alexander lukashenko 's first re-election in 2001 showed that almost the entire ehu 's student body opposed the president . the university came under increasing pressure and in 2004 the country 's education ministry withdrew the ehu 's teaching permit .

that created a certain distance from her friends in belarus , she said .
" they do n't see any alternatives , they 've all got the same black-and-white point of view , and they are content as long as there 's no war , " she said next , katerina wants to get a master 's degree , either at the ehu or another european university .

but the university reopened in lithuania and is now a magnet for students from belarus . " the ehu is a university in exile , " maxim , a student proudly told a group of high school graduates from belarus during a tour of the european humanities university -lrb- ehu -rrb- facilities on open house day .
the ehu is located in a building on the outskirts of the lithuanian capital , vilnius , where it moved by invitation of the lithuanian government after being forcibly and abruptly closed down by the belarusian authorities in minsk six years ago .
the european commission , several eu nations and the united states also provide support to the exile university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular : the comedy club at the ehu maxim told the visiting students how important extra-curricular activities were at his university .
it has its own newspaper , several sports clubs and a team of election observers scheduled to travel to bosnia-herzegovina for this year 's parliamentary polls - the students organize everything themselves .
" any questions ? "
" please ask questions - that 's important ! "
maxim told the tour group . but in general , he knows from experience that belarus high school graduates are not used to asking questions yet , at least not questions that might not be officially desirable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art students at a lecture vilnius is just a two-hour train ride from minsk , the capital of belarus , the two countries share a border , but they are nevertheless worlds apart .
lithuania joined the european union in 2004 , while neighboring belarus has been ruled by its authoritarian president , alexander lukashenko , for the past 16 years .
two belarusian professors founded the european humanities university in minsk in 1992 , shortly after the collapse of the soviet union .
" we wanted to end decades of separation from the rest of europe , and finally establish studies free of ideology , " said anatoli mikhailov , the university 's principal .
the newly founded university quickly formed international ties ; within belarus , it soon became known for its disputatious students .
too independent protests following alexander lukashenko 's first re-election in 2001 showed that almost the entire ehu 's student body opposed the president . the university came under increasing pressure and in 2004 the country 's education ministry withdrew the ehu 's teaching permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhailov : we wanted a university free of ideology formal reasons were cited , but mikhailov said the move was clearly political .
" lukashenko always personally appointed the state universities ' heads , " he said .
" everything was under state control - except for us .
we were like an island . "
the authorities , mikhailov said , must have regarded the university as a threat to all of the country 's students . lithuanian asylum formally , ehu is a lithuanian university , but 97 percent of its roughly 2,000 students come from belarus .
they commute back and forth or get a degree via correspondence courses .
tatsiana chulitskaya , who teaches politics at the ehu , said some students chose the university for pragmatic reasons , since it is the only belarusian university to offer a european degree .
she said the b.a. was not recognized in belarus , but it allowed students to continue their studies in europe and in the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open house at the ehu katerina , 20 , studies art at the ehu .
she was not very interested in politics , and was shocked that the professors routinely encouraged the students to ask questions .
" that was something we were not used to , " she said . but now , she added , she was learning how to gather information and to form her own opinion based on that information .
that created a certain distance from her friends in belarus , she said .
" they do n't see any alternatives , they 've all got the same black-and-white point of view , and they are content as long as there 's no war , " she said next , katerina wants to get a master 's degree , either at the ehu or another european university .
in the long run she does want to return to belarus - taking with her a newly acquired ability to challenge and question the status quo .

critics of the government say the country may be stable but has moved far away from being a real democracy . rwandans went to the ballot box on monday to vote for a new president , although no one was biting their nails over the outcome - the country 's sitting president , paul kagame , was expected to win with some 90 percent of the vote .
critics say despite its democratic appearance , the election represents just another seven-year extension of kagame 's iron-fisted rule during which rwanda 's economy has flourished , but any political opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed , turning the east african nation into what amounts to a one-party state .
" after the genocide there was the appearance to a certain extent of a liberal system , but for many years one can clearly see that it 's a de facto one-party state , " denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" there are a few political parties allowed , but those represented in parliament ca n't be considered a real opposition , " he said .
monday 's vote is the second presidential election since the country was rocked with genocidal violence in 1994 that killed some 800,000 .
while the country has not seen a repeat of that horror , this election run-up has been marked by a spate of arrests , mysterious killings and restrictions on the free-speech rights of critical opposition figures that could well affect the nation 's long-term stability , and reopen the wounds left over from the genocide .
growth and stability kagame 's supporters , including many in the west , can point to a string of accomplishments during his 16 years at the top - 10 as president - beginning in those dark days in 1994 , when he helped end the wave of killing that had wracked the country .
after the genocide , the country was in ruins , today rwanda is the safest , cleanest country in africa , with no slums and almost no begging or street crime .
its economy is expected to grow 6 percent this year and tax revenues to increase by 12 percent .
kagame has positioned himself as a foe of corruption which has attracted donors and private investors , including big names like starbucks and the gulf investment firm dubai world .
berlin-based corruption watchdog transparency international ranks rwanda as the least corrupt country in east africa .
the world bank puts the country among the top five most attractive african nations to do business .
kagame 's popularity with foreign donors has meant the country 's food stocks are swelling , the chinese have built a basic road network and south korea is laying a fiber-optic system across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government often touts its successful efforts to improve the status of rwandan women his ruling rwandan patriotic front party has overseen a trebling of household incomes and today citizens have access to universal health insurance and the country 's parliament has a higher percentage of female members than anywhere else in the world - 56 percent .
" i will continue to work as hard as i can till the day we can speak of a rwanda that has achieved the kind of prosperity that leaves no one behind and everyone proud of who they are , " kagame wrote in a letter to supporters posted on his website friday .
the other side of the coin but there is a dark side to kagame 's rule , critics say , charging that all the stability has came at a high price - human rights .
over the last few months , a string of attacks on rwandans with whom the president has fallen out has raised eyebrows and suspicions .
opposition politicians and independent journalists have been harassed , arrested , or worse .
police have arrested two aspiring presidential candidates and opposition supporters have been detained for holding an illegal rally .

he said he himself was threatened by unnamed men in february who he suspects of being government security operatives .
" we know kagame 's party is going to win this election , because the president is very prepared and he has no competition at all , " he added .
" this election is an election where there is no opposition . "

this time around , he faces three opponents who backed him seven years ago .

critics of the government say the country may be stable but has moved far away from being a real democracy . rwandans went to the ballot box on monday to vote for a new president , although no one was biting their nails over the outcome - the country 's sitting president , paul kagame , was expected to win with some 90 percent of the vote .
critics say despite its democratic appearance , the election represents just another seven-year extension of kagame 's iron-fisted rule during which rwanda 's economy has flourished , but any political opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed , turning the east african nation into what amounts to a one-party state .
" after the genocide there was the appearance to a certain extent of a liberal system , but for many years one can clearly see that it 's a de facto one-party state , " denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" there are a few political parties allowed , but those represented in parliament ca n't be considered a real opposition , " he said .
monday 's vote is the second presidential election since the country was rocked with genocidal violence in 1994 that killed some 800,000 .
while the country has not seen a repeat of that horror , this election run-up has been marked by a spate of arrests , mysterious killings and restrictions on the free-speech rights of critical opposition figures that could well affect the nation 's long-term stability , and reopen the wounds left over from the genocide .
growth and stability kagame 's supporters , including many in the west , can point to a string of accomplishments during his 16 years at the top - 10 as president - beginning in those dark days in 1994 , when he helped end the wave of killing that had wracked the country .
after the genocide , the country was in ruins , today rwanda is the safest , cleanest country in africa , with no slums and almost no begging or street crime .
its economy is expected to grow 6 percent this year and tax revenues to increase by 12 percent .
kagame has positioned himself as a foe of corruption which has attracted donors and private investors , including big names like starbucks and the gulf investment firm dubai world .
berlin-based corruption watchdog transparency international ranks rwanda as the least corrupt country in east africa .
the world bank puts the country among the top five most attractive african nations to do business .
kagame 's popularity with foreign donors has meant the country 's food stocks are swelling , the chinese have built a basic road network and south korea is laying a fiber-optic system across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government often touts its successful efforts to improve the status of rwandan women his ruling rwandan patriotic front party has overseen a trebling of household incomes and today citizens have access to universal health insurance and the country 's parliament has a higher percentage of female members than anywhere else in the world - 56 percent .
" i will continue to work as hard as i can till the day we can speak of a rwanda that has achieved the kind of prosperity that leaves no one behind and everyone proud of who they are , " kagame wrote in a letter to supporters posted on his website friday .
the other side of the coin but there is a dark side to kagame 's rule , critics say , charging that all the stability has came at a high price - human rights .
over the last few months , a string of attacks on rwandans with whom the president has fallen out has raised eyebrows and suspicions .
opposition politicians and independent journalists have been harassed , arrested , or worse .

critics of the government say the country may be stable but has moved far away from being a real democracy . rwandans went to the ballot box on monday to vote for a new president , although no one was biting their nails over the outcome - the country 's sitting president , paul kagame , was expected to win with some 90 percent of the vote .
critics say despite its democratic appearance , the election represents just another seven-year extension of kagame 's iron-fisted rule during which rwanda 's economy has flourished , but any political opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed , turning the east african nation into what amounts to a one-party state .
" after the genocide there was the appearance to a certain extent of a liberal system , but for many years one can clearly see that it 's a de facto one-party state , " denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" there are a few political parties allowed , but those represented in parliament ca n't be considered a real opposition , " he said .
monday 's vote is the second presidential election since the country was rocked with genocidal violence in 1994 that killed some 800,000 .
while the country has not seen a repeat of that horror , this election run-up has been marked by a spate of arrests , mysterious killings and restrictions on the free-speech rights of critical opposition figures that could well affect the nation 's long-term stability , and reopen the wounds left over from the genocide .
growth and stability kagame 's supporters , including many in the west , can point to a string of accomplishments during his 16 years at the top - 10 as president - beginning in those dark days in 1994 , when he helped end the wave of killing that had wracked the country .
after the genocide , the country was in ruins , today rwanda is the safest , cleanest country in africa , with no slums and almost no begging or street crime .
its economy is expected to grow 6 percent this year and tax revenues to increase by 12 percent .
kagame has positioned himself as a foe of corruption which has attracted donors and private investors , including big names like starbucks and the gulf investment firm dubai world .
berlin-based corruption watchdog transparency international ranks rwanda as the least corrupt country in east africa .
the world bank puts the country among the top five most attractive african nations to do business .
kagame 's popularity with foreign donors has meant the country 's food stocks are swelling , the chinese have built a basic road network and south korea is laying a fiber-optic system across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government often touts its successful efforts to improve the status of rwandan women his ruling rwandan patriotic front party has overseen a trebling of household incomes and today citizens have access to universal health insurance and the country 's parliament has a higher percentage of female members than anywhere else in the world - 56 percent .
" i will continue to work as hard as i can till the day we can speak of a rwanda that has achieved the kind of prosperity that leaves no one behind and everyone proud of who they are , " kagame wrote in a letter to supporters posted on his website friday .
the other side of the coin but there is a dark side to kagame 's rule , critics say , charging that all the stability has came at a high price - human rights .
over the last few months , a string of attacks on rwandans with whom the president has fallen out has raised eyebrows and suspicions .
opposition politicians and independent journalists have been harassed , arrested , or worse .

he said he himself was threatened by unnamed men in february who he suspects of being government security operatives .
" we know kagame 's party is going to win this election , because the president is very prepared and he has no competition at all , " he added .

according to analyst tull , that is partly due to the fact that kagame , the rebel army leader who stopped the genocide , has successfully played on western guilt about its non-intervention during the killing .
" the government is saying , we have other goals , like stability and development , and we wo n't be told by others how to lead our country , especially by an international community which did n't intervene to stop the genocide , " he said .
" that is the message and it 's getting across fairly well because we have n't seen that much criticism from outside . "

the scanners have raised fears about risks to health and personal privacy . the controversial full body scanner will become a feature of life for passengers passing through german airport security within weeks as hamburg 's airport will begin using the devices next month .
early tests of the apparatus will begin in hamburg at the beginning of september , interior minister thomas de maiziere said .
the hi-tech security measure has proved controversial in some eu countries , with critics saying the scanners are too invasive .
de maiziere told the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that he was satisfied that the technology did not pose a risk to health , or privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere said that privacy and health fears had been addressed " there is no real picture of the body , " said de maiziere , adding that individuals and suspicious objects would be represented in " a schematic representation of the body , like stick men . " the scanners use waves to scan the body for explosives or weapons .
suspicious objects are marked on the monitor with a red spot .
" experts have carefully measured and ascertained that the radiation the body scanner uses poses no health hazard , " said de maiziere .
the use of the scanners , even as a test , is likely to generate lively debate within germany .
privacy concerns civil liberties groups protest that the scanners amount to an invasion of privacy , while privacy campaigners say that the technology violates european law by producing sexually explicit images .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data that could show body contours is supposed to be deleted the united states called on members of the european union to introduce scanners after a nigerian passenger tried to blow up a plane bound for chicago on christmas day last year with explosives hidden in his underwear .
us security authorities had demanded that original pictures taken by the machine - which display the contours of the body - be saved for possible later use .
however , the german interior ministry has insisted that all images be deleted after passengers pass through the airport .
extension of the technology to all german airports is not expected to take place until the middle of 2011 .
full-body scanners are already used in some eu countries , such as britain and the netherlands .
eu member states including spain and germany voiced concerns about an eu-wide introduction of the technology at a meeting of eu interior ministers earlier this year . author : richard connor -lrb- dpa / afp / dpa -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the university reopened in lithuania and is now a magnet for students from belarus . " the ehu is a university in exile , " maxim , a student proudly told a group of high school graduates from belarus during a tour of the european humanities university -lrb- ehu -rrb- facilities on open house day .
the ehu is located in a building on the outskirts of the lithuanian capital , vilnius , where it moved by invitation of the lithuanian government after being forcibly and abruptly closed down by the belarusian authorities in minsk six years ago .
the european commission , several eu nations and the united states also provide support to the exile university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular : the comedy club at the ehu maxim told the visiting students how important extra-curricular activities were at his university .
it has its own newspaper , several sports clubs and a team of election observers scheduled to travel to bosnia-herzegovina for this year 's parliamentary polls - the students organize everything themselves .
" any questions ? "
" please ask questions - that 's important ! "
maxim told the tour group . but in general , he knows from experience that belarus high school graduates are not used to asking questions yet , at least not questions that might not be officially desirable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art students at a lecture vilnius is just a two-hour train ride from minsk , the capital of belarus , the two countries share a border , but they are nevertheless worlds apart .
lithuania joined the european union in 2004 , while neighboring belarus has been ruled by its authoritarian president , alexander lukashenko , for the past 16 years .
two belarusian professors founded the european humanities university in minsk in 1992 , shortly after the collapse of the soviet union .
" we wanted to end decades of separation from the rest of europe , and finally establish studies free of ideology , " said anatoli mikhailov , the university 's principal .
the newly founded university quickly formed international ties ; within belarus , it soon became known for its disputatious students .
too independent protests following alexander lukashenko 's first re-election in 2001 showed that almost the entire ehu 's student body opposed the president . the university came under increasing pressure and in 2004 the country 's education ministry withdrew the ehu 's teaching permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhailov : we wanted a university free of ideology formal reasons were cited , but mikhailov said the move was clearly political .
" lukashenko always personally appointed the state universities ' heads , " he said .
" everything was under state control - except for us .
we were like an island . "
the authorities , mikhailov said , must have regarded the university as a threat to all of the country 's students . lithuanian asylum formally , ehu is a lithuanian university , but 97 percent of its roughly 2,000 students come from belarus .
they commute back and forth or get a degree via correspondence courses .
tatsiana chulitskaya , who teaches politics at the ehu , said some students chose the university for pragmatic reasons , since it is the only belarusian university to offer a european degree .
she said the b.a. was not recognized in belarus , but it allowed students to continue their studies in europe and in the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open house at the ehu katerina , 20 , studies art at the ehu .
she was not very interested in politics , and was shocked that the professors routinely encouraged the students to ask questions .
" that was something we were not used to , " she said . but now , she added , she was learning how to gather information and to form her own opinion based on that information .
that created a certain distance from her friends in belarus , she said .
" they do n't see any alternatives , they 've all got the same black-and-white point of view , and they are content as long as there 's no war , " she said next , katerina wants to get a master 's degree , either at the ehu or another european university .
in the long run she does want to return to belarus - taking with her a newly acquired ability to challenge and question the status quo .

the scanners have raised fears about risks to health and personal privacy . the controversial full body scanner will become a feature of life for passengers passing through german airport security within weeks as hamburg 's airport will begin using the devices next month .
early tests of the apparatus will begin in hamburg at the beginning of september , interior minister thomas de maiziere said .

suspicious objects are marked on the monitor with a red spot .
" experts have carefully measured and ascertained that the radiation the body scanner uses poses no health hazard , " said de maiziere .

however , the german interior ministry has insisted that all images be deleted after passengers pass through the airport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.08.2010 in rwanda , stability trumps democracy as nation goes to polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kagame is expected to be reelected with an overwhelming majority rwandans voted monday in presidential elections , but the outcome is already all but certain .
critics of the government say the country may be stable but has moved far away from being a real democracy . rwandans went to the ballot box on monday to vote for a new president , although no one was biting their nails over the outcome - the country 's sitting president , paul kagame , was expected to win with some 90 percent of the vote .
critics say despite its democratic appearance , the election represents just another seven-year extension of kagame 's iron-fisted rule during which rwanda 's economy has flourished , but any political opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed , turning the east african nation into what amounts to a one-party state .
" after the genocide there was the appearance to a certain extent of a liberal system , but for many years one can clearly see that it 's a de facto one-party state , " denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" there are a few political parties allowed , but those represented in parliament ca n't be considered a real opposition , " he said .
monday 's vote is the second presidential election since the country was rocked with genocidal violence in 1994 that killed some 800,000 .
while the country has not seen a repeat of that horror , this election run-up has been marked by a spate of arrests , mysterious killings and restrictions on the free-speech rights of critical opposition figures that could well affect the nation 's long-term stability , and reopen the wounds left over from the genocide .
growth and stability kagame 's supporters , including many in the west , can point to a string of accomplishments during his 16 years at the top - 10 as president - beginning in those dark days in 1994 , when he helped end the wave of killing that had wracked the country .
after the genocide , the country was in ruins , today rwanda is the safest , cleanest country in africa , with no slums and almost no begging or street crime .
its economy is expected to grow 6 percent this year and tax revenues to increase by 12 percent .
kagame has positioned himself as a foe of corruption which has attracted donors and private investors , including big names like starbucks and the gulf investment firm dubai world .
berlin-based corruption watchdog transparency international ranks rwanda as the least corrupt country in east africa .
the world bank puts the country among the top five most attractive african nations to do business .
kagame 's popularity with foreign donors has meant the country 's food stocks are swelling , the chinese have built a basic road network and south korea is laying a fiber-optic system across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government often touts its successful efforts to improve the status of rwandan women his ruling rwandan patriotic front party has overseen a trebling of household incomes and today citizens have access to universal health insurance and the country 's parliament has a higher percentage of female members than anywhere else in the world - 56 percent .
" i will continue to work as hard as i can till the day we can speak of a rwanda that has achieved the kind of prosperity that leaves no one behind and everyone proud of who they are , " kagame wrote in a letter to supporters posted on his website friday .
the other side of the coin but there is a dark side to kagame 's rule , critics say , charging that all the stability has came at a high price - human rights .
over the last few months , a string of attacks on rwandans with whom the president has fallen out has raised eyebrows and suspicions .
opposition politicians and independent journalists have been harassed , arrested , or worse .
police have arrested two aspiring presidential candidates and opposition supporters have been detained for holding an illegal rally .
victoire ingabire , a hutu politician who had hoped to stand against kagame , must face charges of " denying the genocide " while in exile .
general faustin kayumba nyamwasa , a critic kagame , fled his homeland in february and was shot in the stomach in june in south africa .
the deputy editor of a critical newspaper was recently shot and killed outside his home in the capital kigali .
andre kagwa rwisereka , the deputy leader of the opposition democratic green party of rwanda , was found nearly decapitated in the south of the country .
" we have stability here and you can see economic improvement .
but we do n't think it 's sustainable , because we say stability and democracy must go hand and hand , " frank habineza , president of rwanda 's green party , told deutsche welle by telephone from kigali .
he said he himself was threatened by unnamed men in february who he suspects of being government security operatives .
" we know kagame 's party is going to win this election , because the president is very prepared and he has no competition at all , " he added .
" this election is an election where there is no opposition . "
kagame won a 2003 presidential election with 95 percent of the vote .
this time around , he faces three opponents who backed him seven years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kagame has been a darling of the west , which has overlooked much criticism western support despite the recent events , all of which the government denies having any role in , rwanda still enjoys a good deal of enthusiastic western support since the country is seen as something of a model for the continent .
kagame 's list of advisors includes tony blair , bill clinton , high-profile us evangelist rick warren and the ceos of google and starbucks .
it also helps that kagame , 52 , is an elegant , charismatic figure , who speaks well and knows how to court international players .
over the past few weeks , kagame has responded to allegations about democratic deficits by saying democracy in rwanda takes time to establish , stability is the priority , especially given the convulsion of 1994 .
" your model of democracy , why should it be suitable for me , " he told britain 's guardian newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagame has used his role in ending the 1994 genocide to his advantage foreign governments and advisors have been mostly quiet about the rights situation , despite the fact that rwanda is ranked 183 out of 195 countries for freedom of the press .
according to analyst tull , that is partly due to the fact that kagame , the rebel army leader who stopped the genocide , has successfully played on western guilt about its non-intervention during the killing .
" the government is saying , we have other goals , like stability and development , and we wo n't be told by others how to lead our country , especially by an international community which did n't intervene to stop the genocide , " he said .
" that is the message and it 's getting across fairly well because we have n't seen that much criticism from outside . "

the scanners have raised fears about risks to health and personal privacy . the controversial full body scanner will become a feature of life for passengers passing through german airport security within weeks as hamburg 's airport will begin using the devices next month .
early tests of the apparatus will begin in hamburg at the beginning of september , interior minister thomas de maiziere said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere said that privacy and health fears had been addressed " there is no real picture of the body , " said de maiziere , adding that individuals and suspicious objects would be represented in " a schematic representation of the body , like stick men . " the scanners use waves to scan the body for explosives or weapons .
suspicious objects are marked on the monitor with a red spot .
" experts have carefully measured and ascertained that the radiation the body scanner uses poses no health hazard , " said de maiziere .
the use of the scanners , even as a test , is likely to generate lively debate within germany .

but the university reopened in lithuania and is now a magnet for students from belarus . " the ehu is a university in exile , " maxim , a student proudly told a group of high school graduates from belarus during a tour of the european humanities university -lrb- ehu -rrb- facilities on open house day .
the ehu is located in a building on the outskirts of the lithuanian capital , vilnius , where it moved by invitation of the lithuanian government after being forcibly and abruptly closed down by the belarusian authorities in minsk six years ago .
the european commission , several eu nations and the united states also provide support to the exile university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular : the comedy club at the ehu maxim told the visiting students how important extra-curricular activities were at his university .
it has its own newspaper , several sports clubs and a team of election observers scheduled to travel to bosnia-herzegovina for this year 's parliamentary polls - the students organize everything themselves .
" any questions ? "
" please ask questions - that 's important ! "
maxim told the tour group . but in general , he knows from experience that belarus high school graduates are not used to asking questions yet , at least not questions that might not be officially desirable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art students at a lecture vilnius is just a two-hour train ride from minsk , the capital of belarus , the two countries share a border , but they are nevertheless worlds apart .
lithuania joined the european union in 2004 , while neighboring belarus has been ruled by its authoritarian president , alexander lukashenko , for the past 16 years .
two belarusian professors founded the european humanities university in minsk in 1992 , shortly after the collapse of the soviet union .
" we wanted to end decades of separation from the rest of europe , and finally establish studies free of ideology , " said anatoli mikhailov , the university 's principal .
the newly founded university quickly formed international ties ; within belarus , it soon became known for its disputatious students .
too independent protests following alexander lukashenko 's first re-election in 2001 showed that almost the entire ehu 's student body opposed the president . the university came under increasing pressure and in 2004 the country 's education ministry withdrew the ehu 's teaching permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhailov : we wanted a university free of ideology formal reasons were cited , but mikhailov said the move was clearly political .
" lukashenko always personally appointed the state universities ' heads , " he said .
" everything was under state control - except for us .
we were like an island . "
the authorities , mikhailov said , must have regarded the university as a threat to all of the country 's students . lithuanian asylum formally , ehu is a lithuanian university , but 97 percent of its roughly 2,000 students come from belarus .
they commute back and forth or get a degree via correspondence courses .
tatsiana chulitskaya , who teaches politics at the ehu , said some students chose the university for pragmatic reasons , since it is the only belarusian university to offer a european degree .
she said the b.a. was not recognized in belarus , but it allowed students to continue their studies in europe and in the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open house at the ehu katerina , 20 , studies art at the ehu .
she was not very interested in politics , and was shocked that the professors routinely encouraged the students to ask questions .
" that was something we were not used to , " she said . but now , she added , she was learning how to gather information and to form her own opinion based on that information .
that created a certain distance from her friends in belarus , she said .
" they do n't see any alternatives , they 've all got the same black-and-white point of view , and they are content as long as there 's no war , " she said next , katerina wants to get a master 's degree , either at the ehu or another european university .
in the long run she does want to return to belarus - taking with her a newly acquired ability to challenge and question the status quo .

critics of the government say the country may be stable but has moved far away from being a real democracy . rwandans went to the ballot box on monday to vote for a new president , although no one was biting their nails over the outcome - the country 's sitting president , paul kagame , was expected to win with some 90 percent of the vote .
critics say despite its democratic appearance , the election represents just another seven-year extension of kagame 's iron-fisted rule during which rwanda 's economy has flourished , but any political opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed , turning the east african nation into what amounts to a one-party state .
" after the genocide there was the appearance to a certain extent of a liberal system , but for many years one can clearly see that it 's a de facto one-party state , " denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" there are a few political parties allowed , but those represented in parliament ca n't be considered a real opposition , " he said .
monday 's vote is the second presidential election since the country was rocked with genocidal violence in 1994 that killed some 800,000 .
while the country has not seen a repeat of that horror , this election run-up has been marked by a spate of arrests , mysterious killings and restrictions on the free-speech rights of critical opposition figures that could well affect the nation 's long-term stability , and reopen the wounds left over from the genocide .
growth and stability kagame 's supporters , including many in the west , can point to a string of accomplishments during his 16 years at the top - 10 as president - beginning in those dark days in 1994 , when he helped end the wave of killing that had wracked the country .
after the genocide , the country was in ruins , today rwanda is the safest , cleanest country in africa , with no slums and almost no begging or street crime .
its economy is expected to grow 6 percent this year and tax revenues to increase by 12 percent .
kagame has positioned himself as a foe of corruption which has attracted donors and private investors , including big names like starbucks and the gulf investment firm dubai world .
berlin-based corruption watchdog transparency international ranks rwanda as the least corrupt country in east africa .
the world bank puts the country among the top five most attractive african nations to do business .
kagame 's popularity with foreign donors has meant the country 's food stocks are swelling , the chinese have built a basic road network and south korea is laying a fiber-optic system across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government often touts its successful efforts to improve the status of rwandan women his ruling rwandan patriotic front party has overseen a trebling of household incomes and today citizens have access to universal health insurance and the country 's parliament has a higher percentage of female members than anywhere else in the world - 56 percent .
" i will continue to work as hard as i can till the day we can speak of a rwanda that has achieved the kind of prosperity that leaves no one behind and everyone proud of who they are , " kagame wrote in a letter to supporters posted on his website friday .
the other side of the coin but there is a dark side to kagame 's rule , critics say , charging that all the stability has came at a high price - human rights .
over the last few months , a string of attacks on rwandans with whom the president has fallen out has raised eyebrows and suspicions .
opposition politicians and independent journalists have been harassed , arrested , or worse .
police have arrested two aspiring presidential candidates and opposition supporters have been detained for holding an illegal rally .

" we have stability here and you can see economic improvement .
but we do n't think it 's sustainable , because we say stability and democracy must go hand and hand , " frank habineza , president of rwanda 's green party , told deutsche welle by telephone from kigali .
he said he himself was threatened by unnamed men in february who he suspects of being government security operatives .
" we know kagame 's party is going to win this election , because the president is very prepared and he has no competition at all , " he added .
" this election is an election where there is no opposition . "

it also helps that kagame , 52 , is an elegant , charismatic figure , who speaks well and knows how to court international players .
over the past few weeks , kagame has responded to allegations about democratic deficits by saying democracy in rwanda takes time to establish , stability is the priority , especially given the convulsion of 1994 .
" your model of democracy , why should it be suitable for me , " he told britain 's guardian newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagame has used his role in ending the 1994 genocide to his advantage foreign governments and advisors have been mostly quiet about the rights situation , despite the fact that rwanda is ranked 183 out of 195 countries for freedom of the press .
according to analyst tull , that is partly due to the fact that kagame , the rebel army leader who stopped the genocide , has successfully played on western guilt about its non-intervention during the killing .
" the government is saying , we have other goals , like stability and development , and we wo n't be told by others how to lead our country , especially by an international community which did n't intervene to stop the genocide , " he said .
" that is the message and it 's getting across fairly well because we have n't seen that much criticism from outside . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 08.08.2010 hamburg airport to test controversial body scanners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scanners will show a representation of the body within weeks , german air passengers in hamburg will pass through full-body scanners before catching their flights .
the scanners have raised fears about risks to health and personal privacy . the controversial full body scanner will become a feature of life for passengers passing through german airport security within weeks as hamburg 's airport will begin using the devices next month .
early tests of the apparatus will begin in hamburg at the beginning of september , interior minister thomas de maiziere said .
the hi-tech security measure has proved controversial in some eu countries , with critics saying the scanners are too invasive .
de maiziere told the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that he was satisfied that the technology did not pose a risk to health , or privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere said that privacy and health fears had been addressed " there is no real picture of the body , " said de maiziere , adding that individuals and suspicious objects would be represented in " a schematic representation of the body , like stick men . " the scanners use waves to scan the body for explosives or weapons .
suspicious objects are marked on the monitor with a red spot .
" experts have carefully measured and ascertained that the radiation the body scanner uses poses no health hazard , " said de maiziere .
the use of the scanners , even as a test , is likely to generate lively debate within germany .
privacy concerns civil liberties groups protest that the scanners amount to an invasion of privacy , while privacy campaigners say that the technology violates european law by producing sexually explicit images .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data that could show body contours is supposed to be deleted the united states called on members of the european union to introduce scanners after a nigerian passenger tried to blow up a plane bound for chicago on christmas day last year with explosives hidden in his underwear .
us security authorities had demanded that original pictures taken by the machine - which display the contours of the body - be saved for possible later use .
however , the german interior ministry has insisted that all images be deleted after passengers pass through the airport .
extension of the technology to all german airports is not expected to take place until the middle of 2011 .
full-body scanners are already used in some eu countries , such as britain and the netherlands .
eu member states including spain and germany voiced concerns about an eu-wide introduction of the technology at a meeting of eu interior ministers earlier this year . author : richard connor -lrb- dpa / afp / dpa -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de eu ministers postpone us request for body scanners eu justice ministers have put off a request by the us to install full-body scanners at airports across europe .
studies must first confirm that the devices are safe and do n't invade privacy , the ministers say .
-lrb- 21.01.2010 -rrb- us aims to overcome europe 's doubts about airport body scanners us secretary of state for homeland security janet napolitano is meeting with eu officials in spain on thursday for talks on boosting security at european airports , including installing full-body scanners .
-lrb- 21.01.2010 -rrb- body scanners are nothing new in russia a meeting of the eu 's interior and justice ministers takes place this thursday to discuss the introduction of body scanners .
but the scanners , which show passengers naked , have been in use in russia for three years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.08.2010 in rwanda , stability trumps democracy as nation goes to polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kagame is expected to be reelected with an overwhelming majority rwandans voted monday in presidential elections , but the outcome is already all but certain .
critics of the government say the country may be stable but has moved far away from being a real democracy . rwandans went to the ballot box on monday to vote for a new president , although no one was biting their nails over the outcome - the country 's sitting president , paul kagame , was expected to win with some 90 percent of the vote .
critics say despite its democratic appearance , the election represents just another seven-year extension of kagame 's iron-fisted rule during which rwanda 's economy has flourished , but any political opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed , turning the east african nation into what amounts to a one-party state .
" after the genocide there was the appearance to a certain extent of a liberal system , but for many years one can clearly see that it 's a de facto one-party state , " denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" there are a few political parties allowed , but those represented in parliament ca n't be considered a real opposition , " he said .
monday 's vote is the second presidential election since the country was rocked with genocidal violence in 1994 that killed some 800,000 .
while the country has not seen a repeat of that horror , this election run-up has been marked by a spate of arrests , mysterious killings and restrictions on the free-speech rights of critical opposition figures that could well affect the nation 's long-term stability , and reopen the wounds left over from the genocide .
growth and stability kagame 's supporters , including many in the west , can point to a string of accomplishments during his 16 years at the top - 10 as president - beginning in those dark days in 1994 , when he helped end the wave of killing that had wracked the country .
after the genocide , the country was in ruins , today rwanda is the safest , cleanest country in africa , with no slums and almost no begging or street crime .
its economy is expected to grow 6 percent this year and tax revenues to increase by 12 percent .
kagame has positioned himself as a foe of corruption which has attracted donors and private investors , including big names like starbucks and the gulf investment firm dubai world .
berlin-based corruption watchdog transparency international ranks rwanda as the least corrupt country in east africa .
the world bank puts the country among the top five most attractive african nations to do business .
kagame 's popularity with foreign donors has meant the country 's food stocks are swelling , the chinese have built a basic road network and south korea is laying a fiber-optic system across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government often touts its successful efforts to improve the status of rwandan women his ruling rwandan patriotic front party has overseen a trebling of household incomes and today citizens have access to universal health insurance and the country 's parliament has a higher percentage of female members than anywhere else in the world - 56 percent .
" i will continue to work as hard as i can till the day we can speak of a rwanda that has achieved the kind of prosperity that leaves no one behind and everyone proud of who they are , " kagame wrote in a letter to supporters posted on his website friday .
the other side of the coin but there is a dark side to kagame 's rule , critics say , charging that all the stability has came at a high price - human rights .
over the last few months , a string of attacks on rwandans with whom the president has fallen out has raised eyebrows and suspicions .
opposition politicians and independent journalists have been harassed , arrested , or worse .
police have arrested two aspiring presidential candidates and opposition supporters have been detained for holding an illegal rally .
victoire ingabire , a hutu politician who had hoped to stand against kagame , must face charges of " denying the genocide " while in exile .
general faustin kayumba nyamwasa , a critic kagame , fled his homeland in february and was shot in the stomach in june in south africa .
the deputy editor of a critical newspaper was recently shot and killed outside his home in the capital kigali .
andre kagwa rwisereka , the deputy leader of the opposition democratic green party of rwanda , was found nearly decapitated in the south of the country .
" we have stability here and you can see economic improvement .
but we do n't think it 's sustainable , because we say stability and democracy must go hand and hand , " frank habineza , president of rwanda 's green party , told deutsche welle by telephone from kigali .
he said he himself was threatened by unnamed men in february who he suspects of being government security operatives .
" we know kagame 's party is going to win this election , because the president is very prepared and he has no competition at all , " he added .
" this election is an election where there is no opposition . "
kagame won a 2003 presidential election with 95 percent of the vote .
this time around , he faces three opponents who backed him seven years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kagame has been a darling of the west , which has overlooked much criticism western support despite the recent events , all of which the government denies having any role in , rwanda still enjoys a good deal of enthusiastic western support since the country is seen as something of a model for the continent .
kagame 's list of advisors includes tony blair , bill clinton , high-profile us evangelist rick warren and the ceos of google and starbucks .
it also helps that kagame , 52 , is an elegant , charismatic figure , who speaks well and knows how to court international players .
over the past few weeks , kagame has responded to allegations about democratic deficits by saying democracy in rwanda takes time to establish , stability is the priority , especially given the convulsion of 1994 .
" your model of democracy , why should it be suitable for me , " he told britain 's guardian newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagame has used his role in ending the 1994 genocide to his advantage foreign governments and advisors have been mostly quiet about the rights situation , despite the fact that rwanda is ranked 183 out of 195 countries for freedom of the press .
according to analyst tull , that is partly due to the fact that kagame , the rebel army leader who stopped the genocide , has successfully played on western guilt about its non-intervention during the killing .
" the government is saying , we have other goals , like stability and development , and we wo n't be told by others how to lead our country , especially by an international community which did n't intervene to stop the genocide , " he said .
" that is the message and it 's getting across fairly well because we have n't seen that much criticism from outside . "

but the university reopened in lithuania and is now a magnet for students from belarus . " the ehu is a university in exile , " maxim , a student proudly told a group of high school graduates from belarus during a tour of the european humanities university -lrb- ehu -rrb- facilities on open house day .
the ehu is located in a building on the outskirts of the lithuanian capital , vilnius , where it moved by invitation of the lithuanian government after being forcibly and abruptly closed down by the belarusian authorities in minsk six years ago .
the european commission , several eu nations and the united states also provide support to the exile university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular : the comedy club at the ehu maxim told the visiting students how important extra-curricular activities were at his university .
it has its own newspaper , several sports clubs and a team of election observers scheduled to travel to bosnia-herzegovina for this year 's parliamentary polls - the students organize everything themselves .
" any questions ? "
" please ask questions - that 's important ! "
maxim told the tour group . but in general , he knows from experience that belarus high school graduates are not used to asking questions yet , at least not questions that might not be officially desirable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art students at a lecture vilnius is just a two-hour train ride from minsk , the capital of belarus , the two countries share a border , but they are nevertheless worlds apart .
lithuania joined the european union in 2004 , while neighboring belarus has been ruled by its authoritarian president , alexander lukashenko , for the past 16 years .
two belarusian professors founded the european humanities university in minsk in 1992 , shortly after the collapse of the soviet union .
" we wanted to end decades of separation from the rest of europe , and finally establish studies free of ideology , " said anatoli mikhailov , the university 's principal .
the newly founded university quickly formed international ties ; within belarus , it soon became known for its disputatious students .
too independent protests following alexander lukashenko 's first re-election in 2001 showed that almost the entire ehu 's student body opposed the president . the university came under increasing pressure and in 2004 the country 's education ministry withdrew the ehu 's teaching permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhailov : we wanted a university free of ideology formal reasons were cited , but mikhailov said the move was clearly political .
" lukashenko always personally appointed the state universities ' heads , " he said .
" everything was under state control - except for us .
we were like an island . "
the authorities , mikhailov said , must have regarded the university as a threat to all of the country 's students . lithuanian asylum formally , ehu is a lithuanian university , but 97 percent of its roughly 2,000 students come from belarus .
they commute back and forth or get a degree via correspondence courses .
tatsiana chulitskaya , who teaches politics at the ehu , said some students chose the university for pragmatic reasons , since it is the only belarusian university to offer a european degree .
she said the b.a. was not recognized in belarus , but it allowed students to continue their studies in europe and in the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open house at the ehu katerina , 20 , studies art at the ehu .
she was not very interested in politics , and was shocked that the professors routinely encouraged the students to ask questions .
" that was something we were not used to , " she said . but now , she added , she was learning how to gather information and to form her own opinion based on that information .
that created a certain distance from her friends in belarus , she said .
" they do n't see any alternatives , they 've all got the same black-and-white point of view , and they are content as long as there 's no war , " she said next , katerina wants to get a master 's degree , either at the ehu or another european university .
in the long run she does want to return to belarus - taking with her a newly acquired ability to challenge and question the status quo .

critics of the government say the country may be stable but has moved far away from being a real democracy . rwandans went to the ballot box on monday to vote for a new president , although no one was biting their nails over the outcome - the country 's sitting president , paul kagame , was expected to win with some 90 percent of the vote .
critics say despite its democratic appearance , the election represents just another seven-year extension of kagame 's iron-fisted rule during which rwanda 's economy has flourished , but any political opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed , turning the east african nation into what amounts to a one-party state .
" after the genocide there was the appearance to a certain extent of a liberal system , but for many years one can clearly see that it 's a de facto one-party state , " denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" there are a few political parties allowed , but those represented in parliament ca n't be considered a real opposition , " he said .
monday 's vote is the second presidential election since the country was rocked with genocidal violence in 1994 that killed some 800,000 .
while the country has not seen a repeat of that horror , this election run-up has been marked by a spate of arrests , mysterious killings and restrictions on the free-speech rights of critical opposition figures that could well affect the nation 's long-term stability , and reopen the wounds left over from the genocide .
growth and stability kagame 's supporters , including many in the west , can point to a string of accomplishments during his 16 years at the top - 10 as president - beginning in those dark days in 1994 , when he helped end the wave of killing that had wracked the country .
after the genocide , the country was in ruins , today rwanda is the safest , cleanest country in africa , with no slums and almost no begging or street crime .
its economy is expected to grow 6 percent this year and tax revenues to increase by 12 percent .
kagame has positioned himself as a foe of corruption which has attracted donors and private investors , including big names like starbucks and the gulf investment firm dubai world .
berlin-based corruption watchdog transparency international ranks rwanda as the least corrupt country in east africa .
the world bank puts the country among the top five most attractive african nations to do business .
kagame 's popularity with foreign donors has meant the country 's food stocks are swelling , the chinese have built a basic road network and south korea is laying a fiber-optic system across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government often touts its successful efforts to improve the status of rwandan women his ruling rwandan patriotic front party has overseen a trebling of household incomes and today citizens have access to universal health insurance and the country 's parliament has a higher percentage of female members than anywhere else in the world - 56 percent .

the scanners have raised fears about risks to health and personal privacy . the controversial full body scanner will become a feature of life for passengers passing through german airport security within weeks as hamburg 's airport will begin using the devices next month .
early tests of the apparatus will begin in hamburg at the beginning of september , interior minister thomas de maiziere said .
the hi-tech security measure has proved controversial in some eu countries , with critics saying the scanners are too invasive .
de maiziere told the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that he was satisfied that the technology did not pose a risk to health , or privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere said that privacy and health fears had been addressed " there is no real picture of the body , " said de maiziere , adding that individuals and suspicious objects would be represented in " a schematic representation of the body , like stick men . " the scanners use waves to scan the body for explosives or weapons .
suspicious objects are marked on the monitor with a red spot .
" experts have carefully measured and ascertained that the radiation the body scanner uses poses no health hazard , " said de maiziere .
the use of the scanners , even as a test , is likely to generate lively debate within germany .
privacy concerns civil liberties groups protest that the scanners amount to an invasion of privacy , while privacy campaigners say that the technology violates european law by producing sexually explicit images .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data that could show body contours is supposed to be deleted the united states called on members of the european union to introduce scanners after a nigerian passenger tried to blow up a plane bound for chicago on christmas day last year with explosives hidden in his underwear .
us security authorities had demanded that original pictures taken by the machine - which display the contours of the body - be saved for possible later use .
however , the german interior ministry has insisted that all images be deleted after passengers pass through the airport .
extension of the technology to all german airports is not expected to take place until the middle of 2011 .
full-body scanners are already used in some eu countries , such as britain and the netherlands .
eu member states including spain and germany voiced concerns about an eu-wide introduction of the technology at a meeting of eu interior ministers earlier this year . author : richard connor -lrb- dpa / afp / dpa -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ehu is located in a building on the outskirts of the lithuanian capital , vilnius , where it moved by invitation of the lithuanian government after being forcibly and abruptly closed down by the belarusian authorities in minsk six years ago .

critics of the government say the country may be stable but has moved far away from being a real democracy . rwandans went to the ballot box on monday to vote for a new president , although no one was biting their nails over the outcome - the country 's sitting president , paul kagame , was expected to win with some 90 percent of the vote .
critics say despite its democratic appearance , the election represents just another seven-year extension of kagame 's iron-fisted rule during which rwanda 's economy has flourished , but any political opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed , turning the east african nation into what amounts to a one-party state .
" after the genocide there was the appearance to a certain extent of a liberal system , but for many years one can clearly see that it 's a de facto one-party state , " denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" there are a few political parties allowed , but those represented in parliament ca n't be considered a real opposition , " he said .
monday 's vote is the second presidential election since the country was rocked with genocidal violence in 1994 that killed some 800,000 .
while the country has not seen a repeat of that horror , this election run-up has been marked by a spate of arrests , mysterious killings and restrictions on the free-speech rights of critical opposition figures that could well affect the nation 's long-term stability , and reopen the wounds left over from the genocide .
growth and stability kagame 's supporters , including many in the west , can point to a string of accomplishments during his 16 years at the top - 10 as president - beginning in those dark days in 1994 , when he helped end the wave of killing that had wracked the country .
after the genocide , the country was in ruins , today rwanda is the safest , cleanest country in africa , with no slums and almost no begging or street crime .
its economy is expected to grow 6 percent this year and tax revenues to increase by 12 percent .
kagame has positioned himself as a foe of corruption which has attracted donors and private investors , including big names like starbucks and the gulf investment firm dubai world .
berlin-based corruption watchdog transparency international ranks rwanda as the least corrupt country in east africa .
the world bank puts the country among the top five most attractive african nations to do business .
kagame 's popularity with foreign donors has meant the country 's food stocks are swelling , the chinese have built a basic road network and south korea is laying a fiber-optic system across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government often touts its successful efforts to improve the status of rwandan women his ruling rwandan patriotic front party has overseen a trebling of household incomes and today citizens have access to universal health insurance and the country 's parliament has a higher percentage of female members than anywhere else in the world - 56 percent .
" i will continue to work as hard as i can till the day we can speak of a rwanda that has achieved the kind of prosperity that leaves no one behind and everyone proud of who they are , " kagame wrote in a letter to supporters posted on his website friday .
the other side of the coin but there is a dark side to kagame 's rule , critics say , charging that all the stability has came at a high price - human rights .
over the last few months , a string of attacks on rwandans with whom the president has fallen out has raised eyebrows and suspicions .
opposition politicians and independent journalists have been harassed , arrested , or worse .
police have arrested two aspiring presidential candidates and opposition supporters have been detained for holding an illegal rally .
victoire ingabire , a hutu politician who had hoped to stand against kagame , must face charges of " denying the genocide " while in exile .
general faustin kayumba nyamwasa , a critic kagame , fled his homeland in february and was shot in the stomach in june in south africa .
the deputy editor of a critical newspaper was recently shot and killed outside his home in the capital kigali .
andre kagwa rwisereka , the deputy leader of the opposition democratic green party of rwanda , was found nearly decapitated in the south of the country .
" we have stability here and you can see economic improvement .
but we do n't think it 's sustainable , because we say stability and democracy must go hand and hand , " frank habineza , president of rwanda 's green party , told deutsche welle by telephone from kigali .
he said he himself was threatened by unnamed men in february who he suspects of being government security operatives .
" we know kagame 's party is going to win this election , because the president is very prepared and he has no competition at all , " he added .
" this election is an election where there is no opposition . "
kagame won a 2003 presidential election with 95 percent of the vote .
this time around , he faces three opponents who backed him seven years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kagame has been a darling of the west , which has overlooked much criticism western support despite the recent events , all of which the government denies having any role in , rwanda still enjoys a good deal of enthusiastic western support since the country is seen as something of a model for the continent .
kagame 's list of advisors includes tony blair , bill clinton , high-profile us evangelist rick warren and the ceos of google and starbucks .
it also helps that kagame , 52 , is an elegant , charismatic figure , who speaks well and knows how to court international players .
over the past few weeks , kagame has responded to allegations about democratic deficits by saying democracy in rwanda takes time to establish , stability is the priority , especially given the convulsion of 1994 .
" your model of democracy , why should it be suitable for me , " he told britain 's guardian newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagame has used his role in ending the 1994 genocide to his advantage foreign governments and advisors have been mostly quiet about the rights situation , despite the fact that rwanda is ranked 183 out of 195 countries for freedom of the press .
according to analyst tull , that is partly due to the fact that kagame , the rebel army leader who stopped the genocide , has successfully played on western guilt about its non-intervention during the killing .
" the government is saying , we have other goals , like stability and development , and we wo n't be told by others how to lead our country , especially by an international community which did n't intervene to stop the genocide , " he said .
" that is the message and it 's getting across fairly well because we have n't seen that much criticism from outside . "

one of the victims was a 35-year-old german woman . the german government has condemned last week 's killing of a group of medical workers in northern afghanistan .
the bullet-ridden bodies of six americans , a german woman , a briton and two afghans were found in a remote area of the northeastern province of badakhshan on friday .
the bodies have since been flown to the afghan capital kabul for formal identification .
authorities in berlin have given more details about the german victim of the attack .
the 35-year-old woman from chemnitz , in the eastern state of saxony , has been identified as translator daniela b ..
the us embassy in kabul said on sunday that six of the slain aid workers in northern afghanistan were identified by a forensic investigation as us nationals .
us secretary of state hillary clinton has condemned the killings as a " senseless act " against " heroic , generous people . "
the victims were part of a 12-member medical team working for a christian charity called the international assistance mission -lrb- iam -rrb- .
they were mainly involved in providing eye care in remote regions .
' bad setback ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin said the attack showed the volatility of the situation in afghanistan politicians in germany have been quick to condemn the attack .
the government called for a " thorough clarification of such a cowardly murder . "
juergen trittin , the head of the parliamentary faction of germany 's opposition green party , echoed the anger of his political rivals .
" it 's shocking that even people who clearly have nothing to do with the military , doctors who were helping people , have become the target of such an attack .
that shows how unstable the situation is in afghanistan today , " he said .
ulrich post , head of the umbrella aid group venro in germany described the attack as a " really bad setback " for humanitarian work in afghanistan .
it was " already very difficult to recruit qualified personnel for aid missions in afghanistan , " post told german newspaper hannoversche allgemeine .
" now it will be even more difficult , " he said .
sam zarifi from the human rights organization amnesty international echoed the view .
" certainly , this is one of the worst attacks ever on aid workers in afghanistan .
keep in mind that at least for the last three decades , it has been basically aid workers who have serviced the afghan people 's basic needs - not the afghan government or foreign governments , " zarifi said in an interview with the bbc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international assistance mission has denied trying to convert muslims to christianity groups denies it tried to convert people the taliban claimed responsibility for the killings , accusing the victims of being spies and christian missionaries .
they said the charity had been seeking to convert muslims to christianity , a charge which dirk frans , executive director of iam , has strongly denied .
" the accusation is completely baseless .
they were not carrying any bibles except maybe their personal bibles , " frans told news agency reuters .
" as an organization we are not involved in proselytizing at all .
" i like people who stand for a cause , but i think you really need to reflect on what you 're communicating to people - and this would be my suggestion to the taliban .
think about what you 're doing .
is this the best way of serving god ? " he said .
abdullah abdullah , a senior afghan politician and former presidential candidate who trained as an eye surgeon with one of the medical workers , also dismissed the taliban 's claims as " ridiculous . "
police investigating driver the driver of the convoy in which the medical workers were traveling was arrested on sunday .
police said he was being questioned as part of investigations into the killings .
violence in afghanistan is at its worst since the us-led forces overthrew the taliban in 2001 .
june was the deadliest month of the war for foreign forces , with over 100 killed .
deaths of civilians have also risen dramatically , according to the afghan independent human rights commission -lrb- aihrc -rrb- .
they said 1,325 civilians died in the first seven months of 2010 .

but the university reopened in lithuania and is now a magnet for students from belarus . " the ehu is a university in exile , " maxim , a student proudly told a group of high school graduates from belarus during a tour of the european humanities university -lrb- ehu -rrb- facilities on open house day .
the ehu is located in a building on the outskirts of the lithuanian capital , vilnius , where it moved by invitation of the lithuanian government after being forcibly and abruptly closed down by the belarusian authorities in minsk six years ago .
the european commission , several eu nations and the united states also provide support to the exile university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular : the comedy club at the ehu maxim told the visiting students how important extra-curricular activities were at his university .
it has its own newspaper , several sports clubs and a team of election observers scheduled to travel to bosnia-herzegovina for this year 's parliamentary polls - the students organize everything themselves .
" any questions ? "
" please ask questions - that 's important ! "
maxim told the tour group . but in general , he knows from experience that belarus high school graduates are not used to asking questions yet , at least not questions that might not be officially desirable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art students at a lecture vilnius is just a two-hour train ride from minsk , the capital of belarus , the two countries share a border , but they are nevertheless worlds apart .
lithuania joined the european union in 2004 , while neighboring belarus has been ruled by its authoritarian president , alexander lukashenko , for the past 16 years .
two belarusian professors founded the european humanities university in minsk in 1992 , shortly after the collapse of the soviet union .
" we wanted to end decades of separation from the rest of europe , and finally establish studies free of ideology , " said anatoli mikhailov , the university 's principal .
the newly founded university quickly formed international ties ; within belarus , it soon became known for its disputatious students .
too independent protests following alexander lukashenko 's first re-election in 2001 showed that almost the entire ehu 's student body opposed the president . the university came under increasing pressure and in 2004 the country 's education ministry withdrew the ehu 's teaching permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhailov : we wanted a university free of ideology formal reasons were cited , but mikhailov said the move was clearly political .
" lukashenko always personally appointed the state universities ' heads , " he said .
" everything was under state control - except for us .
we were like an island . "
the authorities , mikhailov said , must have regarded the university as a threat to all of the country 's students . lithuanian asylum formally , ehu is a lithuanian university , but 97 percent of its roughly 2,000 students come from belarus .
they commute back and forth or get a degree via correspondence courses .
tatsiana chulitskaya , who teaches politics at the ehu , said some students chose the university for pragmatic reasons , since it is the only belarusian university to offer a european degree .
she said the b.a. was not recognized in belarus , but it allowed students to continue their studies in europe and in the us .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : open house at the ehu katerina , 20 , studies art at the ehu .
she was not very interested in politics , and was shocked that the professors routinely encouraged the students to ask questions .
" that was something we were not used to , " she said . but now , she added , she was learning how to gather information and to form her own opinion based on that information .
that created a certain distance from her friends in belarus , she said .
" they do n't see any alternatives , they 've all got the same black-and-white point of view , and they are content as long as there 's no war , " she said next , katerina wants to get a master 's degree , either at the ehu or another european university .
in the long run she does want to return to belarus - taking with her a newly acquired ability to challenge and question the status quo .

critics of the government say the country may be stable but has moved far away from being a real democracy . rwandans went to the ballot box on monday to vote for a new president , although no one was biting their nails over the outcome - the country 's sitting president , paul kagame , was expected to win with some 90 percent of the vote .
critics say despite its democratic appearance , the election represents just another seven-year extension of kagame 's iron-fisted rule during which rwanda 's economy has flourished , but any political opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed , turning the east african nation into what amounts to a one-party state .
" after the genocide there was the appearance to a certain extent of a liberal system , but for many years one can clearly see that it 's a de facto one-party state , " denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" there are a few political parties allowed , but those represented in parliament ca n't be considered a real opposition , " he said .
monday 's vote is the second presidential election since the country was rocked with genocidal violence in 1994 that killed some 800,000 .
while the country has not seen a repeat of that horror , this election run-up has been marked by a spate of arrests , mysterious killings and restrictions on the free-speech rights of critical opposition figures that could well affect the nation 's long-term stability , and reopen the wounds left over from the genocide .
growth and stability kagame 's supporters , including many in the west , can point to a string of accomplishments during his 16 years at the top - 10 as president - beginning in those dark days in 1994 , when he helped end the wave of killing that had wracked the country .
after the genocide , the country was in ruins , today rwanda is the safest , cleanest country in africa , with no slums and almost no begging or street crime .
its economy is expected to grow 6 percent this year and tax revenues to increase by 12 percent .

berlin-based corruption watchdog transparency international ranks rwanda as the least corrupt country in east africa .
the world bank puts the country among the top five most attractive african nations to do business .
kagame 's popularity with foreign donors has meant the country 's food stocks are swelling , the chinese have built a basic road network and south korea is laying a fiber-optic system across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government often touts its successful efforts to improve the status of rwandan women his ruling rwandan patriotic front party has overseen a trebling of household incomes and today citizens have access to universal health insurance and the country 's parliament has a higher percentage of female members than anywhere else in the world - 56 percent .
" i will continue to work as hard as i can till the day we can speak of a rwanda that has achieved the kind of prosperity that leaves no one behind and everyone proud of who they are , " kagame wrote in a letter to supporters posted on his website friday .
the other side of the coin but there is a dark side to kagame 's rule , critics say , charging that all the stability has came at a high price - human rights .
over the last few months , a string of attacks on rwandans with whom the president has fallen out has raised eyebrows and suspicions .

he said he himself was threatened by unnamed men in february who he suspects of being government security operatives .
" we know kagame 's party is going to win this election , because the president is very prepared and he has no competition at all , " he added .
" this election is an election where there is no opposition . "

it also helps that kagame , 52 , is an elegant , charismatic figure , who speaks well and knows how to court international players .
over the past few weeks , kagame has responded to allegations about democratic deficits by saying democracy in rwanda takes time to establish , stability is the priority , especially given the convulsion of 1994 .
" your model of democracy , why should it be suitable for me , " he told britain 's guardian newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagame has used his role in ending the 1994 genocide to his advantage foreign governments and advisors have been mostly quiet about the rights situation , despite the fact that rwanda is ranked 183 out of 195 countries for freedom of the press .
according to analyst tull , that is partly due to the fact that kagame , the rebel army leader who stopped the genocide , has successfully played on western guilt about its non-intervention during the killing .
" the government is saying , we have other goals , like stability and development , and we wo n't be told by others how to lead our country , especially by an international community which did n't intervene to stop the genocide , " he said .
" that is the message and it 's getting across fairly well because we have n't seen that much criticism from outside . "

critics of the government say the country may be stable but has moved far away from being a real democracy . rwandans went to the ballot box on monday to vote for a new president , although no one was biting their nails over the outcome - the country 's sitting president , paul kagame , was expected to win with some 90 percent of the vote .
critics say despite its democratic appearance , the election represents just another seven-year extension of kagame 's iron-fisted rule during which rwanda 's economy has flourished , but any political opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed , turning the east african nation into what amounts to a one-party state .
" after the genocide there was the appearance to a certain extent of a liberal system , but for many years one can clearly see that it 's a de facto one-party state , " denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" there are a few political parties allowed , but those represented in parliament ca n't be considered a real opposition , " he said .
monday 's vote is the second presidential election since the country was rocked with genocidal violence in 1994 that killed some 800,000 .
while the country has not seen a repeat of that horror , this election run-up has been marked by a spate of arrests , mysterious killings and restrictions on the free-speech rights of critical opposition figures that could well affect the nation 's long-term stability , and reopen the wounds left over from the genocide .
growth and stability kagame 's supporters , including many in the west , can point to a string of accomplishments during his 16 years at the top - 10 as president - beginning in those dark days in 1994 , when he helped end the wave of killing that had wracked the country .
after the genocide , the country was in ruins , today rwanda is the safest , cleanest country in africa , with no slums and almost no begging or street crime .
its economy is expected to grow 6 percent this year and tax revenues to increase by 12 percent .
kagame has positioned himself as a foe of corruption which has attracted donors and private investors , including big names like starbucks and the gulf investment firm dubai world .
berlin-based corruption watchdog transparency international ranks rwanda as the least corrupt country in east africa .
the world bank puts the country among the top five most attractive african nations to do business .
kagame 's popularity with foreign donors has meant the country 's food stocks are swelling , the chinese have built a basic road network and south korea is laying a fiber-optic system across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government often touts its successful efforts to improve the status of rwandan women his ruling rwandan patriotic front party has overseen a trebling of household incomes and today citizens have access to universal health insurance and the country 's parliament has a higher percentage of female members than anywhere else in the world - 56 percent .
" i will continue to work as hard as i can till the day we can speak of a rwanda that has achieved the kind of prosperity that leaves no one behind and everyone proud of who they are , " kagame wrote in a letter to supporters posted on his website friday .
the other side of the coin but there is a dark side to kagame 's rule , critics say , charging that all the stability has came at a high price - human rights .
over the last few months , a string of attacks on rwandans with whom the president has fallen out has raised eyebrows and suspicions .
opposition politicians and independent journalists have been harassed , arrested , or worse .
police have arrested two aspiring presidential candidates and opposition supporters have been detained for holding an illegal rally .
victoire ingabire , a hutu politician who had hoped to stand against kagame , must face charges of " denying the genocide " while in exile .
general faustin kayumba nyamwasa , a critic kagame , fled his homeland in february and was shot in the stomach in june in south africa .
the deputy editor of a critical newspaper was recently shot and killed outside his home in the capital kigali .
andre kagwa rwisereka , the deputy leader of the opposition democratic green party of rwanda , was found nearly decapitated in the south of the country .
" we have stability here and you can see economic improvement .
but we do n't think it 's sustainable , because we say stability and democracy must go hand and hand , " frank habineza , president of rwanda 's green party , told deutsche welle by telephone from kigali .
he said he himself was threatened by unnamed men in february who he suspects of being government security operatives .
" we know kagame 's party is going to win this election , because the president is very prepared and he has no competition at all , " he added .
" this election is an election where there is no opposition . "
kagame won a 2003 presidential election with 95 percent of the vote .
this time around , he faces three opponents who backed him seven years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kagame has been a darling of the west , which has overlooked much criticism western support despite the recent events , all of which the government denies having any role in , rwanda still enjoys a good deal of enthusiastic western support since the country is seen as something of a model for the continent .
kagame 's list of advisors includes tony blair , bill clinton , high-profile us evangelist rick warren and the ceos of google and starbucks .
it also helps that kagame , 52 , is an elegant , charismatic figure , who speaks well and knows how to court international players .
over the past few weeks , kagame has responded to allegations about democratic deficits by saying democracy in rwanda takes time to establish , stability is the priority , especially given the convulsion of 1994 .
" your model of democracy , why should it be suitable for me , " he told britain 's guardian newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagame has used his role in ending the 1994 genocide to his advantage foreign governments and advisors have been mostly quiet about the rights situation , despite the fact that rwanda is ranked 183 out of 195 countries for freedom of the press .
according to analyst tull , that is partly due to the fact that kagame , the rebel army leader who stopped the genocide , has successfully played on western guilt about its non-intervention during the killing .
" the government is saying , we have other goals , like stability and development , and we wo n't be told by others how to lead our country , especially by an international community which did n't intervene to stop the genocide , " he said .
" that is the message and it 's getting across fairly well because we have n't seen that much criticism from outside . "

critics of the government say the country may be stable but has moved far away from being a real democracy . rwandans went to the ballot box on monday to vote for a new president , although no one was biting their nails over the outcome - the country 's sitting president , paul kagame , was expected to win with some 90 percent of the vote .
critics say despite its democratic appearance , the election represents just another seven-year extension of kagame 's iron-fisted rule during which rwanda 's economy has flourished , but any political opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed , turning the east african nation into what amounts to a one-party state .
" after the genocide there was the appearance to a certain extent of a liberal system , but for many years one can clearly see that it 's a de facto one-party state , " denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" there are a few political parties allowed , but those represented in parliament ca n't be considered a real opposition , " he said .
monday 's vote is the second presidential election since the country was rocked with genocidal violence in 1994 that killed some 800,000 .
while the country has not seen a repeat of that horror , this election run-up has been marked by a spate of arrests , mysterious killings and restrictions on the free-speech rights of critical opposition figures that could well affect the nation 's long-term stability , and reopen the wounds left over from the genocide .
growth and stability kagame 's supporters , including many in the west , can point to a string of accomplishments during his 16 years at the top - 10 as president - beginning in those dark days in 1994 , when he helped end the wave of killing that had wracked the country .
after the genocide , the country was in ruins , today rwanda is the safest , cleanest country in africa , with no slums and almost no begging or street crime .
its economy is expected to grow 6 percent this year and tax revenues to increase by 12 percent .
kagame has positioned himself as a foe of corruption which has attracted donors and private investors , including big names like starbucks and the gulf investment firm dubai world .
berlin-based corruption watchdog transparency international ranks rwanda as the least corrupt country in east africa .
the world bank puts the country among the top five most attractive african nations to do business .
kagame 's popularity with foreign donors has meant the country 's food stocks are swelling , the chinese have built a basic road network and south korea is laying a fiber-optic system across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government often touts its successful efforts to improve the status of rwandan women his ruling rwandan patriotic front party has overseen a trebling of household incomes and today citizens have access to universal health insurance and the country 's parliament has a higher percentage of female members than anywhere else in the world - 56 percent .
" i will continue to work as hard as i can till the day we can speak of a rwanda that has achieved the kind of prosperity that leaves no one behind and everyone proud of who they are , " kagame wrote in a letter to supporters posted on his website friday .
the other side of the coin but there is a dark side to kagame 's rule , critics say , charging that all the stability has came at a high price - human rights .
over the last few months , a string of attacks on rwandans with whom the president has fallen out has raised eyebrows and suspicions .
opposition politicians and independent journalists have been harassed , arrested , or worse .
police have arrested two aspiring presidential candidates and opposition supporters have been detained for holding an illegal rally .
victoire ingabire , a hutu politician who had hoped to stand against kagame , must face charges of " denying the genocide " while in exile .
general faustin kayumba nyamwasa , a critic kagame , fled his homeland in february and was shot in the stomach in june in south africa .
the deputy editor of a critical newspaper was recently shot and killed outside his home in the capital kigali .
andre kagwa rwisereka , the deputy leader of the opposition democratic green party of rwanda , was found nearly decapitated in the south of the country .
" we have stability here and you can see economic improvement .
but we do n't think it 's sustainable , because we say stability and democracy must go hand and hand , " frank habineza , president of rwanda 's green party , told deutsche welle by telephone from kigali .
he said he himself was threatened by unnamed men in february who he suspects of being government security operatives .
" we know kagame 's party is going to win this election , because the president is very prepared and he has no competition at all , " he added .
" this election is an election where there is no opposition . "
kagame won a 2003 presidential election with 95 percent of the vote .
this time around , he faces three opponents who backed him seven years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kagame has been a darling of the west , which has overlooked much criticism western support despite the recent events , all of which the government denies having any role in , rwanda still enjoys a good deal of enthusiastic western support since the country is seen as something of a model for the continent .
kagame 's list of advisors includes tony blair , bill clinton , high-profile us evangelist rick warren and the ceos of google and starbucks .
it also helps that kagame , 52 , is an elegant , charismatic figure , who speaks well and knows how to court international players .
over the past few weeks , kagame has responded to allegations about democratic deficits by saying democracy in rwanda takes time to establish , stability is the priority , especially given the convulsion of 1994 .
" your model of democracy , why should it be suitable for me , " he told britain 's guardian newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagame has used his role in ending the 1994 genocide to his advantage foreign governments and advisors have been mostly quiet about the rights situation , despite the fact that rwanda is ranked 183 out of 195 countries for freedom of the press .
according to analyst tull , that is partly due to the fact that kagame , the rebel army leader who stopped the genocide , has successfully played on western guilt about its non-intervention during the killing .
" the government is saying , we have other goals , like stability and development , and we wo n't be told by others how to lead our country , especially by an international community which did n't intervene to stop the genocide , " he said .
" that is the message and it 's getting across fairly well because we have n't seen that much criticism from outside . "

the scanners have raised fears about risks to health and personal privacy . the controversial full body scanner will become a feature of life for passengers passing through german airport security within weeks as hamburg 's airport will begin using the devices next month .
early tests of the apparatus will begin in hamburg at the beginning of september , interior minister thomas de maiziere said .
the hi-tech security measure has proved controversial in some eu countries , with critics saying the scanners are too invasive .
de maiziere told the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that he was satisfied that the technology did not pose a risk to health , or privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere said that privacy and health fears had been addressed " there is no real picture of the body , " said de maiziere , adding that individuals and suspicious objects would be represented in " a schematic representation of the body , like stick men . " the scanners use waves to scan the body for explosives or weapons .
suspicious objects are marked on the monitor with a red spot .
" experts have carefully measured and ascertained that the radiation the body scanner uses poses no health hazard , " said de maiziere .
the use of the scanners , even as a test , is likely to generate lively debate within germany .
privacy concerns civil liberties groups protest that the scanners amount to an invasion of privacy , while privacy campaigners say that the technology violates european law by producing sexually explicit images .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data that could show body contours is supposed to be deleted the united states called on members of the european union to introduce scanners after a nigerian passenger tried to blow up a plane bound for chicago on christmas day last year with explosives hidden in his underwear .
us security authorities had demanded that original pictures taken by the machine - which display the contours of the body - be saved for possible later use .
however , the german interior ministry has insisted that all images be deleted after passengers pass through the airport .
extension of the technology to all german airports is not expected to take place until the middle of 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 08.08.2010 in rwanda , stability trumps democracy as nation goes to polls großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kagame is expected to be reelected with an overwhelming majority rwandans voted monday in presidential elections , but the outcome is already all but certain .
critics of the government say the country may be stable but has moved far away from being a real democracy . rwandans went to the ballot box on monday to vote for a new president , although no one was biting their nails over the outcome - the country 's sitting president , paul kagame , was expected to win with some 90 percent of the vote .
critics say despite its democratic appearance , the election represents just another seven-year extension of kagame 's iron-fisted rule during which rwanda 's economy has flourished , but any political opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed , turning the east african nation into what amounts to a one-party state .
" after the genocide there was the appearance to a certain extent of a liberal system , but for many years one can clearly see that it 's a de facto one-party state , " denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" there are a few political parties allowed , but those represented in parliament ca n't be considered a real opposition , " he said .
monday 's vote is the second presidential election since the country was rocked with genocidal violence in 1994 that killed some 800,000 .
while the country has not seen a repeat of that horror , this election run-up has been marked by a spate of arrests , mysterious killings and restrictions on the free-speech rights of critical opposition figures that could well affect the nation 's long-term stability , and reopen the wounds left over from the genocide .
growth and stability kagame 's supporters , including many in the west , can point to a string of accomplishments during his 16 years at the top - 10 as president - beginning in those dark days in 1994 , when he helped end the wave of killing that had wracked the country .
after the genocide , the country was in ruins , today rwanda is the safest , cleanest country in africa , with no slums and almost no begging or street crime .
its economy is expected to grow 6 percent this year and tax revenues to increase by 12 percent .
kagame has positioned himself as a foe of corruption which has attracted donors and private investors , including big names like starbucks and the gulf investment firm dubai world .
berlin-based corruption watchdog transparency international ranks rwanda as the least corrupt country in east africa .
the world bank puts the country among the top five most attractive african nations to do business .
kagame 's popularity with foreign donors has meant the country 's food stocks are swelling , the chinese have built a basic road network and south korea is laying a fiber-optic system across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government often touts its successful efforts to improve the status of rwandan women his ruling rwandan patriotic front party has overseen a trebling of household incomes and today citizens have access to universal health insurance and the country 's parliament has a higher percentage of female members than anywhere else in the world - 56 percent .
" i will continue to work as hard as i can till the day we can speak of a rwanda that has achieved the kind of prosperity that leaves no one behind and everyone proud of who they are , " kagame wrote in a letter to supporters posted on his website friday .
the other side of the coin but there is a dark side to kagame 's rule , critics say , charging that all the stability has came at a high price - human rights .
over the last few months , a string of attacks on rwandans with whom the president has fallen out has raised eyebrows and suspicions .
opposition politicians and independent journalists have been harassed , arrested , or worse .
police have arrested two aspiring presidential candidates and opposition supporters have been detained for holding an illegal rally .
victoire ingabire , a hutu politician who had hoped to stand against kagame , must face charges of " denying the genocide " while in exile .
general faustin kayumba nyamwasa , a critic kagame , fled his homeland in february and was shot in the stomach in june in south africa .
the deputy editor of a critical newspaper was recently shot and killed outside his home in the capital kigali .
andre kagwa rwisereka , the deputy leader of the opposition democratic green party of rwanda , was found nearly decapitated in the south of the country .
" we have stability here and you can see economic improvement .
but we do n't think it 's sustainable , because we say stability and democracy must go hand and hand , " frank habineza , president of rwanda 's green party , told deutsche welle by telephone from kigali .
he said he himself was threatened by unnamed men in february who he suspects of being government security operatives .
" we know kagame 's party is going to win this election , because the president is very prepared and he has no competition at all , " he added .
" this election is an election where there is no opposition . "
kagame won a 2003 presidential election with 95 percent of the vote .
this time around , he faces three opponents who backed him seven years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paul kagame has been a darling of the west , which has overlooked much criticism western support despite the recent events , all of which the government denies having any role in , rwanda still enjoys a good deal of enthusiastic western support since the country is seen as something of a model for the continent .
kagame 's list of advisors includes tony blair , bill clinton , high-profile us evangelist rick warren and the ceos of google and starbucks .
it also helps that kagame , 52 , is an elegant , charismatic figure , who speaks well and knows how to court international players .
over the past few weeks , kagame has responded to allegations about democratic deficits by saying democracy in rwanda takes time to establish , stability is the priority , especially given the convulsion of 1994 .
" your model of democracy , why should it be suitable for me , " he told britain 's guardian newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagame has used his role in ending the 1994 genocide to his advantage foreign governments and advisors have been mostly quiet about the rights situation , despite the fact that rwanda is ranked 183 out of 195 countries for freedom of the press .
according to analyst tull , that is partly due to the fact that kagame , the rebel army leader who stopped the genocide , has successfully played on western guilt about its non-intervention during the killing .
" the government is saying , we have other goals , like stability and development , and we wo n't be told by others how to lead our country , especially by an international community which did n't intervene to stop the genocide , " he said .
" that is the message and it 's getting across fairly well because we have n't seen that much criticism from outside . "

critics of the government say the country may be stable but has moved far away from being a real democracy . rwandans went to the ballot box on monday to vote for a new president , although no one was biting their nails over the outcome - the country 's sitting president , paul kagame , was expected to win with some 90 percent of the vote .
critics say despite its democratic appearance , the election represents just another seven-year extension of kagame 's iron-fisted rule during which rwanda 's economy has flourished , but any political opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed , turning the east african nation into what amounts to a one-party state .
" after the genocide there was the appearance to a certain extent of a liberal system , but for many years one can clearly see that it 's a de facto one-party state , " denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" there are a few political parties allowed , but those represented in parliament ca n't be considered a real opposition , " he said .
monday 's vote is the second presidential election since the country was rocked with genocidal violence in 1994 that killed some 800,000 .
while the country has not seen a repeat of that horror , this election run-up has been marked by a spate of arrests , mysterious killings and restrictions on the free-speech rights of critical opposition figures that could well affect the nation 's long-term stability , and reopen the wounds left over from the genocide .
growth and stability kagame 's supporters , including many in the west , can point to a string of accomplishments during his 16 years at the top - 10 as president - beginning in those dark days in 1994 , when he helped end the wave of killing that had wracked the country .
after the genocide , the country was in ruins , today rwanda is the safest , cleanest country in africa , with no slums and almost no begging or street crime .
its economy is expected to grow 6 percent this year and tax revenues to increase by 12 percent .
kagame has positioned himself as a foe of corruption which has attracted donors and private investors , including big names like starbucks and the gulf investment firm dubai world .
berlin-based corruption watchdog transparency international ranks rwanda as the least corrupt country in east africa .
the world bank puts the country among the top five most attractive african nations to do business .
kagame 's popularity with foreign donors has meant the country 's food stocks are swelling , the chinese have built a basic road network and south korea is laying a fiber-optic system across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government often touts its successful efforts to improve the status of rwandan women his ruling rwandan patriotic front party has overseen a trebling of household incomes and today citizens have access to universal health insurance and the country 's parliament has a higher percentage of female members than anywhere else in the world - 56 percent .
" i will continue to work as hard as i can till the day we can speak of a rwanda that has achieved the kind of prosperity that leaves no one behind and everyone proud of who they are , " kagame wrote in a letter to supporters posted on his website friday .
the other side of the coin but there is a dark side to kagame 's rule , critics say , charging that all the stability has came at a high price - human rights .
over the last few months , a string of attacks on rwandans with whom the president has fallen out has raised eyebrows and suspicions .
opposition politicians and independent journalists have been harassed , arrested , or worse .
police have arrested two aspiring presidential candidates and opposition supporters have been detained for holding an illegal rally .
victoire ingabire , a hutu politician who had hoped to stand against kagame , must face charges of " denying the genocide " while in exile .
general faustin kayumba nyamwasa , a critic kagame , fled his homeland in february and was shot in the stomach in june in south africa .
the deputy editor of a critical newspaper was recently shot and killed outside his home in the capital kigali .
andre kagwa rwisereka , the deputy leader of the opposition democratic green party of rwanda , was found nearly decapitated in the south of the country .
" we have stability here and you can see economic improvement .
but we do n't think it 's sustainable , because we say stability and democracy must go hand and hand , " frank habineza , president of rwanda 's green party , told deutsche welle by telephone from kigali .
he said he himself was threatened by unnamed men in february who he suspects of being government security operatives .
" we know kagame 's party is going to win this election , because the president is very prepared and he has no competition at all , " he added .
" this election is an election where there is no opposition . "
kagame won a 2003 presidential election with 95 percent of the vote .
this time around , he faces three opponents who backed him seven years ago .

loverboys , now also a phenomenon in germany , are pimps who snare victims as lovers before forcing them into prostitution . pimps who coax teenage girls into relationships and then force them into prostitution have become so common that dutch police gave the pimps a name - " loverboys . " an estimated 5,000 young women in the country are believed to be victims of the tactic .
a group called stop loverboys now , founded in 2008 , has helped more than a hundred girls . earlier this year , the organization opened an office in germany where it is currently supporting four girls who fell prey to loverboys as well as several parents whose daughters were victims . appear genuine at first for girls like merel van groningen , back in the netherlands , these abusive relationships appeared to be genuine at first .
merel was 15 years old - and vulnerable - when she met mike , a man 10 years older than her . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls start out believing they have found romance " he was my first boyfriend , so i had nothing to compare him with .
he made me feel good about myself , " merel told deutsche welle . " my father had found a new girlfriend back then and my mother also had started a new family and i did n't feel welcome by either of them .
but i felt at home when i was with mike .
he did everything for me .
he said he would take care of me . " merel ignored appeals from her mother , who told her that mike was not good for her . but before long , her new partner was asking her to sleep with other men for money .
indeed , mike was also prepared to go to extraordinary lengths to make her comply . threatened and starved he threatened merel with a gun and deprived her of food until , feeling increasingly dependent upon him , she finally accepted prostitution as a way of life without ever earning a cent . methods adopted by loverboys are varied , according to anita de witt , head of stop loverboys now . some tell the girl that sleeping with a stranger just a one-time thing to help pay a debt - otherwise their sweetheart will end up in jail .
others acquire naked footage of them on camera so that they can blackmail the girls , saying they will post the material on the internet if they do n't sleep with other men . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : victims are threatened with exposure on the internet , or violence regardless of the approach , one thing is common - the young women fall deeply in love and are made to believe the loverboy is all they have in the world . the press office of the amsterdam police said it could not provide official numbers of victims or perpetrators , something that de witt said was understandable . " there are a lot of girls who are afraid , " she said .
" they 're afraid something will happen to the parents or their brother or their sister and that 's why they do n't want to talk . " a peculiar kind of loyalty journalist maria genova , who published a book about loverboys this year , has found that , despite everything , most victims remain loyal to their loverboys . " there is support but a lot of these women do n't want to be helped because they do n't believe they are victims .
it 's so strange , " she said . " they really try to protect the loverboy , " she added .
" a lot of times after they get help they are still so in love with them that they go back to him . " genova added that , in her opinion , the jail sentences given to such men are usually rather light - between two and three years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merel stood in a shop window as her price was negotiated merel ended up working as a prostitute for her loverboy for two months and said she would never forget the first time she stood in front of men negotiating her price . " you 're behind a window in your underwear .
you feel very small because you 're in your underwear and everyone 's looking at you , " she said .
" then you 're only worth 20 euros for the man you thought loved you . " helped to escape eventually a nearby shop owner realized merel was underage and helped her escape .
she returned home and never saw mike again but wrote a book , " misled , " which was published four years ago . although the experience of recording her memories may have proved cathartic , the mental scars still remain for merel .
mike was never brought to justice and she harbors fears that her past could catch up with her . " if someone comes to my place to fix something i make sure that i 'm close enough to the door so that i can run away any moment , " she said . " if i 'm talking about it like for an interview i always look around to ensure no one knows me .

the scanners have raised fears about risks to health and personal privacy . the controversial full body scanner will become a feature of life for passengers passing through german airport security within weeks as hamburg 's airport will begin using the devices next month .
early tests of the apparatus will begin in hamburg at the beginning of september , interior minister thomas de maiziere said .
the hi-tech security measure has proved controversial in some eu countries , with critics saying the scanners are too invasive .
de maiziere told the german sunday newspaper bild am sonntag that he was satisfied that the technology did not pose a risk to health , or privacy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de maiziere said that privacy and health fears had been addressed " there is no real picture of the body , " said de maiziere , adding that individuals and suspicious objects would be represented in " a schematic representation of the body , like stick men . " the scanners use waves to scan the body for explosives or weapons .
suspicious objects are marked on the monitor with a red spot .
" experts have carefully measured and ascertained that the radiation the body scanner uses poses no health hazard , " said de maiziere .
the use of the scanners , even as a test , is likely to generate lively debate within germany .
privacy concerns civil liberties groups protest that the scanners amount to an invasion of privacy , while privacy campaigners say that the technology violates european law by producing sexually explicit images .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data that could show body contours is supposed to be deleted the united states called on members of the european union to introduce scanners after a nigerian passenger tried to blow up a plane bound for chicago on christmas day last year with explosives hidden in his underwear .
us security authorities had demanded that original pictures taken by the machine - which display the contours of the body - be saved for possible later use .
however , the german interior ministry has insisted that all images be deleted after passengers pass through the airport .
extension of the technology to all german airports is not expected to take place until the middle of 2011 .
full-body scanners are already used in some eu countries , such as britain and the netherlands .
eu member states including spain and germany voiced concerns about an eu-wide introduction of the technology at a meeting of eu interior ministers earlier this year . author : richard connor -lrb- dpa / afp / dpa -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

studies must first confirm that the devices are safe and do n't invade privacy , the ministers say .

early tests of the apparatus will begin in hamburg at the beginning of september , interior minister thomas de maiziere said .

but the university reopened in lithuania and is now a magnet for students from belarus . " the ehu is a university in exile , " maxim , a student proudly told a group of high school graduates from belarus during a tour of the european humanities university -lrb- ehu -rrb- facilities on open house day .
the ehu is located in a building on the outskirts of the lithuanian capital , vilnius , where it moved by invitation of the lithuanian government after being forcibly and abruptly closed down by the belarusian authorities in minsk six years ago .
the european commission , several eu nations and the united states also provide support to the exile university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : popular : the comedy club at the ehu maxim told the visiting students how important extra-curricular activities were at his university .
it has its own newspaper , several sports clubs and a team of election observers scheduled to travel to bosnia-herzegovina for this year 's parliamentary polls - the students organize everything themselves .
" any questions ? "
" please ask questions - that 's important ! "
maxim told the tour group . but in general , he knows from experience that belarus high school graduates are not used to asking questions yet , at least not questions that might not be officially desirable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : art students at a lecture vilnius is just a two-hour train ride from minsk , the capital of belarus , the two countries share a border , but they are nevertheless worlds apart .
lithuania joined the european union in 2004 , while neighboring belarus has been ruled by its authoritarian president , alexander lukashenko , for the past 16 years .
two belarusian professors founded the european humanities university in minsk in 1992 , shortly after the collapse of the soviet union .
" we wanted to end decades of separation from the rest of europe , and finally establish studies free of ideology , " said anatoli mikhailov , the university 's principal .
the newly founded university quickly formed international ties ; within belarus , it soon became known for its disputatious students .
too independent protests following alexander lukashenko 's first re-election in 2001 showed that almost the entire ehu 's student body opposed the president . the university came under increasing pressure and in 2004 the country 's education ministry withdrew the ehu 's teaching permit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhailov : we wanted a university free of ideology formal reasons were cited , but mikhailov said the move was clearly political .
" lukashenko always personally appointed the state universities ' heads , " he said .
" everything was under state control - except for us .
we were like an island . "
the authorities , mikhailov said , must have regarded the university as a threat to all of the country 's students . lithuanian asylum formally , ehu is a lithuanian university , but 97 percent of its roughly 2,000 students come from belarus .
they commute back and forth or get a degree via correspondence courses .

one of the victims was a 35-year-old german woman . the german government has condemned last week 's killing of a group of medical workers in northern afghanistan .
the bullet-ridden bodies of six americans , a german woman , a briton and two afghans were found in a remote area of the northeastern province of badakhshan on friday .
the bodies have since been flown to the afghan capital kabul for formal identification .
authorities in berlin have given more details about the german victim of the attack .
the 35-year-old woman from chemnitz , in the eastern state of saxony , has been identified as translator daniela b ..
the us embassy in kabul said on sunday that six of the slain aid workers in northern afghanistan were identified by a forensic investigation as us nationals .
us secretary of state hillary clinton has condemned the killings as a " senseless act " against " heroic , generous people . "
the victims were part of a 12-member medical team working for a christian charity called the international assistance mission -lrb- iam -rrb- .
they were mainly involved in providing eye care in remote regions .
' bad setback ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin said the attack showed the volatility of the situation in afghanistan politicians in germany have been quick to condemn the attack .
the government called for a " thorough clarification of such a cowardly murder . "
juergen trittin , the head of the parliamentary faction of germany 's opposition green party , echoed the anger of his political rivals .
" it 's shocking that even people who clearly have nothing to do with the military , doctors who were helping people , have become the target of such an attack .
that shows how unstable the situation is in afghanistan today , " he said .
ulrich post , head of the umbrella aid group venro in germany described the attack as a " really bad setback " for humanitarian work in afghanistan .
it was " already very difficult to recruit qualified personnel for aid missions in afghanistan , " post told german newspaper hannoversche allgemeine .
" now it will be even more difficult , " he said .
sam zarifi from the human rights organization amnesty international echoed the view .
" certainly , this is one of the worst attacks ever on aid workers in afghanistan .
keep in mind that at least for the last three decades , it has been basically aid workers who have serviced the afghan people 's basic needs - not the afghan government or foreign governments , " zarifi said in an interview with the bbc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international assistance mission has denied trying to convert muslims to christianity groups denies it tried to convert people the taliban claimed responsibility for the killings , accusing the victims of being spies and christian missionaries .
they said the charity had been seeking to convert muslims to christianity , a charge which dirk frans , executive director of iam , has strongly denied .
" the accusation is completely baseless .
they were not carrying any bibles except maybe their personal bibles , " frans told news agency reuters .

one of the victims was a 35-year-old german woman . the german government has condemned last week 's killing of a group of medical workers in northern afghanistan .
the bullet-ridden bodies of six americans , a german woman , a briton and two afghans were found in a remote area of the northeastern province of badakhshan on friday .
the bodies have since been flown to the afghan capital kabul for formal identification .
authorities in berlin have given more details about the german victim of the attack .
the 35-year-old woman from chemnitz , in the eastern state of saxony , has been identified as translator daniela b ..
the us embassy in kabul said on sunday that six of the slain aid workers in northern afghanistan were identified by a forensic investigation as us nationals .
us secretary of state hillary clinton has condemned the killings as a " senseless act " against " heroic , generous people . "
the victims were part of a 12-member medical team working for a christian charity called the international assistance mission -lrb- iam -rrb- .
they were mainly involved in providing eye care in remote regions .
' bad setback ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : trittin said the attack showed the volatility of the situation in afghanistan politicians in germany have been quick to condemn the attack .
the government called for a " thorough clarification of such a cowardly murder . "
juergen trittin , the head of the parliamentary faction of germany 's opposition green party , echoed the anger of his political rivals .
" it 's shocking that even people who clearly have nothing to do with the military , doctors who were helping people , have become the target of such an attack .
that shows how unstable the situation is in afghanistan today , " he said .
ulrich post , head of the umbrella aid group venro in germany described the attack as a " really bad setback " for humanitarian work in afghanistan .
it was " already very difficult to recruit qualified personnel for aid missions in afghanistan , " post told german newspaper hannoversche allgemeine .
" now it will be even more difficult , " he said .
sam zarifi from the human rights organization amnesty international echoed the view .
" certainly , this is one of the worst attacks ever on aid workers in afghanistan .
keep in mind that at least for the last three decades , it has been basically aid workers who have serviced the afghan people 's basic needs - not the afghan government or foreign governments , " zarifi said in an interview with the bbc .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international assistance mission has denied trying to convert muslims to christianity groups denies it tried to convert people the taliban claimed responsibility for the killings , accusing the victims of being spies and christian missionaries .
they said the charity had been seeking to convert muslims to christianity , a charge which dirk frans , executive director of iam , has strongly denied .
" the accusation is completely baseless .
they were not carrying any bibles except maybe their personal bibles , " frans told news agency reuters .
" as an organization we are not involved in proselytizing at all .
" i like people who stand for a cause , but i think you really need to reflect on what you 're communicating to people - and this would be my suggestion to the taliban .
think about what you 're doing .
is this the best way of serving god ? " he said .
abdullah abdullah , a senior afghan politician and former presidential candidate who trained as an eye surgeon with one of the medical workers , also dismissed the taliban 's claims as " ridiculous . "
police investigating driver the driver of the convoy in which the medical workers were traveling was arrested on sunday .
police said he was being questioned as part of investigations into the killings .
violence in afghanistan is at its worst since the us-led forces overthrew the taliban in 2001 .
june was the deadliest month of the war for foreign forces , with over 100 killed .
deaths of civilians have also risen dramatically , according to the afghan independent human rights commission -lrb- aihrc -rrb- .
they said 1,325 civilians died in the first seven months of 2010 .

critics of the government say the country may be stable but has moved far away from being a real democracy . rwandans went to the ballot box on monday to vote for a new president , although no one was biting their nails over the outcome - the country 's sitting president , paul kagame , was expected to win with some 90 percent of the vote .
critics say despite its democratic appearance , the election represents just another seven-year extension of kagame 's iron-fisted rule during which rwanda 's economy has flourished , but any political opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed , turning the east african nation into what amounts to a one-party state .
" after the genocide there was the appearance to a certain extent of a liberal system , but for many years one can clearly see that it 's a de facto one-party state , " denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" there are a few political parties allowed , but those represented in parliament ca n't be considered a real opposition , " he said .
monday 's vote is the second presidential election since the country was rocked with genocidal violence in 1994 that killed some 800,000 .
while the country has not seen a repeat of that horror , this election run-up has been marked by a spate of arrests , mysterious killings and restrictions on the free-speech rights of critical opposition figures that could well affect the nation 's long-term stability , and reopen the wounds left over from the genocide .
growth and stability kagame 's supporters , including many in the west , can point to a string of accomplishments during his 16 years at the top - 10 as president - beginning in those dark days in 1994 , when he helped end the wave of killing that had wracked the country .
after the genocide , the country was in ruins , today rwanda is the safest , cleanest country in africa , with no slums and almost no begging or street crime .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government often touts its successful efforts to improve the status of rwandan women his ruling rwandan patriotic front party has overseen a trebling of household incomes and today citizens have access to universal health insurance and the country 's parliament has a higher percentage of female members than anywhere else in the world - 56 percent .
" i will continue to work as hard as i can till the day we can speak of a rwanda that has achieved the kind of prosperity that leaves no one behind and everyone proud of who they are , " kagame wrote in a letter to supporters posted on his website friday .
the other side of the coin but there is a dark side to kagame 's rule , critics say , charging that all the stability has came at a high price - human rights .
over the last few months , a string of attacks on rwandans with whom the president has fallen out has raised eyebrows and suspicions .

he said he himself was threatened by unnamed men in february who he suspects of being government security operatives .
" we know kagame 's party is going to win this election , because the president is very prepared and he has no competition at all , " he added .
" this election is an election where there is no opposition . "
kagame won a 2003 presidential election with 95 percent of the vote .

it also helps that kagame , 52 , is an elegant , charismatic figure , who speaks well and knows how to court international players .
over the past few weeks , kagame has responded to allegations about democratic deficits by saying democracy in rwanda takes time to establish , stability is the priority , especially given the convulsion of 1994 .
" your model of democracy , why should it be suitable for me , " he told britain 's guardian newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kagame has used his role in ending the 1994 genocide to his advantage foreign governments and advisors have been mostly quiet about the rights situation , despite the fact that rwanda is ranked 183 out of 195 countries for freedom of the press .
according to analyst tull , that is partly due to the fact that kagame , the rebel army leader who stopped the genocide , has successfully played on western guilt about its non-intervention during the killing .
" the government is saying , we have other goals , like stability and development , and we wo n't be told by others how to lead our country , especially by an international community which did n't intervene to stop the genocide , " he said .
" that is the message and it 's getting across fairly well because we have n't seen that much criticism from outside . "

critics of the government say the country may be stable but has moved far away from being a real democracy . rwandans went to the ballot box on monday to vote for a new president , although no one was biting their nails over the outcome - the country 's sitting president , paul kagame , was expected to win with some 90 percent of the vote .
critics say despite its democratic appearance , the election represents just another seven-year extension of kagame 's iron-fisted rule during which rwanda 's economy has flourished , but any political opposition has been ruthlessly suppressed , turning the east african nation into what amounts to a one-party state .
" after the genocide there was the appearance to a certain extent of a liberal system , but for many years one can clearly see that it 's a de facto one-party state , " denis tull , an africa expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle .
" there are a few political parties allowed , but those represented in parliament ca n't be considered a real opposition , " he said .
monday 's vote is the second presidential election since the country was rocked with genocidal violence in 1994 that killed some 800,000 .
while the country has not seen a repeat of that horror , this election run-up has been marked by a spate of arrests , mysterious killings and restrictions on the free-speech rights of critical opposition figures that could well affect the nation 's long-term stability , and reopen the wounds left over from the genocide .
growth and stability kagame 's supporters , including many in the west , can point to a string of accomplishments during his 16 years at the top - 10 as president - beginning in those dark days in 1994 , when he helped end the wave of killing that had wracked the country .
after the genocide , the country was in ruins , today rwanda is the safest , cleanest country in africa , with no slums and almost no begging or street crime .
its economy is expected to grow 6 percent this year and tax revenues to increase by 12 percent .
kagame has positioned himself as a foe of corruption which has attracted donors and private investors , including big names like starbucks and the gulf investment firm dubai world .
berlin-based corruption watchdog transparency international ranks rwanda as the least corrupt country in east africa .
the world bank puts the country among the top five most attractive african nations to do business .
kagame 's popularity with foreign donors has meant the country 's food stocks are swelling , the chinese have built a basic road network and south korea is laying a fiber-optic system across the country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government often touts its successful efforts to improve the status of rwandan women his ruling rwandan patriotic front party has overseen a trebling of household incomes and today citizens have access to universal health insurance and the country 's parliament has a higher percentage of female members than anywhere else in the world - 56 percent .
" i will continue to work as hard as i can till the day we can speak of a rwanda that has achieved the kind of prosperity that leaves no one behind and everyone proud of who they are , " kagame wrote in a letter to supporters posted on his website friday .
the other side of the coin but there is a dark side to kagame 's rule , critics say , charging that all the stability has came at a high price - human rights .
over the last few months , a string of attacks on rwandans with whom the president has fallen out has raised eyebrows and suspicions .
opposition politicians and independent journalists have been harassed , arrested , or worse .
police have arrested two aspiring presidential candidates and opposition supporters have been detained for holding an illegal rally .
victoire ingabire , a hutu politician who had hoped to stand against kagame , must face charges of " denying the genocide " while in exile .
general faustin kayumba nyamwasa , a critic kagame , fled his homeland in february and was shot in the stomach in june in south africa .
the deputy editor of a critical newspaper was recently shot and killed outside his home in the capital kigali .
andre kagwa rwisereka , the deputy leader of the opposition democratic green party of rwanda , was found nearly decapitated in the south of the country .
" we have stability here and you can see economic improvement .
but we do n't think it 's sustainable , because we say stability and democracy must go hand and hand , " frank habineza , president of rwanda 's green party , told deutsche welle by telephone from kigali .
he said he himself was threatened by unnamed men in february who he suspects of being government security operatives .
" we know kagame 's party is going to win this election , because the president is very prepared and he has no competition at all , " he added .
" this election is an election where there is no opposition . "
kagame won a 2003 presidential election with 95 percent of the vote .
this time around , he faces three opponents who backed him seven years ago .

kagame 's list of advisors includes tony blair , bill clinton , high-profile us evangelist rick warren and the ceos of google and starbucks .
it also helps that kagame , 52 , is an elegant , charismatic figure , who speaks well and knows how to court international players .
over the past few weeks , kagame has responded to allegations about democratic deficits by saying democracy in rwanda takes time to establish , stability is the priority , especially given the convulsion of 1994 .
" your model of democracy , why should it be suitable for me , " he told britain 's guardian newspaper .

one of the victims was a 35-year-old german woman . the german government has condemned last week 's killing of a group of medical workers in northern afghanistan .
the bullet-ridden bodies of six americans , a german woman , a briton and two afghans were found in a remote area of the northeastern province of badakhshan on friday .
the bodies have since been flown to the afghan capital kabul for formal identification .
authorities in berlin have given more details about the german victim of the attack .

they were not carrying any bibles except maybe their personal bibles , " frans told news agency reuters .
