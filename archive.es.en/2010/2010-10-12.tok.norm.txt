students in paris chanted slogans , waved banners and climbed up on the roofs of bus shelters with loudspeakers .

" it 's hard enough to find a steady job and if this goes through it will be even harder , " she added .
sarkozy pledges to persevere sarkozy 's pension plan is quickly becoming one of the biggest battles of his presidency , pitting him against unions that crushed a previous attempt to reform the system in 1995 .
his administration , however , is refusing to buckle under the pressure . " we have reached the limit of the -lrb- concessions -rrb- that are possible , " prime minister francois fillon said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.10.2010 germany 's khedira has gone from backup to bulwark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was germany 's heart and soul against turkey as a defensive stopper , sami khedira does n't post the sort of numbers that leap out at you from score sheets .
but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

many of those charities are funded by oil-rich saudi arabia and propagate wahhabism - the kingdom 's austere and puritan interpretation of islam .
a majority of wahhabis favor peaceful proselytizing of islam while saudi king abdullah has been seeking to soften wahhabi practices as part of his reforms in the kingdom .
militant groups such as osama bin laden 's al-qaeda , the taliban and jihadists in somalia have however embraced significant elements of wahhabism as part of their ideology .
jasmin merdan , a young bosnian who wrote a book after disassociating himself from wahhabis groups in bosnia , warned that " they express their convictions with violence , introduce anarchy in mosques and preach intolerance . " women in the albanian city of skadar have reportedly started covering their heads or wearing the niqab , a full body covering that hides everything but the eyes , in newly found religiosity .
the video posted on youtube is one of several produced by home grown jihadists in the balkans and circulating in the region .
" oh osama , annihilate the american army .
oh osama , raise the muslims ’ honor , " a group of macedonian men chant in albanian on the video .
" in september 2001 you conquered a power .

similar songs calling on southeastern european muslims to join the jihad have been produced in bosnian .
governments and security forces fear that that increased wahhabi activity will produce committed jihadis that could destabilize already fragile nations in southeastern europe and , in the case of bulgaria - where one sixth of the country 's 7.6 million people is muslim - produce a pool of jihadists whose eu passports would grant them easy access to western europe and allow them to blend into society . bulgaria seen as potential breeding ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most bulgarian muslims are of turkish ethnicity bulgaria is the only eu member whose muslim population are not recent immigrants .
most bulgarian muslims like those elsewhere in the balkans are descendants of ethnic turks who arrived during five centuries of ottoman rule .
three ethnic albanian brothers from macedonia were convicted to life in prison in 2008 on charges of plotting to attack the us army 's fort dix military base in new jersey .
a fourth member of the group from kosovo was sentenced to five years in jail .
across the balkans , minority wahhabi groups seek to convert mainstream islam to their more militant interpretation through the operation of cultural centers , mosques , schools and at times by battling for control of majority muslim organizations and community-owned property .
a majority of the region 's muslims are secular and analysts caution against overstating the wahhabi threat .
" it should not be ignored , but neither should it be exaggerated , " said hajrudin somun a former bosnian ambassador to turkey and history professor at sarajevo 's philip noel-baker international university .
the analysts say militant islam is gaining ground on the fringe of a more general return to religion in the balkans .
several thousand orthodox christian bulgarians demonstrated in sofia recently demanding that religious instruction be made compulsory in schools - a demand supported by mainstream muslim organizations .
muslim organizations are believed to have spent large amounts of money over the last decade to build some 150 new mosques and educational centers in predominantly orthodox bulgaria .
a minority are believed to promote wahhabism .
analysts say that radical islam has gained ground in southern and northeastern bulgaria where militant islamists , according to former bulgarian chief mufti nedim gendzhev , are seeking to create a " fundamentalist triangle " in areas of bosnia , macedonia and bulgaria 's western rhodope mountains .
fears of increasing radicalism bulgarian authorities last year arrested a mayor and a village teacher in the south of the country on charges of preaching radical islam .
in 2003 , authorities shut down several islamic centers because they were financed by saudi-funded muslim groups believed to have links to militant islamic organizations and " to prevent terrorists getting a foothold in bulgaria . "
some analysts estimate that 3,000 young muslims have graduated from militant schools still operating in bulgaria ; it was not immediately clear what they went on to do following their graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations are tense between muslims and serbs in bosnia the threat posed by the wahhabis is a major bone of contention in tense relations between muslims and serbs in bosnia , which so far has successfully neutralized wahhabi influence by controlling the appointment of imams in mosques and teachers at islamic educational institutions and employing law enforcement .
some bosnian wahhabis , estimated to number 3,000 , are former foreign fighters who married bosnian women and stayed in the country after the bosnian war that ended in 1995 .
bosnia recently stepped up its fight against militancy and organized crime to meet an eu requirement for visa-free travel for bosnians and closer ties with the bloc .
in early september , bosnian police uncovered a cache of weapons and detained a third suspect as part of their inquiry into a june bomb attack that killed one policeman and injured six others .
the attack on a police station in the town of bugojno was one of the most serious security incidents in bosnia .
police arrested the suspected mastermind and an aide shortly after the blast .
bosnia tries to crackdown on militants boris grubesic , a spokesman for the bosnian prosecutor 's office , told reporters in mid-september that prosecutors were investigating several people from bugojno and gornja maoca on suspicion of wahhabi ties , terrorism and human trafficking .
in february , bosnian and eu police raided gornja maoca and arrested seven men described as wahhabis because of their beards and shortened trousers .
police said they were detained for suspected illegal possession of arms and threatening the country 's " territorial integrity , constitutional order and provoking inter-ethnic and religious hatred . " gornja maoca was home to some 30 families who lived by strict shariah laws , organized schooling in arabic for their children outside the state system and opposed the primacy of bosnia 's mainstream islamic community .
nusret imamovic , the town 's self-proclaimed wahhabi leader , endorsed suicide attacks on the group 's bosnian language website , saying they should be launched only in " exceptional circumstances . "
the site features statements by al-qaeda and islamic groups fighting in the caucasus and celebrates suicide bombers as joyful muslims .
serbian officials say 12 alleged wahhabis convicted last year to prison terms of up to 13 years for planning terrorist attacks , including on the us embassy in belgrade , had close ties to their brethren in gornja maoca .
one of the convicted , adnan hot , said during the trial that imamovic was one of only three muslim leaders that he followed .
four other wahhabis were sentenced in a separate case to jail terms of up to eight years on charges of planning to bomb a football stadium in the southern serbian town of novi pazar .
in macedonia , suleyman rexhepim rexhepi , head of the official islamic religious community -lrb- ivz -rrb- , recently called on the government and the international community to crack down on increasingly influential wahabbi groups .
rexhepi is locked into a bitter battle with ramadan ramadani , the imam of the isa beg mosque in skopje , that has caused a rift in the country 's muslim community .
ramadani accuses rexhep of financial msmangement and is seeking his ouster .
he organized a petition signed by thousands of his followers supporting his bid for leadership of the community after rexhepi banned him from organizing prayers .
ramadani denies that wahhabis are active among macedonian muslims who account for roughly one quarter of the population as well as allegations that the pro-bin laden music video was played in mosques he controls .
a ramadani associate , radical kosovo imam sefket krasnici , shocked macedonians , when he recently denounced mother teresa , a native of skopje whom many consider a saint , during a sermon in the macedonian capital .
" she belongs in the middle of hell because she did not believe in allah , the prophet and the koran ...
even if she believed in god her belief was incomplete , with deficiencies .
god does not accept such worship , " krasnici said .

four other wahhabis were sentenced in a separate case to jail terms of up to eight years on charges of planning to bomb a football stadium in the southern serbian town of novi pazar .
in macedonia , suleyman rexhepim rexhepi , head of the official islamic religious community -lrb- ivz -rrb- , recently called on the government and the international community to crack down on increasingly influential wahabbi groups .
rexhepi is locked into a bitter battle with ramadan ramadani , the imam of the isa beg mosque in skopje , that has caused a rift in the country 's muslim community .
ramadani accuses rexhep of financial msmangement and is seeking his ouster .
he organized a petition signed by thousands of his followers supporting his bid for leadership of the community after rexhepi banned him from organizing prayers .
ramadani denies that wahhabis are active among macedonian muslims who account for roughly one quarter of the population as well as allegations that the pro-bin laden music video was played in mosques he controls .
a ramadani associate , radical kosovo imam sefket krasnici , shocked macedonians , when he recently denounced mother teresa , a native of skopje whom many consider a saint , during a sermon in the macedonian capital .
" she belongs in the middle of hell because she did not believe in allah , the prophet and the koran ...
even if she believed in god her belief was incomplete , with deficiencies .
god does not accept such worship , " krasnici said .

many of those charities are funded by oil-rich saudi arabia and propagate wahhabism - the kingdom 's austere and puritan interpretation of islam .
a majority of wahhabis favor peaceful proselytizing of islam while saudi king abdullah has been seeking to soften wahhabi practices as part of his reforms in the kingdom .
militant groups such as osama bin laden 's al-qaeda , the taliban and jihadists in somalia have however embraced significant elements of wahhabism as part of their ideology .
jasmin merdan , a young bosnian who wrote a book after disassociating himself from wahhabis groups in bosnia , warned that " they express their convictions with violence , introduce anarchy in mosques and preach intolerance . " women in the albanian city of skadar have reportedly started covering their heads or wearing the niqab , a full body covering that hides everything but the eyes , in newly found religiosity .
the video posted on youtube is one of several produced by home grown jihadists in the balkans and circulating in the region .
" oh osama , annihilate the american army .
oh osama , raise the muslims ’ honor , " a group of macedonian men chant in albanian on the video .
" in september 2001 you conquered a power .
we all pray for you . "
similar songs calling on southeastern european muslims to join the jihad have been produced in bosnian .
governments and security forces fear that that increased wahhabi activity will produce committed jihadis that could destabilize already fragile nations in southeastern europe and , in the case of bulgaria - where one sixth of the country 's 7.6 million people is muslim - produce a pool of jihadists whose eu passports would grant them easy access to western europe and allow them to blend into society . bulgaria seen as potential breeding ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most bulgarian muslims are of turkish ethnicity bulgaria is the only eu member whose muslim population are not recent immigrants .
most bulgarian muslims like those elsewhere in the balkans are descendants of ethnic turks who arrived during five centuries of ottoman rule .
three ethnic albanian brothers from macedonia were convicted to life in prison in 2008 on charges of plotting to attack the us army 's fort dix military base in new jersey .
a fourth member of the group from kosovo was sentenced to five years in jail .
across the balkans , minority wahhabi groups seek to convert mainstream islam to their more militant interpretation through the operation of cultural centers , mosques , schools and at times by battling for control of majority muslim organizations and community-owned property .
a majority of the region 's muslims are secular and analysts caution against overstating the wahhabi threat .
" it should not be ignored , but neither should it be exaggerated , " said hajrudin somun a former bosnian ambassador to turkey and history professor at sarajevo 's philip noel-baker international university .
the analysts say militant islam is gaining ground on the fringe of a more general return to religion in the balkans .
several thousand orthodox christian bulgarians demonstrated in sofia recently demanding that religious instruction be made compulsory in schools - a demand supported by mainstream muslim organizations .
muslim organizations are believed to have spent large amounts of money over the last decade to build some 150 new mosques and educational centers in predominantly orthodox bulgaria .
a minority are believed to promote wahhabism .
analysts say that radical islam has gained ground in southern and northeastern bulgaria where militant islamists , according to former bulgarian chief mufti nedim gendzhev , are seeking to create a " fundamentalist triangle " in areas of bosnia , macedonia and bulgaria 's western rhodope mountains .
fears of increasing radicalism bulgarian authorities last year arrested a mayor and a village teacher in the south of the country on charges of preaching radical islam .
in 2003 , authorities shut down several islamic centers because they were financed by saudi-funded muslim groups believed to have links to militant islamic organizations and " to prevent terrorists getting a foothold in bulgaria . "
some analysts estimate that 3,000 young muslims have graduated from militant schools still operating in bulgaria ; it was not immediately clear what they went on to do following their graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations are tense between muslims and serbs in bosnia the threat posed by the wahhabis is a major bone of contention in tense relations between muslims and serbs in bosnia , which so far has successfully neutralized wahhabi influence by controlling the appointment of imams in mosques and teachers at islamic educational institutions and employing law enforcement .
some bosnian wahhabis , estimated to number 3,000 , are former foreign fighters who married bosnian women and stayed in the country after the bosnian war that ended in 1995 .
bosnia recently stepped up its fight against militancy and organized crime to meet an eu requirement for visa-free travel for bosnians and closer ties with the bloc .
in early september , bosnian police uncovered a cache of weapons and detained a third suspect as part of their inquiry into a june bomb attack that killed one policeman and injured six others .
the attack on a police station in the town of bugojno was one of the most serious security incidents in bosnia .
police arrested the suspected mastermind and an aide shortly after the blast .
bosnia tries to crackdown on militants boris grubesic , a spokesman for the bosnian prosecutor 's office , told reporters in mid-september that prosecutors were investigating several people from bugojno and gornja maoca on suspicion of wahhabi ties , terrorism and human trafficking .
in february , bosnian and eu police raided gornja maoca and arrested seven men described as wahhabis because of their beards and shortened trousers .
police said they were detained for suspected illegal possession of arms and threatening the country 's " territorial integrity , constitutional order and provoking inter-ethnic and religious hatred . " gornja maoca was home to some 30 families who lived by strict shariah laws , organized schooling in arabic for their children outside the state system and opposed the primacy of bosnia 's mainstream islamic community .
nusret imamovic , the town 's self-proclaimed wahhabi leader , endorsed suicide attacks on the group 's bosnian language website , saying they should be launched only in " exceptional circumstances . "
the site features statements by al-qaeda and islamic groups fighting in the caucasus and celebrates suicide bombers as joyful muslims .
serbian officials say 12 alleged wahhabis convicted last year to prison terms of up to 13 years for planning terrorist attacks , including on the us embassy in belgrade , had close ties to their brethren in gornja maoca .

europe 's social affairs commissioner said financial help is available to member states . the european commission will once again push member states to do more to improve the situation for roma travelers on tuesday at a conference in bucharest .
the meeting was organized after the french government began its deportations of roma families over the summer , drawing international criticism .
the bucharest conference aims to promote the better use of eu funds to improve the socio-economic situation of the 10 to 12 million roma living on the continent .
they face discrimination , poverty , segregation , and barriers to education and the labor market in many of the european countries in which they settle .
in slovakia , for example , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education .
in bulgaria , over 50 percent of roma are unemployed .
in romania only about a quarter of roma have a steady job .
european funds are under-used in recent years the european union has brought in a comprehensive financial program to promote the integration of the roma and sinti travelers .
but romania and bulgaria , the eu member states with the biggest roma communities , have made little use of the subsidies .
despite the high-profile debate about integration of roma sparked by france 's crackdown on its traveling community , the european union 's commissioner for social affairs and inclusion complained recently that few nations are drawing on the available financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laszlo andor wants countries to make better use of european funds " i would like to stress that this is the responsibility of the european union and the member states together , " andor said in the european parliament .
" the structural funds offer a very useful financial lever for supporting national efforts to improve the situation of the roma .
however , eu funds are often not fully used , or not used in the most effective way . "
currently romania is only using 1 percent of the 2.25 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- made available by the european social fund between 2007 and 2013 to improve the situation of vulnerable groups .
bulgaria is only using 5 percent of the fund .
integration is not just about money however , there is of course no compulsion to use the money .
the german conservative mep manfred weber hopes there is enough incentive for countries to apply for the money if they need it .
" the decisive factor in integration of course is always that it ca n't be proscribed from above , rather it 's got to happen in the towns , in the communities themselves , " weber told deutsche welle .
" it demands creativity . "
the european commission has set up a working group to assess why the roma struggle so much with integration .
the group will deliver its findings by the end of the year .
in the meantime andor wants member states to set ambitious targets for tackling poverty and improving the educational horizons of the roma .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in slovakia , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education " it 's only about poverty reduction , it 's not only about social inclusion , " the commissioner said .
" we have to ensure that the roma are explicitly mentioned in our new employment flagship initiative , because that 's also where a breakthrough has to be made . "
manfred weber believes governments have to tackle the root of the problem by targeting education .
“ we have to follow through the idea that children of this ethnic minority must attend school .
only then can we succeed in truly integrating these travelling families into european societies . ”
the problems for the roma in europe are not new .
there is money available in europe to tackle it .
but it has taken the row over the policy of deporting roma from france to bring this much-beleaguered community into the spotlight .

but not all germans are happy that their homes , cars and even themselves could be online for all to see . some 1 million germans make use of the street view service daily for a virtual ground 's eye look of the world , according to google .
but the company has been heavily criticized in germany as it gets ready to put maps of german cities online , which the company plans to do by the end of the year .
much of that criticism has come from the southern german state of bavaria , and the region around the city of ingolstadt in particular .
" the problem with google street view is that google - without asking - has gone and photographed german houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used , " georg schaeff , the publisher of the ingolstadt-based daily donaukurier , told deutsche welle .
the newspaper has publicized local opposition to the service for the last two years .
that 's a problem in germany since the country 's highest court has affirmed citizens ' rights to control who has their personal information and how it 's used .
google gives ground " we take privacy very seriously , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service . "
the california tech giant has made concessions to german privacy advocates by allowing material to be made unrecognizable before being published , which it has n't done in the other 23 countries street view is online .
furthermore , after facing widespread criticism , it doubled the opt-out period to eight weeks , which ends on friday .
some 200,000 people have taken google up on the offer to have their homes or apartment building blurred , according to a report in the german news magazine der spiegel .
google , which automatically blurs the faces and vehicle license plates its computer can recognize and asks users to point out the ones it misses , has not commented on the number of opt-out it has received .
bildunterschrift : some 200,000 people have removed themselves from street view , a german magazine reported but schaeff said people have no way of making sure what they see as a violation of their privacy really gets deleted .
he added that citizens have little recourse if google does n't agree with their claim of a privacy infringement by the panoramic photos of whatever is visible from the street taken by the eight cameras mounted on the company 's car .
" individual citizens ca n't assert themselves against these kinds of companies , " he said .
" and the corporations do n't bother to consider if what they are doing is illegal or not .
google works on the premise of ' why ask for permission when you can beg for forgiveness after the fact ? " '
privacy rift but privacy advocates still have a lot of convincing to do .
some 41 percent of germans see more positive than negative aspects to street view and 16 percent say they have or will remove their homes from the service , according to an august study by the emnid research institute .
many ingolstadt locals agreed with the poll 's sentiment .
" google can go ahead and do it , because everyone leaves their tracks all over the internet and everywhere else , " said ingo zingel , an ingolstadt resident .
" whether someone takes a picture of the door to my house really does n't matter . "
schaeff said he 's not surprised that some people do n't seem concerned about what 's happening to their personal information .
" i think there is a rift in society where half the people do n't see a problem and do n't know what 's coming down the road , " he said .
" the other half is much more sensitive and is more careful because the situation is far from clear . "
what 's unclear , he added , is how images from street view - or any other type of geodata , such as that collected by mobile phone providers - can be used to create profiles of individuals that are later sold to third parties .
without knowing how personal data will be used , he said people should give out as little as possible .
" each piece of personal information is like a stone that creates a mosaic , " schaeff said .
" every little stone plays a meaningful role , but , unfortunately , you ca n't tell what the role is until the whole picture has been made . "
' sensible areas ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 41 percent germans said street view has more positive than negative aspects but there are some pictures thomas herker , the mayor of pfaffenhofen , just south of ingolstadt , said he knows he does n't want made .
while he insisted that city hall and pubic offices be visible in street view , he added that some public buildings should be unrecognizable on the internet .
" we requested that google remove public kindergartens and schools , " he said referring to a letter the city sent in december 2009 to google 's german headquarters in hamburg .
" two weeks ago we were told they would not do it because only private individuals - not municipalities - have a right to remove property . "
herker led a group of bavarian mayors which sent another request to google asking for the company to respect their wishes and remove kindergartens and other " sensible areas " from street view .
while herker is left hoping google accounts for his city 's wishes , the point may become moot if the service goes online as planned by the end of the year .
the last time herker wrote to google it took 10 months to get a form letter response .
if it takes that long again the pictures will have long been online for all to see .
" there are three companies in germany that , in my opinion , are problematic : deutsche telekom , deutsche bahn , and now i 've added google to the list , " he said .
" i can only hope that google will change its mind and make it possible to remove public property from the service . "

' sensible areas ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 41 percent germans said street view has more positive than negative aspects but there are some pictures thomas herker , the mayor of pfaffenhofen , just south of ingolstadt , said he knows he does n't want made .
while he insisted that city hall and pubic offices be visible in street view , he added that some public buildings should be unrecognizable on the internet .
" we requested that google remove public kindergartens and schools , " he said referring to a letter the city sent in december 2009 to google 's german headquarters in hamburg .
" two weeks ago we were told they would not do it because only private individuals - not municipalities - have a right to remove property . "
herker led a group of bavarian mayors which sent another request to google asking for the company to respect their wishes and remove kindergartens and other " sensible areas " from street view .
while herker is left hoping google accounts for his city 's wishes , the point may become moot if the service goes online as planned by the end of the year .
the last time herker wrote to google it took 10 months to get a form letter response .
if it takes that long again the pictures will have long been online for all to see .
" there are three companies in germany that , in my opinion , are problematic : deutsche telekom , deutsche bahn , and now i 've added google to the list , " he said .
" i can only hope that google will change its mind and make it possible to remove public property from the service . "

but not all germans are happy that their homes , cars and even themselves could be online for all to see . some 1 million germans make use of the street view service daily for a virtual ground 's eye look of the world , according to google .
but the company has been heavily criticized in germany as it gets ready to put maps of german cities online , which the company plans to do by the end of the year .
much of that criticism has come from the southern german state of bavaria , and the region around the city of ingolstadt in particular .
" the problem with google street view is that google - without asking - has gone and photographed german houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used , " georg schaeff , the publisher of the ingolstadt-based daily donaukurier , told deutsche welle .
the newspaper has publicized local opposition to the service for the last two years .
that 's a problem in germany since the country 's highest court has affirmed citizens ' rights to control who has their personal information and how it 's used .
google gives ground " we take privacy very seriously , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service . "
the california tech giant has made concessions to german privacy advocates by allowing material to be made unrecognizable before being published , which it has n't done in the other 23 countries street view is online .
furthermore , after facing widespread criticism , it doubled the opt-out period to eight weeks , which ends on friday .
some 200,000 people have taken google up on the offer to have their homes or apartment building blurred , according to a report in the german news magazine der spiegel .
google , which automatically blurs the faces and vehicle license plates its computer can recognize and asks users to point out the ones it misses , has not commented on the number of opt-out it has received .
bildunterschrift : some 200,000 people have removed themselves from street view , a german magazine reported but schaeff said people have no way of making sure what they see as a violation of their privacy really gets deleted .
he added that citizens have little recourse if google does n't agree with their claim of a privacy infringement by the panoramic photos of whatever is visible from the street taken by the eight cameras mounted on the company 's car .
" individual citizens ca n't assert themselves against these kinds of companies , " he said .
" and the corporations do n't bother to consider if what they are doing is illegal or not .
google works on the premise of ' why ask for permission when you can beg for forgiveness after the fact ? " '
privacy rift but privacy advocates still have a lot of convincing to do .
some 41 percent of germans see more positive than negative aspects to street view and 16 percent say they have or will remove their homes from the service , according to an august study by the emnid research institute .
many ingolstadt locals agreed with the poll 's sentiment .
" google can go ahead and do it , because everyone leaves their tracks all over the internet and everywhere else , " said ingo zingel , an ingolstadt resident .
" whether someone takes a picture of the door to my house really does n't matter . "
schaeff said he 's not surprised that some people do n't seem concerned about what 's happening to their personal information .
" i think there is a rift in society where half the people do n't see a problem and do n't know what 's coming down the road , " he said .
" the other half is much more sensitive and is more careful because the situation is far from clear . "
what 's unclear , he added , is how images from street view - or any other type of geodata , such as that collected by mobile phone providers - can be used to create profiles of individuals that are later sold to third parties .
without knowing how personal data will be used , he said people should give out as little as possible .
" each piece of personal information is like a stone that creates a mosaic , " schaeff said .
" every little stone plays a meaningful role , but , unfortunately , you ca n't tell what the role is until the whole picture has been made . "
' sensible areas ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 41 percent germans said street view has more positive than negative aspects but there are some pictures thomas herker , the mayor of pfaffenhofen , just south of ingolstadt , said he knows he does n't want made .

however , one city in the southern state of bavaria , oberstaufen , has publicly supported google street view - and may be the only city in the country that has supported the company to such a great degree .
in an interview with deutsche welle , bianca keybach , the head of oberstaufen 's tourist office , explained why the city even went so far as to bake for google .
deutsche welle : oberstaufen made a video and even baked a cake for google .
is that right ? bianca keybach : yes , we made a cake for google to welcome them and we put it into our facebook fan page and afterward we sent an invitation to google to say that we would be glad to welcome them here , and then google contacted us and we will see what happens .
when google contacted you , what happened ?
they were thankful for being so positive because this was a very big discussion in germany , -lsb- due to privacy -rsb- and taking pictures and everybody says we do n't want that .
we were one of the towns that said we would like -lsb- street view -rsb- .
tell me why you want google taking street view photographs in your town ?
what do you hope to accomplish other than to show how great the town is ?
i think that it would be an additional service for our guests .
when they are choosing a hotel or reading our brochures or they look at our homepage and they ca n't really say if everything is true , if there is a big street next to the hotel .
with google street view they can look into the town and discover the street , discover the region and after the holidays they can show their family and friends where they have been and what they can recommend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bianca keybach is the head of oberstaufen 's tourism office google has sent out their street view vehicles to big cities around germany , and they 're going to be releasing the photos for the 20 biggest cities around germany later this year .
have they actually sent a car to oberstaufen ?
they 've been here last year or at the beginning of this year .
they were in oberstaufen .
nobody saw them , though .
they took pictures and they have them and we 'll all waiting if there 's any chance that we can go on street view as soon as possible .
some have argued against street view because they say criminals could use it to plan robberies .
do you think that 's a valid argument ?
that 's a very interesting argument , because it 's one of the most important arguments for the critics but i think it 's crazy because the pictures were taken five or 10 months ago and they will be online for five or 10 years .
but if i want to get into a house and commit a crime , i wo n't use a picture that is many years old .
i could just use a postcard , for example , as a basis for burglary .
i think that 's not very realistic , but it 's very nice for a symbolic discussion .
are you surprised that there have n't been more cities that have welcomed google like oberstaufen has ?
i was not surprised because usually in germany you wait -lsb- to not draw attention to yourself -rsb- .
as long as you 're waiting , nobody is criticizing you .
i think it 's german , and it 's normal that no other towns really said , " we like google and we welcome google and we see a lot of positive aspects in this theme . "
after we said we like google and we support google street view , in our region , other towns and villages said , " we like would like to have them here , but you have to be the pioneer . "
we are glad that we decided to be very open .
now you mentioned earlier that you sent google a cake .
what kind of cake was it ?
i think it was a chocolate cake that was covered in frosting .
we just took a picture of the cake and sent the picture by e-mail , by twitter and we put it on facebook and we sent a real invitation that as soon as they come to take the other pictures of oberstaufen we will welcome them with the original cake .

do you think that 's a valid argument ?
that 's a very interesting argument , because it 's one of the most important arguments for the critics but i think it 's crazy because the pictures were taken five or 10 months ago and they will be online for five or 10 years .
but if i want to get into a house and commit a crime , i wo n't use a picture that is many years old .
i could just use a postcard , for example , as a basis for burglary .
i think that 's not very realistic , but it 's very nice for a symbolic discussion .
are you surprised that there have n't been more cities that have welcomed google like oberstaufen has ?
i was not surprised because usually in germany you wait -lsb- to not draw attention to yourself -rsb- .
as long as you 're waiting , nobody is criticizing you .
i think it 's german , and it 's normal that no other towns really said , " we like google and we welcome google and we see a lot of positive aspects in this theme . "
after we said we like google and we support google street view , in our region , other towns and villages said , " we like would like to have them here , but you have to be the pioneer . "
we are glad that we decided to be very open .
now you mentioned earlier that you sent google a cake .
what kind of cake was it ?
i think it was a chocolate cake that was covered in frosting .
we just took a picture of the cake and sent the picture by e-mail , by twitter and we put it on facebook and we sent a real invitation that as soon as they come to take the other pictures of oberstaufen we will welcome them with the original cake .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 12.10.2010 turkish eu affairs minister tells turkish germans to integrate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagis told turkish germans to accept german customs days after the leaders of germany and turkey pledged to cooperate more on the integration of germany 's substantial turkish minority , a turkish politician tells turkish germans integration is a responsibility . turkish european union affairs minister egemen bagis has called on turks in germany to better integrate themselves into german culture , inserting himself into a fierce and ongoing debate on the integration of germany 's turkish minority .
" learn german !
adjust to the customs of your host country , " he told daily newspaper bild in an interview published on tuesday .
" you do n't have to give up the gift of your identity and culture , but rather think of yourselves as ambassadors for turkey .
only then can you build bridges for a better friendship and partnership between our countries . "
three days before his comments were published , german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan met in berlin on the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between the two countries , pledging to cooperate more on integration of turks living in germany .
multi-faceted integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to work together on integration ines michalowski , a senior researcher at berlin 's social science research center , said the call for turkish-germans to maintain their culture while still adjusting to german customs may seem paradoxical , but that the two are not mutually exclusive .
" the turkish nation-state is a very nationalistic nation , where there are actually claims of turks belonging to the turkish nation-state even though they have been living abroad for several generations , " she told deutsche welle .
" but that does n't mean that integration on the labor market , or in the educational system , or contacts with germans - that these aspects of integration go badly . "
still , research shows that most turkish germans are poorly integrated in these areas - a fact which haci halil uslucan , director of the center for turkish studies and integration research , said can not be entirely attributed to a perceived lack of motivation of immigrants to integrate themselves .
" i think we also have to focus on the conditions of being integrated - and that means the attitudes of the majority , the look of the majority on the minority , " he told deutsche welle .
" the political discussion should not go in this direction of creating ranks - these are the good immigrants and these are the bad ones .
that only increases social tension . "
education is key bagis also said in his interview that turkish-german parents should send their children " to the best schools , so that they have a future , " echoing comments by prime minister erdogan that turkish-germans should prioritize education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research shows other minorities have integrated better than turks michalowski said studies of vietnamese immigrant parents in the eastern state of brandenburg have shown their children to have higher high-school graduation and college entrance rates than non-immigrant german children , partly because the parents place a high priority on education .
" some of the criticism has been that maybe turkish parents are not putting enough emphasis on getting a good education within germany , " she said .
" so if there is a government official from turkey who actually encourages people to pay more attention to the education of their children , i think that can never do any harm . "
but uslucan said other research shows that turkish-german parents have high educational aspirations for their children , and that teachers often send young turkish students to lower-level high schools that do not feed into universities , even when their educational performance is as good as their non-turkish peers .

" learn german !
adjust to the customs of your host country , " he told daily newspaper bild in an interview published on tuesday .
" you do n't have to give up the gift of your identity and culture , but rather think of yourselves as ambassadors for turkey .
only then can you build bridges for a better friendship and partnership between our countries . "
three days before his comments were published , german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan met in berlin on the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between the two countries , pledging to cooperate more on integration of turks living in germany .
multi-faceted integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to work together on integration ines michalowski , a senior researcher at berlin 's social science research center , said the call for turkish-germans to maintain their culture while still adjusting to german customs may seem paradoxical , but that the two are not mutually exclusive .
" the turkish nation-state is a very nationalistic nation , where there are actually claims of turks belonging to the turkish nation-state even though they have been living abroad for several generations , " she told deutsche welle .
" but that does n't mean that integration on the labor market , or in the educational system , or contacts with germans - that these aspects of integration go badly . "
still , research shows that most turkish germans are poorly integrated in these areas - a fact which haci halil uslucan , director of the center for turkish studies and integration research , said can not be entirely attributed to a perceived lack of motivation of immigrants to integrate themselves .
" i think we also have to focus on the conditions of being integrated - and that means the attitudes of the majority , the look of the majority on the minority , " he told deutsche welle .
" the political discussion should not go in this direction of creating ranks - these are the good immigrants and these are the bad ones .
that only increases social tension . "
education is key bagis also said in his interview that turkish-german parents should send their children " to the best schools , so that they have a future , " echoing comments by prime minister erdogan that turkish-germans should prioritize education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research shows other minorities have integrated better than turks michalowski said studies of vietnamese immigrant parents in the eastern state of brandenburg have shown their children to have higher high-school graduation and college entrance rates than non-immigrant german children , partly because the parents place a high priority on education .
" some of the criticism has been that maybe turkish parents are not putting enough emphasis on getting a good education within germany , " she said .
" so if there is a government official from turkey who actually encourages people to pay more attention to the education of their children , i think that can never do any harm . "
but uslucan said other research shows that turkish-german parents have high educational aspirations for their children , and that teachers often send young turkish students to lower-level high schools that do not feed into universities , even when their educational performance is as good as their non-turkish peers .

inefficient water use and pollution are among the major factors . while tourists are enjoying their vacation on the white beaches and at the well-maintained hotel pools , bali 's children are playing near polluted , stinking rivers .
there is hardly any sewage treatment in indonesia .
waste water from industry , agriculture and private homes mostly pours into the nearest stream or river , without any filtering .
health problems according to estimates by the world health organization , about 50,000 people die from illnesses related to polluted water in indonesia every year .
and there are approximately 120 million cases of diarrhoea , skin diseases and other illnesses caused by contaminated water annually .
yuyun ismawati , the director of the environmental group balifokus , says : " in some areas , people are getting used to using bad water , so they kind of build up their immune system and do not get sick very easily .
but in some areas , especially for visitors and tourists , it affects their stomach and they get diarrhoea and so on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yuyun ismawati receives the goldman environmental prize waterborne diseases not only affect people ’ s health , but also have an economic fallout .
this begins at the family level , yuyun ismawati emphasizes . " children are especially affected .
and in many cases when children get diarrhoea , that also affects their parents because they can not go to work .
and most of them rely on daily wages , so they will lose their income on that day .
or if the children who suffer from diarrhoea are of school age , they lose one day 's opportunity to go to school . "
tourists use more water in bali , the group maintains , the existing water resources are only enough to support a population of 2.7 million people .
by now , the island ’ s population has grown to 3.5 million .
and that does not include the more than 4 million tourists that visit bali every year .
most of them have no idea how much water they use every day .
" not very much .
i imagine it wouldn ’ t be more than 40 liters , " says one man .
" showers are very quick - 20 to 40 liters . "
another tourist guesses wildly : " about 10 liters : take a shower , drinking – oh , no , maybe it is up to 100 liters . "
bildunterschrift : hotels in bali use 500 liters of water per day and room in fact , it is 500 liters per day and hotel room in bali ’ s tourist areas , says the ngo balifokus , which specializes in water issues and wastewater management .
the figure for tourists is much higher than for the general population , taking into account not only the water for the showers , but also for the swimming pool and the watering of the hotel garden .
paradise lost yuyun ismawati from balifokus sees trouble ahead for the fabled ' island of the gods ' : " i think in the next 20 years , we might not be recognized as a paradise island any more because paradise should not be congested , paradise should not be stinky . "
in order to save the island , balifokus is currently developing projects for sewage treatment in cooperation with the bremen overseas research and development association , or borda , from the german city of bremen .
in 2009 , balifokus ' director yuyun ismawati was awarded the goldman environmental prize for grassroots environmental action .

inefficient water use and pollution are among the major factors . while tourists are enjoying their vacation on the white beaches and at the well-maintained hotel pools , bali 's children are playing near polluted , stinking rivers .
there is hardly any sewage treatment in indonesia .
waste water from industry , agriculture and private homes mostly pours into the nearest stream or river , without any filtering .
health problems according to estimates by the world health organization , about 50,000 people die from illnesses related to polluted water in indonesia every year .
and there are approximately 120 million cases of diarrhoea , skin diseases and other illnesses caused by contaminated water annually .
yuyun ismawati , the director of the environmental group balifokus , says : " in some areas , people are getting used to using bad water , so they kind of build up their immune system and do not get sick very easily .
but in some areas , especially for visitors and tourists , it affects their stomach and they get diarrhoea and so on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yuyun ismawati receives the goldman environmental prize waterborne diseases not only affect people ’ s health , but also have an economic fallout .
this begins at the family level , yuyun ismawati emphasizes . " children are especially affected .
and in many cases when children get diarrhoea , that also affects their parents because they can not go to work .
and most of them rely on daily wages , so they will lose their income on that day .
or if the children who suffer from diarrhoea are of school age , they lose one day 's opportunity to go to school . "
tourists use more water in bali , the group maintains , the existing water resources are only enough to support a population of 2.7 million people .
by now , the island ’ s population has grown to 3.5 million .
and that does not include the more than 4 million tourists that visit bali every year .
most of them have no idea how much water they use every day .
" not very much .
i imagine it wouldn ’ t be more than 40 liters , " says one man .
" showers are very quick - 20 to 40 liters . "
another tourist guesses wildly : " about 10 liters : take a shower , drinking – oh , no , maybe it is up to 100 liters . "
bildunterschrift : hotels in bali use 500 liters of water per day and room in fact , it is 500 liters per day and hotel room in bali ’ s tourist areas , says the ngo balifokus , which specializes in water issues and wastewater management .
the figure for tourists is much higher than for the general population , taking into account not only the water for the showers , but also for the swimming pool and the watering of the hotel garden .
paradise lost yuyun ismawati from balifokus sees trouble ahead for the fabled ' island of the gods ' : " i think in the next 20 years , we might not be recognized as a paradise island any more because paradise should not be congested , paradise should not be stinky . "
in order to save the island , balifokus is currently developing projects for sewage treatment in cooperation with the bremen overseas research and development association , or borda , from the german city of bremen .
in 2009 , balifokus ' director yuyun ismawati was awarded the goldman environmental prize for grassroots environmental action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 12.10.2010 german economics minister warns of ' trade war ' with china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle arrived in china on tuesday economics minister rainer bruederle began his two-day trip to china with warnings of a " trade war . "
he is hoping his visit will help promote “ sensible arrangements . ”
but observers are skeptical . economics minister rainer bruederle has framed his two-day trip to china , which began in beijing on tuesday , as a pacifying mission , following recent acrimony between china and many g-20 countries over trade .
" the danger of a trade war has appeared on the horizon , " bruederle told reporters traveling with him on his two-day trip to china , which is to include stops in beijing and shanghai .
the minister warned that accusations of currency manipulation should not be allowed to escalate , and protectionism must be avoided .
some of china 's trading partners in the us and europe have recently accused beijing of allowing the yuan to depreciate at a faster pace .
critics say the unit could be undervalued by as much as 40 percent .
ambassador and missionary speaking in beijing , bruederle refuted these claims , pointing out that the yuan had increased in value by 15 to 17 percent in the past two years , and he added that he did not expect the chinese government to adopt flexible trading patterns in the future .
" we must not allow the situation to get out of hand , or turn our backs on free trade , " bruederle said , adding that he saw himself as an " ambassador , perhaps even a missionary , for the fight against protectionism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has faced pressure from the eu over currency depreciation bruederle expressed satisfaction with the state of german-chinese trade , which has grown significantly this year .
german exports to china have grown by 52 percent to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of this year , while chinese exports have risen by 34 percent , compared to 2009 figures .
germany is considered one of china 's best friends in the west .
" the germans have been pushing for an open trade policy towards china , " jonathan holslag of the brussels institute of contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" germany 's economic revival after the financial crisis has been - to a large degree - made in china . "
" most of the expansion in germany 's exports – particularly cars and machinery – has been bound for china , " says holslag .
for this reason , holslag believes , the german government has often cautioned against protectionism towards china .
" angela merkel has also openly expressed her support for granting china market economy status , " holslag points out .
" this would make it more difficult for the european commission to apply anti-dumping procedures . "
good on the small-scale , not so much on the large-scale but despite germany 's huge economic interest in china – not only through exports , but also through direct investment from individual companies – bruederle 's leverage during this trip is likely to be limited .
the minister said that one of his main aims for the trip was to ensure that medium-sized german businesses gained better opportunities in china .
after his meetings with chinese commerce minister chen deming and zhang ping , the head of the country 's top economic planning agency , bruederle said he had been assured that german companies could take part in open competition in china provided they used a minimum of 50 percent local products .
but holslag believes this is a secondary priority for bruederle compared to maintaining export agreements .
" it 's important to distinguish degrees of urgency , " he says .
" the most important objective for the german government is to step up exports , and the second level is access to the chinese market .
germany is likely to be very cautious in negotiations , in order to protect exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery has been largely based on exports to china but despite this , there is concern that german companies are being disadvantaged by the chinese government .
rolf langhammer , vice-president of the kiel institute for the world economy , believes that this is where bruederle can at least make sure german businesses can get their voices heard .
" germany enjoys a very good position in china compared to other european countries , but of course there are barriers to mid-sized german companies , " he told deutsche welle .
" a lot of representatives of these firms are accompanying bruederle . "
langhammer does not think that bruederle can apply much pressure on the question of global exchange rates – the issue he addressed on arrival .
" the chinese government has always made clear that it wo n't let itself be influenced on this subject , and bruederle 's visit wo n't change anything in the discussion about the exchange rate . "
langhammer is also unconvinced by bruederle 's attempt to position himself as a mediator between the china and the west .
" that 's a role he can not play , " he says .
" he is much too small for that .
he does n't speak for the eurozone , he speaks for an export country called germany .
of course he can represent the interests of mid-sized companies , and he can voice their concerns if they feel themselves disadvantaged alongside chinese competition , but he ca n't solve the big questions – and he ca n't be a mediator in them . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 12.10.2010 german economics minister warns of ' trade war ' with china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle arrived in china on tuesday economics minister rainer bruederle began his two-day trip to china with warnings of a " trade war . "
he is hoping his visit will help promote “ sensible arrangements . ”
but observers are skeptical . economics minister rainer bruederle has framed his two-day trip to china , which began in beijing on tuesday , as a pacifying mission , following recent acrimony between china and many g-20 countries over trade .
" the danger of a trade war has appeared on the horizon , " bruederle told reporters traveling with him on his two-day trip to china , which is to include stops in beijing and shanghai .
the minister warned that accusations of currency manipulation should not be allowed to escalate , and protectionism must be avoided .
some of china 's trading partners in the us and europe have recently accused beijing of allowing the yuan to depreciate at a faster pace .
critics say the unit could be undervalued by as much as 40 percent .
ambassador and missionary speaking in beijing , bruederle refuted these claims , pointing out that the yuan had increased in value by 15 to 17 percent in the past two years , and he added that he did not expect the chinese government to adopt flexible trading patterns in the future .
" we must not allow the situation to get out of hand , or turn our backs on free trade , " bruederle said , adding that he saw himself as an " ambassador , perhaps even a missionary , for the fight against protectionism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has faced pressure from the eu over currency depreciation bruederle expressed satisfaction with the state of german-chinese trade , which has grown significantly this year .
german exports to china have grown by 52 percent to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of this year , while chinese exports have risen by 34 percent , compared to 2009 figures .
germany is considered one of china 's best friends in the west .
" the germans have been pushing for an open trade policy towards china , " jonathan holslag of the brussels institute of contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" germany 's economic revival after the financial crisis has been - to a large degree - made in china . "
" most of the expansion in germany 's exports – particularly cars and machinery – has been bound for china , " says holslag .
for this reason , holslag believes , the german government has often cautioned against protectionism towards china .
" angela merkel has also openly expressed her support for granting china market economy status , " holslag points out .
" this would make it more difficult for the european commission to apply anti-dumping procedures . "
good on the small-scale , not so much on the large-scale but despite germany 's huge economic interest in china – not only through exports , but also through direct investment from individual companies – bruederle 's leverage during this trip is likely to be limited .
the minister said that one of his main aims for the trip was to ensure that medium-sized german businesses gained better opportunities in china .
after his meetings with chinese commerce minister chen deming and zhang ping , the head of the country 's top economic planning agency , bruederle said he had been assured that german companies could take part in open competition in china provided they used a minimum of 50 percent local products .
but holslag believes this is a secondary priority for bruederle compared to maintaining export agreements .
" it 's important to distinguish degrees of urgency , " he says .
" the most important objective for the german government is to step up exports , and the second level is access to the chinese market .
germany is likely to be very cautious in negotiations , in order to protect exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery has been largely based on exports to china but despite this , there is concern that german companies are being disadvantaged by the chinese government .
rolf langhammer , vice-president of the kiel institute for the world economy , believes that this is where bruederle can at least make sure german businesses can get their voices heard .
" germany enjoys a very good position in china compared to other european countries , but of course there are barriers to mid-sized german companies , " he told deutsche welle .
" a lot of representatives of these firms are accompanying bruederle . "
langhammer does not think that bruederle can apply much pressure on the question of global exchange rates – the issue he addressed on arrival .
" the chinese government has always made clear that it wo n't let itself be influenced on this subject , and bruederle 's visit wo n't change anything in the discussion about the exchange rate . "
langhammer is also unconvinced by bruederle 's attempt to position himself as a mediator between the china and the west .
" that 's a role he can not play , " he says .
" he is much too small for that .
he does n't speak for the eurozone , he speaks for an export country called germany .
of course he can represent the interests of mid-sized companies , and he can voice their concerns if they feel themselves disadvantaged alongside chinese competition , but he ca n't solve the big questions – and he ca n't be a mediator in them . "

the kazakhs held die mannschaft for the first 45 minutes of the encounter , but were unable to stem the germans ’ flow of attacking football in the second half .
the first goal came from miroslav klose , who , finding the net for the third time in two games , slotted home three minutes after the break .
substitute mario gomez added a second goal in the 78th minute and lukas podolski put the final touch on the score line five minutes from fulltime .
the victory puts germany at the top of their group on 12 points , five clear of their nearest rival austria , who played out a thrilling 4-4 draw with belgium in tuesday 's late game .
the loss leaves kazakhstan bottom of the group with zero points .
germany coach joachim loew said that he was pleased with the result : " we achieved what we wanted to do , but obviously some errors occurred . "
" we have 12 points .
that is what we wanted , so i have to be satisfied .
what the team managed to achieve this year has been great , i ca n't expect them to be brilliant in every game , " he said .
" we have a lead at the top and that is comfortable , but we still need to win a few games before we can plan for the finals . "
in the third group a game played tuesday , azerbaijan pulled off a shock 1-0 win at home over a much-fancied turkey , who earlier in the week had gone down to germany in berlin .
the euro 2012 championships are to be held in poland and ukraine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.10.2010 germany 's khedira has gone from backup to bulwark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was germany 's heart and soul against turkey as a defensive stopper , sami khedira does n't post the sort of numbers that leap out at you from score sheets .
but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .

turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "

" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

its creator , michaela melian , wanted to forge a memorial that would draw the attention of young people and pervade the city . what are memorials , and is it important that they occupy public space ?
certainly they 're a call to remembrance and reflection , but does a " digital memorial " leave out something important by letting people choose when they observe it ?
in munich , an audio map titled memory loops by artist and musician michaela melian has raised questions like these .
the project is a digital memorial to the victims of national socialism in the bavarian capital .
it draws on archival and audio footage relating to the holocaust and can be accessed online in both german and english .
melian 's project arose from a juried competition in munich seeking new forms of remembrance for nazi victims .
the event was meant to address a city monument that had become obscure due to increasing car traffic nearby .
" memory loops analyzes the most varied historical dimensions by focusing on certain crystallization points in the city of munich .
using archival material and contemporary witness statements , melian artistically shapes voice-collages of the highest quality , " noted the jury .
but the idea also had detractors , including munich 's mayor , christian ude .
he reacted to melian 's proposal in 2008 by wondering whether " its means can be used to achieve an appropriate memorial . "
young voices two years later , the project has been opened and is accessible online as of late september 2010 -lrb- see the link to memory loops below -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michaela melian wanted the memory loops project to appeal to young audiences melian drew from newspapers and holocaust archives and conducted interviews personally to accumulate the material for the project .
then she sought out actors - especially children and other young voices - to speak and record the accounts she found .
" i really wanted the files to sound like young people , " explained melian .
" many victims were young when they left the camps or returned from russia . "
the stories reflect their daily struggles and the nazi regime 's gradual expansion of control over their lives .
one victim 's account is tagged to the address sonnenstrasse 116 , just beyond the city center : " once , there was an air raid warning as i was out in town and wearing the star .
i wanted to go down into a shelter nearby , but they did n't let the jew boy in .
the old botanical garden is a stone 's throw away .
i hid under a shrub and cried - bombs were falling left and right . "
atmospheric music the short audio files are linked to a map indicating where each scene actually occurred .
michaela melian composed the music that accompanies many of their statements , taking inspiration from jewish musicians and composers who collided with nazi ideology during that period .
" karl amadeus hartmann was forbidden from working back then , coco schumann was prevented from performing , and mendelssohn-bartholdy could only be performed by jewish musicians for jewish audiences , " said melian .
" those are facets of the story that i wanted to include in the audio files in a subliminal way . "
a city-wide memorial at the memory loops homepage , visitors can click on 175 blue circles in the english version - and 300 in the german edition - to hear the stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project is also available as an audio guide for mobile phones the project is also being supported by broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk and will be presented as a series of radio programs .
some munich museums are lending their support as well by making mp3 players available with which people can tour the city and hear the stories as they go .
a similar version in english can be downloaded and installed on smart phones .
memory loops is , then , a kind of monument that is spread out across the city .
" i wanted to use the media that occupy nearly all of young people 's free time as well as their working lives : the internet and cell phones .
these days , many young people spend more time on the internet than at any social or public places , " melian said .
intimate glimpses into history munich was a center of activity for the nazi party .
that 's why the city is particularly revealing for those who want to understand the forms of persecution to which nazi victims were subjected and what their lives were like .
" in 1935 , we had to leave the apartment and moved to a cheap and dark ground-floor apartment on trogerstrasse -lsb- troger street -rsb- .
it was very close to where hitler lived .
coming home from church once , we saw him in an open mercedes .
my father said to us , ' a little bomb would be just the thing here , " ' recalls one voice in the memory loops project .
it continues , " we lived extremely modestly .
the other boys at school had it pretty good at home - suddenly , their families had jobs and work , and of course their children were all in the hitler youth .
i had to keep quiet about how things were at home with me . "

its creator , michaela melian , wanted to forge a memorial that would draw the attention of young people and pervade the city . what are memorials , and is it important that they occupy public space ?
certainly they 're a call to remembrance and reflection , but does a " digital memorial " leave out something important by letting people choose when they observe it ?
in munich , an audio map titled memory loops by artist and musician michaela melian has raised questions like these .
the project is a digital memorial to the victims of national socialism in the bavarian capital .
it draws on archival and audio footage relating to the holocaust and can be accessed online in both german and english .
melian 's project arose from a juried competition in munich seeking new forms of remembrance for nazi victims .
the event was meant to address a city monument that had become obscure due to increasing car traffic nearby .
" memory loops analyzes the most varied historical dimensions by focusing on certain crystallization points in the city of munich .
using archival material and contemporary witness statements , melian artistically shapes voice-collages of the highest quality , " noted the jury .
but the idea also had detractors , including munich 's mayor , christian ude .
he reacted to melian 's proposal in 2008 by wondering whether " its means can be used to achieve an appropriate memorial . "
young voices two years later , the project has been opened and is accessible online as of late september 2010 -lrb- see the link to memory loops below -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michaela melian wanted the memory loops project to appeal to young audiences melian drew from newspapers and holocaust archives and conducted interviews personally to accumulate the material for the project .
then she sought out actors - especially children and other young voices - to speak and record the accounts she found .
" i really wanted the files to sound like young people , " explained melian .
" many victims were young when they left the camps or returned from russia . "
the stories reflect their daily struggles and the nazi regime 's gradual expansion of control over their lives .
one victim 's account is tagged to the address sonnenstrasse 116 , just beyond the city center : " once , there was an air raid warning as i was out in town and wearing the star .

atmospheric music the short audio files are linked to a map indicating where each scene actually occurred .
michaela melian composed the music that accompanies many of their statements , taking inspiration from jewish musicians and composers who collided with nazi ideology during that period .

but many observers say that its chances of succeeding are less than slim . in the current format , the un general assembly annually elects five new , non-permanent security council members to two-year terms to replace the five members that will leave the council at the end of december .
the 10 rotating seats are divided among five regions around the world .
only the united states , britain , france , russia and china hold permanent seats on the un security council and the power to veto all resolutions .
germany has been campaigning to join this elite group as part of a more comprehensive project to revamp the council for most of the past decade .
along with india , japan and brazil , germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the un system as part of the g-4 alliance .
the g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
under the alliance 's plan , four of the permanent six seats would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries .
germany 's determination to pursue its goal is supported by what many see as a justified attempt to receive recognition for its contribution to the modern un and more responsibility for a country of its international standing .
" germany is a significant player at the un , " richard gowan , an international relations expert at the european council on foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the mere fact that it pays 8 percent of the budget ensures that .
germany is a constructive voice not only on iran but on issues like peace-building in africa .
it 's a good citizen at the un . "
self-preservation at the heart of opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council continues to show a reluctance to change but after facing consistent opposition to individual and collective g-4 membership , germany 's efforts and that of the alliance appeared to have lost momentum in recent years , primarily due to the growing relationship between india and the united states , which has at times diverted new delhi 's focus , and japan 's insistence on evolving a formula that can not be opposed by the us .
washington 's opposition and that of other major powers to the g-4 plan has been a major stumbling block in recent years , while the so-called " coffee club " - an alliance of pakistan , italy , mexico , argentina , south korea and several other countries opposed to the g-4 - has also emerged as a rival to complicate the g-4 's attempts at reform .
" some permanent members of the security council , like china and russia , are suspicious of any reform that would dilute their power there , " said gowan . " within europe , italy is particularly opposed to germany 's ambitions . it fears that if germany won a permanent seat alongside britain and france , its own influence at the un would decline . "
" britain and france both have a strong rhetorical commitment to germany 's cause , " he added . " however , they will do nothing that compromises their own positions on the council . in the past , germany has campaigned for a permanent seat alongside japan , india and brazil . however , it is possible to imagine scenarios in which rapidly rising powers like brazil and india won permanent seats and germany and japan did not . " g-4 allies could be both a help and hindrance to germany with india set to rejuvenate the g-4 ahead of the 65th un general assembly with a series of meetings with alliance ministers aimed at getting the campaign back on-track , germany hopes a new vigor in the group 's collective efforts to reform the council can enhance its own campaign for a permanent seat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia prefers india and brazil as permanent members " but never underestimate how complex and nasty security council reform negotiations can become , " said gowan .
" the bloc politics are fantastically difficult .
germany also has to be realistic that , while its bid for a permanent seat is taken seriously , it 's actually peripheral to the question of whether india and japan should get such seats . " " the reasons are geopolitical : if india and japan were in the council full-time , it could become a serious center for debate on asian security issues .
it 's not clear whether china wants that .
germany 's presence would probably change the dynamics of the council rather less .
but it 's very hard to imagine a reform process that gave germany a permanent seat but exclude india . that would be political and historical lunacy . " experts unconvinced that german ambitions can be fulfilled a number of experts believe that germany is wasting its time to again lobby for a permanent seat , given the rise to prominence of other states in the geo-political arena , with some saying that the unlikelihood of success or the reform of the council could even persuade chancellor angela merkel to drop the campaign completely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the un : germany may have to accept defeat " it 's very unlikely that germany will try and resurrect their bid for a seat because there really is n't any hope of getting one , " michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" should the necessary reforms go through , the un will offer seats to the likes of india and brazil over germany , due to its policy of promoting the new powers and because of the over-representation of europe on the council . " " i would be very surprised if this attempt were to be successful , " dr. karen smith at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle .
" enlarging the permanent membership of the security council is , i would think , very unlikely to happen . " " the chances of germany getting a permanent seat with a veto comparable to france or britain 's are fairly low , " richard gowan concluded .
" but it could negotiate some sort of semi-permanent seat , one which only requires reelection once every five or 10 years , without a veto .
compromises of this sort have been on the table since the 2005 negotiations on security council reform , and are probably the most realistic option .

but many observers say that its chances of succeeding are less than slim . in the current format , the un general assembly annually elects five new , non-permanent security council members to two-year terms to replace the five members that will leave the council at the end of december .
the 10 rotating seats are divided among five regions around the world .
only the united states , britain , france , russia and china hold permanent seats on the un security council and the power to veto all resolutions .
germany has been campaigning to join this elite group as part of a more comprehensive project to revamp the council for most of the past decade .
along with india , japan and brazil , germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the un system as part of the g-4 alliance .
the g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
under the alliance 's plan , four of the permanent six seats would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries .
germany 's determination to pursue its goal is supported by what many see as a justified attempt to receive recognition for its contribution to the modern un and more responsibility for a country of its international standing .
" germany is a significant player at the un , " richard gowan , an international relations expert at the european council on foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the mere fact that it pays 8 percent of the budget ensures that .
germany is a constructive voice not only on iran but on issues like peace-building in africa .
it 's a good citizen at the un . "
self-preservation at the heart of opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council continues to show a reluctance to change but after facing consistent opposition to individual and collective g-4 membership , germany 's efforts and that of the alliance appeared to have lost momentum in recent years , primarily due to the growing relationship between india and the united states , which has at times diverted new delhi 's focus , and japan 's insistence on evolving a formula that can not be opposed by the us .
washington 's opposition and that of other major powers to the g-4 plan has been a major stumbling block in recent years , while the so-called " coffee club " - an alliance of pakistan , italy , mexico , argentina , south korea and several other countries opposed to the g-4 - has also emerged as a rival to complicate the g-4 's attempts at reform .
" some permanent members of the security council , like china and russia , are suspicious of any reform that would dilute their power there , " said gowan . " within europe , italy is particularly opposed to germany 's ambitions . it fears that if germany won a permanent seat alongside britain and france , its own influence at the un would decline . "
" britain and france both have a strong rhetorical commitment to germany 's cause , " he added . " however , they will do nothing that compromises their own positions on the council . in the past , germany has campaigned for a permanent seat alongside japan , india and brazil . however , it is possible to imagine scenarios in which rapidly rising powers like brazil and india won permanent seats and germany and japan did not . " g-4 allies could be both a help and hindrance to germany with india set to rejuvenate the g-4 ahead of the 65th un general assembly with a series of meetings with alliance ministers aimed at getting the campaign back on-track , germany hopes a new vigor in the group 's collective efforts to reform the council can enhance its own campaign for a permanent seat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia prefers india and brazil as permanent members " but never underestimate how complex and nasty security council reform negotiations can become , " said gowan .
" the bloc politics are fantastically difficult .
germany also has to be realistic that , while its bid for a permanent seat is taken seriously , it 's actually peripheral to the question of whether india and japan should get such seats . " " the reasons are geopolitical : if india and japan were in the council full-time , it could become a serious center for debate on asian security issues .
it 's not clear whether china wants that .
germany 's presence would probably change the dynamics of the council rather less .
but it 's very hard to imagine a reform process that gave germany a permanent seat but exclude india . that would be political and historical lunacy . " experts unconvinced that german ambitions can be fulfilled a number of experts believe that germany is wasting its time to again lobby for a permanent seat , given the rise to prominence of other states in the geo-political arena , with some saying that the unlikelihood of success or the reform of the council could even persuade chancellor angela merkel to drop the campaign completely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the un : germany may have to accept defeat " it 's very unlikely that germany will try and resurrect their bid for a seat because there really is n't any hope of getting one , " michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" should the necessary reforms go through , the un will offer seats to the likes of india and brazil over germany , due to its policy of promoting the new powers and because of the over-representation of europe on the council . " " i would be very surprised if this attempt were to be successful , " dr. karen smith at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle .
" enlarging the permanent membership of the security council is , i would think , very unlikely to happen . " " the chances of germany getting a permanent seat with a veto comparable to france or britain 's are fairly low , " richard gowan concluded .
" but it could negotiate some sort of semi-permanent seat , one which only requires reelection once every five or 10 years , without a veto .
compromises of this sort have been on the table since the 2005 negotiations on security council reform , and are probably the most realistic option .

" some permanent members of the security council , like china and russia , are suspicious of any reform that would dilute their power there , " said gowan . " within europe , italy is particularly opposed to germany 's ambitions . it fears that if germany won a permanent seat alongside britain and france , its own influence at the un would decline . "
" britain and france both have a strong rhetorical commitment to germany 's cause , " he added . " however , they will do nothing that compromises their own positions on the council . in the past , germany has campaigned for a permanent seat alongside japan , india and brazil . however , it is possible to imagine scenarios in which rapidly rising powers like brazil and india won permanent seats and germany and japan did not . " g-4 allies could be both a help and hindrance to germany with india set to rejuvenate the g-4 ahead of the 65th un general assembly with a series of meetings with alliance ministers aimed at getting the campaign back on-track , germany hopes a new vigor in the group 's collective efforts to reform the council can enhance its own campaign for a permanent seat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia prefers india and brazil as permanent members " but never underestimate how complex and nasty security council reform negotiations can become , " said gowan .
" the bloc politics are fantastically difficult .
germany also has to be realistic that , while its bid for a permanent seat is taken seriously , it 's actually peripheral to the question of whether india and japan should get such seats . " " the reasons are geopolitical : if india and japan were in the council full-time , it could become a serious center for debate on asian security issues .
it 's not clear whether china wants that .
germany 's presence would probably change the dynamics of the council rather less .
but it 's very hard to imagine a reform process that gave germany a permanent seat but exclude india . that would be political and historical lunacy . " experts unconvinced that german ambitions can be fulfilled a number of experts believe that germany is wasting its time to again lobby for a permanent seat , given the rise to prominence of other states in the geo-political arena , with some saying that the unlikelihood of success or the reform of the council could even persuade chancellor angela merkel to drop the campaign completely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the un : germany may have to accept defeat " it 's very unlikely that germany will try and resurrect their bid for a seat because there really is n't any hope of getting one , " michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" should the necessary reforms go through , the un will offer seats to the likes of india and brazil over germany , due to its policy of promoting the new powers and because of the over-representation of europe on the council . " " i would be very surprised if this attempt were to be successful , " dr. karen smith at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle .
" enlarging the permanent membership of the security council is , i would think , very unlikely to happen . " " the chances of germany getting a permanent seat with a veto comparable to france or britain 's are fairly low , " richard gowan concluded .
" but it could negotiate some sort of semi-permanent seat , one which only requires reelection once every five or 10 years , without a veto .
compromises of this sort have been on the table since the 2005 negotiations on security council reform , and are probably the most realistic option .

but many observers say that its chances of succeeding are less than slim . in the current format , the un general assembly annually elects five new , non-permanent security council members to two-year terms to replace the five members that will leave the council at the end of december .
the 10 rotating seats are divided among five regions around the world .
only the united states , britain , france , russia and china hold permanent seats on the un security council and the power to veto all resolutions .
germany has been campaigning to join this elite group as part of a more comprehensive project to revamp the council for most of the past decade .
along with india , japan and brazil , germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the un system as part of the g-4 alliance .
the g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
under the alliance 's plan , four of the permanent six seats would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries .
germany 's determination to pursue its goal is supported by what many see as a justified attempt to receive recognition for its contribution to the modern un and more responsibility for a country of its international standing .
" germany is a significant player at the un , " richard gowan , an international relations expert at the european council on foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the mere fact that it pays 8 percent of the budget ensures that .
germany is a constructive voice not only on iran but on issues like peace-building in africa .
it 's a good citizen at the un . "

the kazakhs held die mannschaft for the first 45 minutes of the encounter , but were unable to stem the germans ’ flow of attacking football in the second half .
the first goal came from miroslav klose , who , finding the net for the third time in two games , slotted home three minutes after the break .
substitute mario gomez added a second goal in the 78th minute and lukas podolski put the final touch on the score line five minutes from fulltime .
the victory puts germany at the top of their group on 12 points , five clear of their nearest rival austria , who played out a thrilling 4-4 draw with belgium in tuesday 's late game .
the loss leaves kazakhstan bottom of the group with zero points .
germany coach joachim loew said that he was pleased with the result : " we achieved what we wanted to do , but obviously some errors occurred . "
" we have 12 points .
that is what we wanted , so i have to be satisfied .
what the team managed to achieve this year has been great , i ca n't expect them to be brilliant in every game , " he said .
" we have a lead at the top and that is comfortable , but we still need to win a few games before we can plan for the finals . "
in the third group a game played tuesday , azerbaijan pulled off a shock 1-0 win at home over a much-fancied turkey , who earlier in the week had gone down to germany in berlin .
the euro 2012 championships are to be held in poland and ukraine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus : debate surrounds google 's plans for street view in germany street view brings privacy debate to german mainstream , blogger says why oberstaufen , a southern german town , supports google street view google responds to street view criticism in germany google seeks to ease german opposition to street view privacy -pipe- 12.10.2010 deadline looms for germans to blur homes from google street view großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last day for germans to opt-out is october 15 google plans to launch its street view project in germany 's 20 biggest cities by the end of the year .
but not all germans are happy that their homes , cars and even themselves could be online for all to see . some 1 million germans make use of the street view service daily for a virtual ground 's eye look of the world , according to google .
but the company has been heavily criticized in germany as it gets ready to put maps of german cities online , which the company plans to do by the end of the year .
much of that criticism has come from the southern german state of bavaria , and the region around the city of ingolstadt in particular .
" the problem with google street view is that google - without asking - has gone and photographed german houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used , " georg schaeff , the publisher of the ingolstadt-based daily donaukurier , told deutsche welle .
the newspaper has publicized local opposition to the service for the last two years .
that 's a problem in germany since the country 's highest court has affirmed citizens ' rights to control who has their personal information and how it 's used .
google gives ground " we take privacy very seriously , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service . "
the california tech giant has made concessions to german privacy advocates by allowing material to be made unrecognizable before being published , which it has n't done in the other 23 countries street view is online .
furthermore , after facing widespread criticism , it doubled the opt-out period to eight weeks , which ends on friday .
some 200,000 people have taken google up on the offer to have their homes or apartment building blurred , according to a report in the german news magazine der spiegel .
google , which automatically blurs the faces and vehicle license plates its computer can recognize and asks users to point out the ones it misses , has not commented on the number of opt-out it has received .
bildunterschrift : some 200,000 people have removed themselves from street view , a german magazine reported but schaeff said people have no way of making sure what they see as a violation of their privacy really gets deleted .
he added that citizens have little recourse if google does n't agree with their claim of a privacy infringement by the panoramic photos of whatever is visible from the street taken by the eight cameras mounted on the company 's car .
" individual citizens ca n't assert themselves against these kinds of companies , " he said .
" and the corporations do n't bother to consider if what they are doing is illegal or not .
google works on the premise of ' why ask for permission when you can beg for forgiveness after the fact ? " '
privacy rift but privacy advocates still have a lot of convincing to do .
some 41 percent of germans see more positive than negative aspects to street view and 16 percent say they have or will remove their homes from the service , according to an august study by the emnid research institute .
many ingolstadt locals agreed with the poll 's sentiment .
" google can go ahead and do it , because everyone leaves their tracks all over the internet and everywhere else , " said ingo zingel , an ingolstadt resident .
" whether someone takes a picture of the door to my house really does n't matter . "
schaeff said he 's not surprised that some people do n't seem concerned about what 's happening to their personal information .
" i think there is a rift in society where half the people do n't see a problem and do n't know what 's coming down the road , " he said .
" the other half is much more sensitive and is more careful because the situation is far from clear . "
what 's unclear , he added , is how images from street view - or any other type of geodata , such as that collected by mobile phone providers - can be used to create profiles of individuals that are later sold to third parties .
without knowing how personal data will be used , he said people should give out as little as possible .
" each piece of personal information is like a stone that creates a mosaic , " schaeff said .
" every little stone plays a meaningful role , but , unfortunately , you ca n't tell what the role is until the whole picture has been made . "
' sensible areas ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 41 percent germans said street view has more positive than negative aspects but there are some pictures thomas herker , the mayor of pfaffenhofen , just south of ingolstadt , said he knows he does n't want made .
while he insisted that city hall and pubic offices be visible in street view , he added that some public buildings should be unrecognizable on the internet .
" we requested that google remove public kindergartens and schools , " he said referring to a letter the city sent in december 2009 to google 's german headquarters in hamburg .
" two weeks ago we were told they would not do it because only private individuals - not municipalities - have a right to remove property . "
herker led a group of bavarian mayors which sent another request to google asking for the company to respect their wishes and remove kindergartens and other " sensible areas " from street view .
while herker is left hoping google accounts for his city 's wishes , the point may become moot if the service goes online as planned by the end of the year .
the last time herker wrote to google it took 10 months to get a form letter response .
if it takes that long again the pictures will have long been online for all to see .
" there are three companies in germany that , in my opinion , are problematic : deutsche telekom , deutsche bahn , and now i 've added google to the list , " he said .
" i can only hope that google will change its mind and make it possible to remove public property from the service . "

deutsche welle : oberstaufen made a video and even baked a cake for google .
is that right ? bianca keybach : yes , we made a cake for google to welcome them and we put it into our facebook fan page and afterward we sent an invitation to google to say that we would be glad to welcome them here , and then google contacted us and we will see what happens .
when google contacted you , what happened ?
they were thankful for being so positive because this was a very big discussion in germany , -lsb- due to privacy -rsb- and taking pictures and everybody says we do n't want that .
we were one of the towns that said we would like -lsb- street view -rsb- .
tell me why you want google taking street view photographs in your town ?
what do you hope to accomplish other than to show how great the town is ?
i think that it would be an additional service for our guests .
when they are choosing a hotel or reading our brochures or they look at our homepage and they ca n't really say if everything is true , if there is a big street next to the hotel .
with google street view they can look into the town and discover the street , discover the region and after the holidays they can show their family and friends where they have been and what they can recommend .

have they actually sent a car to oberstaufen ?
they 've been here last year or at the beginning of this year .
they were in oberstaufen .
nobody saw them , though .
they took pictures and they have them and we 'll all waiting if there 's any chance that we can go on street view as soon as possible .
some have argued against street view because they say criminals could use it to plan robberies .
do you think that 's a valid argument ?
that 's a very interesting argument , because it 's one of the most important arguments for the critics but i think it 's crazy because the pictures were taken five or 10 months ago and they will be online for five or 10 years .
but if i want to get into a house and commit a crime , i wo n't use a picture that is many years old .
i could just use a postcard , for example , as a basis for burglary .
i think that 's not very realistic , but it 's very nice for a symbolic discussion .
are you surprised that there have n't been more cities that have welcomed google like oberstaufen has ?
i was not surprised because usually in germany you wait -lsb- to not draw attention to yourself -rsb- .
as long as you 're waiting , nobody is criticizing you .
i think it 's german , and it 's normal that no other towns really said , " we like google and we welcome google and we see a lot of positive aspects in this theme . "
after we said we like google and we support google street view , in our region , other towns and villages said , " we like would like to have them here , but you have to be the pioneer . "
we are glad that we decided to be very open .
now you mentioned earlier that you sent google a cake .
what kind of cake was it ?
i think it was a chocolate cake that was covered in frosting .
we just took a picture of the cake and sent the picture by e-mail , by twitter and we put it on facebook and we sent a real invitation that as soon as they come to take the other pictures of oberstaufen we will welcome them with the original cake .

" it 's hard enough to find a steady job and if this goes through it will be even harder , " she added .
sarkozy pledges to persevere sarkozy 's pension plan is quickly becoming one of the biggest battles of his presidency , pitting him against unions that crushed a previous attempt to reform the system in 1995 .

but not all germans are happy that their homes , cars and even themselves could be online for all to see . some 1 million germans make use of the street view service daily for a virtual ground 's eye look of the world , according to google .
but the company has been heavily criticized in germany as it gets ready to put maps of german cities online , which the company plans to do by the end of the year .
much of that criticism has come from the southern german state of bavaria , and the region around the city of ingolstadt in particular .
" the problem with google street view is that google - without asking - has gone and photographed german houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used , " georg schaeff , the publisher of the ingolstadt-based daily donaukurier , told deutsche welle .
the newspaper has publicized local opposition to the service for the last two years .
that 's a problem in germany since the country 's highest court has affirmed citizens ' rights to control who has their personal information and how it 's used .
google gives ground " we take privacy very seriously , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service . "
the california tech giant has made concessions to german privacy advocates by allowing material to be made unrecognizable before being published , which it has n't done in the other 23 countries street view is online .
furthermore , after facing widespread criticism , it doubled the opt-out period to eight weeks , which ends on friday .
some 200,000 people have taken google up on the offer to have their homes or apartment building blurred , according to a report in the german news magazine der spiegel .
google , which automatically blurs the faces and vehicle license plates its computer can recognize and asks users to point out the ones it misses , has not commented on the number of opt-out it has received .
bildunterschrift : some 200,000 people have removed themselves from street view , a german magazine reported but schaeff said people have no way of making sure what they see as a violation of their privacy really gets deleted .
he added that citizens have little recourse if google does n't agree with their claim of a privacy infringement by the panoramic photos of whatever is visible from the street taken by the eight cameras mounted on the company 's car .
" individual citizens ca n't assert themselves against these kinds of companies , " he said .
" and the corporations do n't bother to consider if what they are doing is illegal or not .
google works on the premise of ' why ask for permission when you can beg for forgiveness after the fact ? " '
privacy rift but privacy advocates still have a lot of convincing to do .
some 41 percent of germans see more positive than negative aspects to street view and 16 percent say they have or will remove their homes from the service , according to an august study by the emnid research institute .
many ingolstadt locals agreed with the poll 's sentiment .
" google can go ahead and do it , because everyone leaves their tracks all over the internet and everywhere else , " said ingo zingel , an ingolstadt resident .
" whether someone takes a picture of the door to my house really does n't matter . "
schaeff said he 's not surprised that some people do n't seem concerned about what 's happening to their personal information .
" i think there is a rift in society where half the people do n't see a problem and do n't know what 's coming down the road , " he said .
" the other half is much more sensitive and is more careful because the situation is far from clear . "
what 's unclear , he added , is how images from street view - or any other type of geodata , such as that collected by mobile phone providers - can be used to create profiles of individuals that are later sold to third parties .
without knowing how personal data will be used , he said people should give out as little as possible .
" each piece of personal information is like a stone that creates a mosaic , " schaeff said .
" every little stone plays a meaningful role , but , unfortunately , you ca n't tell what the role is until the whole picture has been made . "
' sensible areas ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 41 percent germans said street view has more positive than negative aspects but there are some pictures thomas herker , the mayor of pfaffenhofen , just south of ingolstadt , said he knows he does n't want made .
while he insisted that city hall and pubic offices be visible in street view , he added that some public buildings should be unrecognizable on the internet .
" we requested that google remove public kindergartens and schools , " he said referring to a letter the city sent in december 2009 to google 's german headquarters in hamburg .
" two weeks ago we were told they would not do it because only private individuals - not municipalities - have a right to remove property . "
herker led a group of bavarian mayors which sent another request to google asking for the company to respect their wishes and remove kindergartens and other " sensible areas " from street view .
while herker is left hoping google accounts for his city 's wishes , the point may become moot if the service goes online as planned by the end of the year .
the last time herker wrote to google it took 10 months to get a form letter response .
if it takes that long again the pictures will have long been online for all to see .
" there are three companies in germany that , in my opinion , are problematic : deutsche telekom , deutsche bahn , and now i 've added google to the list , " he said .
" i can only hope that google will change its mind and make it possible to remove public property from the service . "

but not all germans are happy that their homes , cars and even themselves could be online for all to see . some 1 million germans make use of the street view service daily for a virtual ground 's eye look of the world , according to google .
but the company has been heavily criticized in germany as it gets ready to put maps of german cities online , which the company plans to do by the end of the year .
much of that criticism has come from the southern german state of bavaria , and the region around the city of ingolstadt in particular .
" the problem with google street view is that google - without asking - has gone and photographed german houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used , " georg schaeff , the publisher of the ingolstadt-based daily donaukurier , told deutsche welle .
the newspaper has publicized local opposition to the service for the last two years .
that 's a problem in germany since the country 's highest court has affirmed citizens ' rights to control who has their personal information and how it 's used .
google gives ground " we take privacy very seriously , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .

the two-day conference is being held in the romanian capital , bucharest . european union officials , romanian politicians and roma representatives are discussing integration issues regarding europe 's roma population at a two-day eu conference held in romania 's capital , bucharest .
the conference is aimed at finding solutions on how to achieve more with the money spent by the european union on integrating roma , said the european commissioner for employment and social affairs , laszlo andor , at the opening of the conference .
" a lot has been done in terms of strategic planning , coordination and implementation , but at the end of the day , not much has really changed . " he said .
andor wants eu member states to become more engaged in integrating their roma population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " not much has really changed " - andor said at the conference " the eu can not solve the multi-layered problems of the roma by itself , " he said .
" the european union is ready to step up its efforts for roma integration , but that is also what we expect from all member states . "
funding is available , yet few members take the money even though the european union has funds available , member states refrain from using the money .
from 2007 until 2013 , the european social fund offered 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.1 billion -rrb- to help finance education and housing projects for roma .
especially countries with a high number of roma population like hungary , bulgaria and romania were expected make use of the funds .
the eu has installed a task force in order to find out why member states do not act even though the funds are available .
the task force is expected to present its results by the end of this year .
hungarian prime minister viktor orban said that the integration of roma would be one of the main focuses in hungary 's term in the eu presidency beginning in january .
according to andor , france 's drastic measures of expelling thousands of roma were " very unfortunate " , but " ironically energized the discussions on roma inclusion . "
problem of roma integration will not affect schengen talks german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting romanian prime minister emil boc that the problem of roma integration would not affect negotiations on romania becoming part of the schengen zone .
being a country within the schengen treaty would give romanian citizen visa-free travel within the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a long way from the end of the road , " - according to chancellor merkel merkel said that germany would judge romania 's development on their way to the schengen treaty fairly - but did not promise a quick entrance to the schengen zone .
" the reforms of the judiciary and of interior affairs are being tackled very courageously , but you are still a long way from the end of the road , " merkel said . " we back romania 's efforts to join the schengen zone ... but we must make sure that visa delivery procedures are not marred by corruption , " she said .
it is crucial that romania only issue visas without signs of corruption or unregularities and that eu 's external borders are safe .
" there are no reasonable alternatives to transparent and clear legal terms . " romania is hoping to enter the schengen zone in the middle of 2011 .
the country has been a member of the eu since 2007 .
most of europe 's roma are said to live in romania , but there are no reliable numbers - with figures ranging from a population of 530,000 up to 2.5 million .

" learn german !
adjust to the customs of your host country , " he told daily newspaper bild in an interview published on tuesday .
" you do n't have to give up the gift of your identity and culture , but rather think of yourselves as ambassadors for turkey .
only then can you build bridges for a better friendship and partnership between our countries . "
three days before his comments were published , german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan met in berlin on the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between the two countries , pledging to cooperate more on integration of turks living in germany .
multi-faceted integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to work together on integration ines michalowski , a senior researcher at berlin 's social science research center , said the call for turkish-germans to maintain their culture while still adjusting to german customs may seem paradoxical , but that the two are not mutually exclusive .
" the turkish nation-state is a very nationalistic nation , where there are actually claims of turks belonging to the turkish nation-state even though they have been living abroad for several generations , " she told deutsche welle .
" but that does n't mean that integration on the labor market , or in the educational system , or contacts with germans - that these aspects of integration go badly . "
still , research shows that most turkish germans are poorly integrated in these areas - a fact which haci halil uslucan , director of the center for turkish studies and integration research , said can not be entirely attributed to a perceived lack of motivation of immigrants to integrate themselves .
" i think we also have to focus on the conditions of being integrated - and that means the attitudes of the majority , the look of the majority on the minority , " he told deutsche welle .
" the political discussion should not go in this direction of creating ranks - these are the good immigrants and these are the bad ones .
that only increases social tension . "
education is key bagis also said in his interview that turkish-german parents should send their children " to the best schools , so that they have a future , " echoing comments by prime minister erdogan that turkish-germans should prioritize education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research shows other minorities have integrated better than turks michalowski said studies of vietnamese immigrant parents in the eastern state of brandenburg have shown their children to have higher high-school graduation and college entrance rates than non-immigrant german children , partly because the parents place a high priority on education .
" some of the criticism has been that maybe turkish parents are not putting enough emphasis on getting a good education within germany , " she said .
" so if there is a government official from turkey who actually encourages people to pay more attention to the education of their children , i think that can never do any harm . "
but uslucan said other research shows that turkish-german parents have high educational aspirations for their children , and that teachers often send young turkish students to lower-level high schools that do not feed into universities , even when their educational performance is as good as their non-turkish peers .
" the doctrine must be that turkish parents should have more information about the german educational system , " he said .
" i think there is the problem that turkish parents do n't have enough information on what the best school is . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has made entry into the eu a high priority ambassadors for turkish eu accession in addition to his post as eu affairs minister , bagis is also chiefly responsible for negotiating turkey 's accession into the bloc .
while merkel has called turkey 's accession process " open-ended with no guarantees , " the turkish government has made it a high priority .
michalowski said bagis 's call on immigrants to integrate could be seen as a way of enhancing turkey 's chances of gaining eu membership .
" if you have a well-integrated minority , people in germany may be more favorable to the idea of turkey becoming a member of the european union than if the turkish community is always in the media as being badly integrated , " she said .

" learn german !
adjust to the customs of your host country , " he told daily newspaper bild in an interview published on tuesday .
" you do n't have to give up the gift of your identity and culture , but rather think of yourselves as ambassadors for turkey .
only then can you build bridges for a better friendship and partnership between our countries . "
three days before his comments were published , german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan met in berlin on the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between the two countries , pledging to cooperate more on integration of turks living in germany .
multi-faceted integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to work together on integration ines michalowski , a senior researcher at berlin 's social science research center , said the call for turkish-germans to maintain their culture while still adjusting to german customs may seem paradoxical , but that the two are not mutually exclusive .
" the turkish nation-state is a very nationalistic nation , where there are actually claims of turks belonging to the turkish nation-state even though they have been living abroad for several generations , " she told deutsche welle .
" but that does n't mean that integration on the labor market , or in the educational system , or contacts with germans - that these aspects of integration go badly . "
still , research shows that most turkish germans are poorly integrated in these areas - a fact which haci halil uslucan , director of the center for turkish studies and integration research , said can not be entirely attributed to a perceived lack of motivation of immigrants to integrate themselves .
" i think we also have to focus on the conditions of being integrated - and that means the attitudes of the majority , the look of the majority on the minority , " he told deutsche welle .
" the political discussion should not go in this direction of creating ranks - these are the good immigrants and these are the bad ones .
that only increases social tension . "
education is key bagis also said in his interview that turkish-german parents should send their children " to the best schools , so that they have a future , " echoing comments by prime minister erdogan that turkish-germans should prioritize education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research shows other minorities have integrated better than turks michalowski said studies of vietnamese immigrant parents in the eastern state of brandenburg have shown their children to have higher high-school graduation and college entrance rates than non-immigrant german children , partly because the parents place a high priority on education .
" some of the criticism has been that maybe turkish parents are not putting enough emphasis on getting a good education within germany , " she said .
" so if there is a government official from turkey who actually encourages people to pay more attention to the education of their children , i think that can never do any harm . "
but uslucan said other research shows that turkish-german parents have high educational aspirations for their children , and that teachers often send young turkish students to lower-level high schools that do not feed into universities , even when their educational performance is as good as their non-turkish peers .
" the doctrine must be that turkish parents should have more information about the german educational system , " he said .
" i think there is the problem that turkish parents do n't have enough information on what the best school is . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has made entry into the eu a high priority ambassadors for turkish eu accession in addition to his post as eu affairs minister , bagis is also chiefly responsible for negotiating turkey 's accession into the bloc .
while merkel has called turkey 's accession process " open-ended with no guarantees , " the turkish government has made it a high priority .
michalowski said bagis 's call on immigrants to integrate could be seen as a way of enhancing turkey 's chances of gaining eu membership .
" if you have a well-integrated minority , people in germany may be more favorable to the idea of turkey becoming a member of the european union than if the turkish community is always in the media as being badly integrated , " she said .

inefficient water use and pollution are among the major factors . while tourists are enjoying their vacation on the white beaches and at the well-maintained hotel pools , bali 's children are playing near polluted , stinking rivers .
there is hardly any sewage treatment in indonesia .
waste water from industry , agriculture and private homes mostly pours into the nearest stream or river , without any filtering .
health problems according to estimates by the world health organization , about 50,000 people die from illnesses related to polluted water in indonesia every year .
and there are approximately 120 million cases of diarrhoea , skin diseases and other illnesses caused by contaminated water annually .
yuyun ismawati , the director of the environmental group balifokus , says : " in some areas , people are getting used to using bad water , so they kind of build up their immune system and do not get sick very easily .
but in some areas , especially for visitors and tourists , it affects their stomach and they get diarrhoea and so on . "

this begins at the family level , yuyun ismawati emphasizes . " children are especially affected .
and in many cases when children get diarrhoea , that also affects their parents because they can not go to work .
and most of them rely on daily wages , so they will lose their income on that day .
or if the children who suffer from diarrhoea are of school age , they lose one day 's opportunity to go to school . "
tourists use more water in bali , the group maintains , the existing water resources are only enough to support a population of 2.7 million people .
by now , the island ’ s population has grown to 3.5 million .
and that does not include the more than 4 million tourists that visit bali every year .
most of them have no idea how much water they use every day .
" not very much .
i imagine it wouldn ’ t be more than 40 liters , " says one man .
" showers are very quick - 20 to 40 liters . "
another tourist guesses wildly : " about 10 liters : take a shower , drinking – oh , no , maybe it is up to 100 liters . "
bildunterschrift : hotels in bali use 500 liters of water per day and room in fact , it is 500 liters per day and hotel room in bali ’ s tourist areas , says the ngo balifokus , which specializes in water issues and wastewater management .
the figure for tourists is much higher than for the general population , taking into account not only the water for the showers , but also for the swimming pool and the watering of the hotel garden .
paradise lost yuyun ismawati from balifokus sees trouble ahead for the fabled ' island of the gods ' : " i think in the next 20 years , we might not be recognized as a paradise island any more because paradise should not be congested , paradise should not be stinky . "
in order to save the island , balifokus is currently developing projects for sewage treatment in cooperation with the bremen overseas research and development association , or borda , from the german city of bremen .
in 2009 , balifokus ' director yuyun ismawati was awarded the goldman environmental prize for grassroots environmental action .

tourists use more water in bali , the group maintains , the existing water resources are only enough to support a population of 2.7 million people .
by now , the island ’ s population has grown to 3.5 million .
and that does not include the more than 4 million tourists that visit bali every year .
most of them have no idea how much water they use every day .
" not very much .
i imagine it wouldn ’ t be more than 40 liters , " says one man .

inefficient water use and pollution are among the major factors . while tourists are enjoying their vacation on the white beaches and at the well-maintained hotel pools , bali 's children are playing near polluted , stinking rivers .
there is hardly any sewage treatment in indonesia .
waste water from industry , agriculture and private homes mostly pours into the nearest stream or river , without any filtering .
health problems according to estimates by the world health organization , about 50,000 people die from illnesses related to polluted water in indonesia every year .
and there are approximately 120 million cases of diarrhoea , skin diseases and other illnesses caused by contaminated water annually .
yuyun ismawati , the director of the environmental group balifokus , says : " in some areas , people are getting used to using bad water , so they kind of build up their immune system and do not get sick very easily .
but in some areas , especially for visitors and tourists , it affects their stomach and they get diarrhoea and so on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yuyun ismawati receives the goldman environmental prize waterborne diseases not only affect people ’ s health , but also have an economic fallout .

"
he is hoping his visit will help promote “ sensible arrangements . ”
but observers are skeptical . economics minister rainer bruederle has framed his two-day trip to china , which began in beijing on tuesday , as a pacifying mission , following recent acrimony between china and many g-20 countries over trade .
" the danger of a trade war has appeared on the horizon , " bruederle told reporters traveling with him on his two-day trip to china , which is to include stops in beijing and shanghai .
the minister warned that accusations of currency manipulation should not be allowed to escalate , and protectionism must be avoided .
some of china 's trading partners in the us and europe have recently accused beijing of allowing the yuan to depreciate at a faster pace .
critics say the unit could be undervalued by as much as 40 percent .
ambassador and missionary speaking in beijing , bruederle refuted these claims , pointing out that the yuan had increased in value by 15 to 17 percent in the past two years , and he added that he did not expect the chinese government to adopt flexible trading patterns in the future .
" we must not allow the situation to get out of hand , or turn our backs on free trade , " bruederle said , adding that he saw himself as an " ambassador , perhaps even a missionary , for the fight against protectionism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has faced pressure from the eu over currency depreciation bruederle expressed satisfaction with the state of german-chinese trade , which has grown significantly this year .
german exports to china have grown by 52 percent to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of this year , while chinese exports have risen by 34 percent , compared to 2009 figures .
germany is considered one of china 's best friends in the west .
" the germans have been pushing for an open trade policy towards china , " jonathan holslag of the brussels institute of contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" germany 's economic revival after the financial crisis has been - to a large degree - made in china . "
" most of the expansion in germany 's exports – particularly cars and machinery – has been bound for china , " says holslag .
for this reason , holslag believes , the german government has often cautioned against protectionism towards china .
" angela merkel has also openly expressed her support for granting china market economy status , " holslag points out .
" this would make it more difficult for the european commission to apply anti-dumping procedures . "
good on the small-scale , not so much on the large-scale but despite germany 's huge economic interest in china – not only through exports , but also through direct investment from individual companies – bruederle 's leverage during this trip is likely to be limited .
the minister said that one of his main aims for the trip was to ensure that medium-sized german businesses gained better opportunities in china .
after his meetings with chinese commerce minister chen deming and zhang ping , the head of the country 's top economic planning agency , bruederle said he had been assured that german companies could take part in open competition in china provided they used a minimum of 50 percent local products .
but holslag believes this is a secondary priority for bruederle compared to maintaining export agreements .
" it 's important to distinguish degrees of urgency , " he says .
" the most important objective for the german government is to step up exports , and the second level is access to the chinese market .
germany is likely to be very cautious in negotiations , in order to protect exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery has been largely based on exports to china but despite this , there is concern that german companies are being disadvantaged by the chinese government .
rolf langhammer , vice-president of the kiel institute for the world economy , believes that this is where bruederle can at least make sure german businesses can get their voices heard .
" germany enjoys a very good position in china compared to other european countries , but of course there are barriers to mid-sized german companies , " he told deutsche welle .
" a lot of representatives of these firms are accompanying bruederle . "
langhammer does not think that bruederle can apply much pressure on the question of global exchange rates – the issue he addressed on arrival .
" the chinese government has always made clear that it wo n't let itself be influenced on this subject , and bruederle 's visit wo n't change anything in the discussion about the exchange rate . "
langhammer is also unconvinced by bruederle 's attempt to position himself as a mediator between the china and the west .
" that 's a role he can not play , " he says .
" he is much too small for that .
he does n't speak for the eurozone , he speaks for an export country called germany .
of course he can represent the interests of mid-sized companies , and he can voice their concerns if they feel themselves disadvantaged alongside chinese competition , but he ca n't solve the big questions – and he ca n't be a mediator in them . "

" angela merkel has also openly expressed her support for granting china market economy status , " holslag points out .
" this would make it more difficult for the european commission to apply anti-dumping procedures . "
good on the small-scale , not so much on the large-scale but despite germany 's huge economic interest in china – not only through exports , but also through direct investment from individual companies – bruederle 's leverage during this trip is likely to be limited .
the minister said that one of his main aims for the trip was to ensure that medium-sized german businesses gained better opportunities in china .
after his meetings with chinese commerce minister chen deming and zhang ping , the head of the country 's top economic planning agency , bruederle said he had been assured that german companies could take part in open competition in china provided they used a minimum of 50 percent local products .
but holslag believes this is a secondary priority for bruederle compared to maintaining export agreements .
" it 's important to distinguish degrees of urgency , " he says .
" the most important objective for the german government is to step up exports , and the second level is access to the chinese market .
germany is likely to be very cautious in negotiations , in order to protect exports . "

" germany enjoys a very good position in china compared to other european countries , but of course there are barriers to mid-sized german companies , " he told deutsche welle .
" a lot of representatives of these firms are accompanying bruederle . "
langhammer does not think that bruederle can apply much pressure on the question of global exchange rates – the issue he addressed on arrival .
" the chinese government has always made clear that it wo n't let itself be influenced on this subject , and bruederle 's visit wo n't change anything in the discussion about the exchange rate . "
langhammer is also unconvinced by bruederle 's attempt to position himself as a mediator between the china and the west .
" that 's a role he can not play , " he says .
" he is much too small for that .
he does n't speak for the eurozone , he speaks for an export country called germany .
of course he can represent the interests of mid-sized companies , and he can voice their concerns if they feel themselves disadvantaged alongside chinese competition , but he ca n't solve the big questions – and he ca n't be a mediator in them . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 12.10.2010 german economics minister warns of ' trade war ' with china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle arrived in china on tuesday economics minister rainer bruederle began his two-day trip to china with warnings of a " trade war . "
he is hoping his visit will help promote “ sensible arrangements . ”
but observers are skeptical . economics minister rainer bruederle has framed his two-day trip to china , which began in beijing on tuesday , as a pacifying mission , following recent acrimony between china and many g-20 countries over trade .
" the danger of a trade war has appeared on the horizon , " bruederle told reporters traveling with him on his two-day trip to china , which is to include stops in beijing and shanghai .
the minister warned that accusations of currency manipulation should not be allowed to escalate , and protectionism must be avoided .
some of china 's trading partners in the us and europe have recently accused beijing of allowing the yuan to depreciate at a faster pace .
critics say the unit could be undervalued by as much as 40 percent .
ambassador and missionary speaking in beijing , bruederle refuted these claims , pointing out that the yuan had increased in value by 15 to 17 percent in the past two years , and he added that he did not expect the chinese government to adopt flexible trading patterns in the future .
" we must not allow the situation to get out of hand , or turn our backs on free trade , " bruederle said , adding that he saw himself as an " ambassador , perhaps even a missionary , for the fight against protectionism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has faced pressure from the eu over currency depreciation bruederle expressed satisfaction with the state of german-chinese trade , which has grown significantly this year .
german exports to china have grown by 52 percent to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of this year , while chinese exports have risen by 34 percent , compared to 2009 figures .
germany is considered one of china 's best friends in the west .
" the germans have been pushing for an open trade policy towards china , " jonathan holslag of the brussels institute of contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" germany 's economic revival after the financial crisis has been - to a large degree - made in china . "
" most of the expansion in germany 's exports – particularly cars and machinery – has been bound for china , " says holslag .
for this reason , holslag believes , the german government has often cautioned against protectionism towards china .
" angela merkel has also openly expressed her support for granting china market economy status , " holslag points out .
" this would make it more difficult for the european commission to apply anti-dumping procedures . "

but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

its creator , michaela melian , wanted to forge a memorial that would draw the attention of young people and pervade the city . what are memorials , and is it important that they occupy public space ?
certainly they 're a call to remembrance and reflection , but does a " digital memorial " leave out something important by letting people choose when they observe it ?
in munich , an audio map titled memory loops by artist and musician michaela melian has raised questions like these .
the project is a digital memorial to the victims of national socialism in the bavarian capital .
it draws on archival and audio footage relating to the holocaust and can be accessed online in both german and english .
melian 's project arose from a juried competition in munich seeking new forms of remembrance for nazi victims .
the event was meant to address a city monument that had become obscure due to increasing car traffic nearby .
" memory loops analyzes the most varied historical dimensions by focusing on certain crystallization points in the city of munich .
using archival material and contemporary witness statements , melian artistically shapes voice-collages of the highest quality , " noted the jury .
but the idea also had detractors , including munich 's mayor , christian ude .
he reacted to melian 's proposal in 2008 by wondering whether " its means can be used to achieve an appropriate memorial . "
young voices two years later , the project has been opened and is accessible online as of late september 2010 -lrb- see the link to memory loops below -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michaela melian wanted the memory loops project to appeal to young audiences melian drew from newspapers and holocaust archives and conducted interviews personally to accumulate the material for the project .
then she sought out actors - especially children and other young voices - to speak and record the accounts she found .
" i really wanted the files to sound like young people , " explained melian .
" many victims were young when they left the camps or returned from russia . "
the stories reflect their daily struggles and the nazi regime 's gradual expansion of control over their lives .
one victim 's account is tagged to the address sonnenstrasse 116 , just beyond the city center : " once , there was an air raid warning as i was out in town and wearing the star .
i wanted to go down into a shelter nearby , but they did n't let the jew boy in .
the old botanical garden is a stone 's throw away .
i hid under a shrub and cried - bombs were falling left and right . "
atmospheric music the short audio files are linked to a map indicating where each scene actually occurred .
michaela melian composed the music that accompanies many of their statements , taking inspiration from jewish musicians and composers who collided with nazi ideology during that period .
" karl amadeus hartmann was forbidden from working back then , coco schumann was prevented from performing , and mendelssohn-bartholdy could only be performed by jewish musicians for jewish audiences , " said melian .
" those are facets of the story that i wanted to include in the audio files in a subliminal way . "
a city-wide memorial at the memory loops homepage , visitors can click on 175 blue circles in the english version - and 300 in the german edition - to hear the stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project is also available as an audio guide for mobile phones the project is also being supported by broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk and will be presented as a series of radio programs .
some munich museums are lending their support as well by making mp3 players available with which people can tour the city and hear the stories as they go .
a similar version in english can be downloaded and installed on smart phones .
memory loops is , then , a kind of monument that is spread out across the city .
" i wanted to use the media that occupy nearly all of young people 's free time as well as their working lives : the internet and cell phones .
these days , many young people spend more time on the internet than at any social or public places , " melian said .
intimate glimpses into history munich was a center of activity for the nazi party .
that 's why the city is particularly revealing for those who want to understand the forms of persecution to which nazi victims were subjected and what their lives were like .
" in 1935 , we had to leave the apartment and moved to a cheap and dark ground-floor apartment on trogerstrasse -lsb- troger street -rsb- .
it was very close to where hitler lived .
coming home from church once , we saw him in an open mercedes .
my father said to us , ' a little bomb would be just the thing here , " ' recalls one voice in the memory loops project .
it continues , " we lived extremely modestly .
the other boys at school had it pretty good at home - suddenly , their families had jobs and work , and of course their children were all in the hitler youth .
i had to keep quiet about how things were at home with me . "

but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

its creator , michaela melian , wanted to forge a memorial that would draw the attention of young people and pervade the city . what are memorials , and is it important that they occupy public space ?
certainly they 're a call to remembrance and reflection , but does a " digital memorial " leave out something important by letting people choose when they observe it ?
in munich , an audio map titled memory loops by artist and musician michaela melian has raised questions like these .
the project is a digital memorial to the victims of national socialism in the bavarian capital .
it draws on archival and audio footage relating to the holocaust and can be accessed online in both german and english .
melian 's project arose from a juried competition in munich seeking new forms of remembrance for nazi victims .
the event was meant to address a city monument that had become obscure due to increasing car traffic nearby .
" memory loops analyzes the most varied historical dimensions by focusing on certain crystallization points in the city of munich .
using archival material and contemporary witness statements , melian artistically shapes voice-collages of the highest quality , " noted the jury .
but the idea also had detractors , including munich 's mayor , christian ude .
he reacted to melian 's proposal in 2008 by wondering whether " its means can be used to achieve an appropriate memorial . "
young voices two years later , the project has been opened and is accessible online as of late september 2010 -lrb- see the link to memory loops below -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michaela melian wanted the memory loops project to appeal to young audiences melian drew from newspapers and holocaust archives and conducted interviews personally to accumulate the material for the project .
then she sought out actors - especially children and other young voices - to speak and record the accounts she found .
" i really wanted the files to sound like young people , " explained melian .
" many victims were young when they left the camps or returned from russia . "
the stories reflect their daily struggles and the nazi regime 's gradual expansion of control over their lives .
one victim 's account is tagged to the address sonnenstrasse 116 , just beyond the city center : " once , there was an air raid warning as i was out in town and wearing the star .
i wanted to go down into a shelter nearby , but they did n't let the jew boy in .
the old botanical garden is a stone 's throw away .
i hid under a shrub and cried - bombs were falling left and right . "
atmospheric music the short audio files are linked to a map indicating where each scene actually occurred .
michaela melian composed the music that accompanies many of their statements , taking inspiration from jewish musicians and composers who collided with nazi ideology during that period .
" karl amadeus hartmann was forbidden from working back then , coco schumann was prevented from performing , and mendelssohn-bartholdy could only be performed by jewish musicians for jewish audiences , " said melian .
" those are facets of the story that i wanted to include in the audio files in a subliminal way . "
a city-wide memorial at the memory loops homepage , visitors can click on 175 blue circles in the english version - and 300 in the german edition - to hear the stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project is also available as an audio guide for mobile phones the project is also being supported by broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk and will be presented as a series of radio programs .
some munich museums are lending their support as well by making mp3 players available with which people can tour the city and hear the stories as they go .
a similar version in english can be downloaded and installed on smart phones .
memory loops is , then , a kind of monument that is spread out across the city .
" i wanted to use the media that occupy nearly all of young people 's free time as well as their working lives : the internet and cell phones .
these days , many young people spend more time on the internet than at any social or public places , " melian said .
intimate glimpses into history munich was a center of activity for the nazi party .
that 's why the city is particularly revealing for those who want to understand the forms of persecution to which nazi victims were subjected and what their lives were like .
" in 1935 , we had to leave the apartment and moved to a cheap and dark ground-floor apartment on trogerstrasse -lsb- troger street -rsb- .
it was very close to where hitler lived .
coming home from church once , we saw him in an open mercedes .
my father said to us , ' a little bomb would be just the thing here , " ' recalls one voice in the memory loops project .
it continues , " we lived extremely modestly .
the other boys at school had it pretty good at home - suddenly , their families had jobs and work , and of course their children were all in the hitler youth .
i had to keep quiet about how things were at home with me . "

its creator , michaela melian , wanted to forge a memorial that would draw the attention of young people and pervade the city . what are memorials , and is it important that they occupy public space ?
certainly they 're a call to remembrance and reflection , but does a " digital memorial " leave out something important by letting people choose when they observe it ?
in munich , an audio map titled memory loops by artist and musician michaela melian has raised questions like these .
the project is a digital memorial to the victims of national socialism in the bavarian capital .
it draws on archival and audio footage relating to the holocaust and can be accessed online in both german and english .
melian 's project arose from a juried competition in munich seeking new forms of remembrance for nazi victims .
the event was meant to address a city monument that had become obscure due to increasing car traffic nearby .
" memory loops analyzes the most varied historical dimensions by focusing on certain crystallization points in the city of munich .
using archival material and contemporary witness statements , melian artistically shapes voice-collages of the highest quality , " noted the jury .
but the idea also had detractors , including munich 's mayor , christian ude .
he reacted to melian 's proposal in 2008 by wondering whether " its means can be used to achieve an appropriate memorial . "
young voices two years later , the project has been opened and is accessible online as of late september 2010 -lrb- see the link to memory loops below -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michaela melian wanted the memory loops project to appeal to young audiences melian drew from newspapers and holocaust archives and conducted interviews personally to accumulate the material for the project .
then she sought out actors - especially children and other young voices - to speak and record the accounts she found .
" i really wanted the files to sound like young people , " explained melian .
" many victims were young when they left the camps or returned from russia . "
the stories reflect their daily struggles and the nazi regime 's gradual expansion of control over their lives .
one victim 's account is tagged to the address sonnenstrasse 116 , just beyond the city center : " once , there was an air raid warning as i was out in town and wearing the star .
i wanted to go down into a shelter nearby , but they did n't let the jew boy in .
the old botanical garden is a stone 's throw away .
i hid under a shrub and cried - bombs were falling left and right . "
atmospheric music the short audio files are linked to a map indicating where each scene actually occurred .
michaela melian composed the music that accompanies many of their statements , taking inspiration from jewish musicians and composers who collided with nazi ideology during that period .
" karl amadeus hartmann was forbidden from working back then , coco schumann was prevented from performing , and mendelssohn-bartholdy could only be performed by jewish musicians for jewish audiences , " said melian .
" those are facets of the story that i wanted to include in the audio files in a subliminal way . "
a city-wide memorial at the memory loops homepage , visitors can click on 175 blue circles in the english version - and 300 in the german edition - to hear the stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project is also available as an audio guide for mobile phones the project is also being supported by broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk and will be presented as a series of radio programs .
some munich museums are lending their support as well by making mp3 players available with which people can tour the city and hear the stories as they go .
a similar version in english can be downloaded and installed on smart phones .
memory loops is , then , a kind of monument that is spread out across the city .
" i wanted to use the media that occupy nearly all of young people 's free time as well as their working lives : the internet and cell phones .
these days , many young people spend more time on the internet than at any social or public places , " melian said .
intimate glimpses into history munich was a center of activity for the nazi party .
that 's why the city is particularly revealing for those who want to understand the forms of persecution to which nazi victims were subjected and what their lives were like .
" in 1935 , we had to leave the apartment and moved to a cheap and dark ground-floor apartment on trogerstrasse -lsb- troger street -rsb- .
it was very close to where hitler lived .
coming home from church once , we saw him in an open mercedes .
my father said to us , ' a little bomb would be just the thing here , " ' recalls one voice in the memory loops project .
it continues , " we lived extremely modestly .
the other boys at school had it pretty good at home - suddenly , their families had jobs and work , and of course their children were all in the hitler youth .
i had to keep quiet about how things were at home with me . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 12.10.2010 un security council is a perennial bone of contention among nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council meets in the norwegian room in the un 's new york headquarters on paper , it ’ s the military command center and thus the most powerful body within the united nations .
but for various reasons the un security council has seldom functioned as it was intended .
history shows why . the security council , like the united nations itself , is a child of world war ii .
the decision to form the council was the centerpiece of the dumbarton oaks conference near washington in 1944 , at which the un was founded .
the idea was to create a body that , once nazi germany had been defeated , would allow the most powerful of the allied nations to act as one and prevent any similar acts of aggression .
" they were quite serious about it being a military command center , " david bosco , assistant professor of political science at american university and the author of a book on the security council , told deutsche welle .
" it was supposed to have what they called a military staff committee and countries were supposed to designate armed forces that would be used by the security council . "
by the time of the yalta conference in 1945 , the structure of institution was formalized and the five permanent members - the us , britain , france , china and the soviet union - were given the power of veto .
the so-called big three - the us , britain and the soviet union - insisted on this provision over the objections of the smaller of the 50 nations that joined the un .
the veto was intended to prevent the council from ever being used against its founding members .
but it also meant that all substantive decisions had to be unanimous , a situation that proved immediately problematic .
' no ' votes and empty seats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the details were finalized at a meeting between churchill , roosevelt and stalin in 1945 after world war ii , with the united states and the soviet union no longer allies but rivals , the divergent interests with the council were all too apparent .
the institution was only a month old when the soviet union exercised its veto power for the first time .
in the first 10 years of its existence , the soviet union vetoed 79 resolutions .
by january 1950 , the soviets were officially boycotting the council to protest the fact that china 's seat was occupied by the republic of china -lrb- today 's taiwan -rrb- rather than the communist people 's republic , which had emerged from the chinese civil war the proceeding year .
ironically , the soviet union 's " empty seat " policy allowed the council to show for the first time that it could act effectively .
" the security council was able to do relatively little in its first couple decades of operation , " bosco said .
" the exception was the korean war when the soviets were boycotting the council .
because they were boycotting , when the korean war broke out , the united states , the united kingdom and france were able to use the security council to push through resolutions condemning the -lsb- north korean -rsb- invasion of south korea and creating a un command to respond to that aggression . "
the un sent troops to korea on september 15 , 1950 and succeeded in pushing communist troops back to the north .
an armistice , which remains in force today , was agreed in 1953 .
the end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers , in their trademark blue helmets , were deployed most often in the 1990s american and soviet interests rarely coincided in the decades that followed , and with very few exceptions , such as the wars in the middle east in the 1960s and ' 70s , the council 's effectiveness was limited .
more often than not , as was the case with the cuban missile crisis , the institution was a stage for heated confrontations between the us and the soviet union .
that changed when mikhail gorbachev became soviet premier in 1985 .
at the time , one of the world 's most pressing security issues was the iran-iraq war .
" at a certain point , the permanent members decided to start having very quiet meetings amongst themselves to try to figure out a way to resolve that conflict , " bosco said .
the end of the cold war and the subsequent collapse of the soviet union broke through many of the ideological loggerheads and ushered in the council 's most productive period .
the council authorized un troops to drive iraqi forces from kuwait in 1990 , and the success of that operation inspired further missions .
" the activity of the council really peaks in 1993-1994 , when the council was passing dozens of resolutions - in the balkans , somalia , rwanda , just a lot of activity , " bosco explained .
" since that period there 's been a little of a retreat and some periods of lesser activity , but it 's never gone back to the -lsb- low -rsb- levels of the cold war . "
new dividing lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us secretary of state powell was unable to pursuade the council in 2003 the bolstered reputation that came with the increased effectiveness of the council took a serious knock in 2003 , when the us , unable to convince all of the permanent members to go to war against iraq , put together a " coalition of the willing " to topple iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
washington 's military-diplomatic run around the council reinforced stereotypes of the un as an impotent debating club rather than a global governing institution .
today , the us exercises its veto more often than any of the other permanent members .
the exclusive privileges of the permanent members also remain a perennial target for critics , who feel that the council 's structure no longer reflects the realities of power around the world .
some larger nations , including india , brazil and germany , have broached the idea that more permanent members should be added .
but for better or worse , the council remains the world 's premier global peacekeeping body .
and despite its inability to bring resolution to issues such as iran 's nuclear program , experts say its actions do have an effect .
" other countries are watching what 's happening with iran , watching it be isolated and its economy suffer , " bosco said .
" and they 're thinking : maybe we do n't want to go through that . "
fifty-five years on from its founding , the united nations security council still does n't function the way it was originally envisioned , but it does seem to be heading , however tentatively , in the right direction .

the two-day conference is being held in the romanian capital , bucharest . european union officials , romanian politicians and roma representatives are discussing integration issues regarding europe 's roma population at a two-day eu conference held in romania 's capital , bucharest .
the conference is aimed at finding solutions on how to achieve more with the money spent by the european union on integrating roma , said the european commissioner for employment and social affairs , laszlo andor , at the opening of the conference .
" a lot has been done in terms of strategic planning , coordination and implementation , but at the end of the day , not much has really changed . " he said .
andor wants eu member states to become more engaged in integrating their roma population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " not much has really changed " - andor said at the conference " the eu can not solve the multi-layered problems of the roma by itself , " he said .
" the european union is ready to step up its efforts for roma integration , but that is also what we expect from all member states . "
funding is available , yet few members take the money even though the european union has funds available , member states refrain from using the money .
from 2007 until 2013 , the european social fund offered 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.1 billion -rrb- to help finance education and housing projects for roma .
especially countries with a high number of roma population like hungary , bulgaria and romania were expected make use of the funds .
the eu has installed a task force in order to find out why member states do not act even though the funds are available .
the task force is expected to present its results by the end of this year .
hungarian prime minister viktor orban said that the integration of roma would be one of the main focuses in hungary 's term in the eu presidency beginning in january .
according to andor , france 's drastic measures of expelling thousands of roma were " very unfortunate " , but " ironically energized the discussions on roma inclusion . "
problem of roma integration will not affect schengen talks german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting romanian prime minister emil boc that the problem of roma integration would not affect negotiations on romania becoming part of the schengen zone .
being a country within the schengen treaty would give romanian citizen visa-free travel within the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a long way from the end of the road , " - according to chancellor merkel merkel said that germany would judge romania 's development on their way to the schengen treaty fairly - but did not promise a quick entrance to the schengen zone .
" the reforms of the judiciary and of interior affairs are being tackled very courageously , but you are still a long way from the end of the road , " merkel said . " we back romania 's efforts to join the schengen zone ... but we must make sure that visa delivery procedures are not marred by corruption , " she said .
it is crucial that romania only issue visas without signs of corruption or unregularities and that eu 's external borders are safe .
" there are no reasonable alternatives to transparent and clear legal terms . " romania is hoping to enter the schengen zone in the middle of 2011 .
the country has been a member of the eu since 2007 .
most of europe 's roma are said to live in romania , but there are no reliable numbers - with figures ranging from a population of 530,000 up to 2.5 million .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 12.10.2010 european commission to push member states to do more to help roma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has deported thousands of roma to romania this summer starting tuesday , romania is hosting a two-day conference of european nations to discuss how to help integrate roma travelers .
europe 's social affairs commissioner said financial help is available to member states . the european commission will once again push member states to do more to improve the situation for roma travelers on tuesday at a conference in bucharest .
the meeting was organized after the french government began its deportations of roma families over the summer , drawing international criticism .
the bucharest conference aims to promote the better use of eu funds to improve the socio-economic situation of the 10 to 12 million roma living on the continent .
they face discrimination , poverty , segregation , and barriers to education and the labor market in many of the european countries in which they settle .
in slovakia , for example , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education .
in bulgaria , over 50 percent of roma are unemployed .
in romania only about a quarter of roma have a steady job .
european funds are under-used in recent years the european union has brought in a comprehensive financial program to promote the integration of the roma and sinti travelers .
but romania and bulgaria , the eu member states with the biggest roma communities , have made little use of the subsidies .
despite the high-profile debate about integration of roma sparked by france 's crackdown on its traveling community , the european union 's commissioner for social affairs and inclusion complained recently that few nations are drawing on the available financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laszlo andor wants countries to make better use of european funds " i would like to stress that this is the responsibility of the european union and the member states together , " andor said in the european parliament .
" the structural funds offer a very useful financial lever for supporting national efforts to improve the situation of the roma .
however , eu funds are often not fully used , or not used in the most effective way . "
currently romania is only using 1 percent of the 2.25 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- made available by the european social fund between 2007 and 2013 to improve the situation of vulnerable groups .
bulgaria is only using 5 percent of the fund .
integration is not just about money however , there is of course no compulsion to use the money .
the german conservative mep manfred weber hopes there is enough incentive for countries to apply for the money if they need it .
" the decisive factor in integration of course is always that it ca n't be proscribed from above , rather it 's got to happen in the towns , in the communities themselves , " weber told deutsche welle .
" it demands creativity . "
the european commission has set up a working group to assess why the roma struggle so much with integration .
the group will deliver its findings by the end of the year .
in the meantime andor wants member states to set ambitious targets for tackling poverty and improving the educational horizons of the roma .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in slovakia , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education " it 's only about poverty reduction , it 's not only about social inclusion , " the commissioner said .
" we have to ensure that the roma are explicitly mentioned in our new employment flagship initiative , because that 's also where a breakthrough has to be made . "
manfred weber believes governments have to tackle the root of the problem by targeting education .
“ we have to follow through the idea that children of this ethnic minority must attend school .
only then can we succeed in truly integrating these travelling families into european societies . ”
the problems for the roma in europe are not new .
there is money available in europe to tackle it .
but it has taken the row over the policy of deporting roma from france to bring this much-beleaguered community into the spotlight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 12.10.2010 militant islam gains ground in the balkans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's feared that some muslim charities could encourage wahhabism a recent online music video featuring macedonians praising osama bin laden has fueled fears that southeastern europe could be emerging as the latest breeding ground for homegrown islamist militants . it has also focused attention on muslim charities active in bosnia , kosovo , serbia , albania , macedonia and european union member bulgaria since the wars in former yugoslavia in the mid-1990s .
many of those charities are funded by oil-rich saudi arabia and propagate wahhabism - the kingdom 's austere and puritan interpretation of islam .
a majority of wahhabis favor peaceful proselytizing of islam while saudi king abdullah has been seeking to soften wahhabi practices as part of his reforms in the kingdom .
militant groups such as osama bin laden 's al-qaeda , the taliban and jihadists in somalia have however embraced significant elements of wahhabism as part of their ideology .
jasmin merdan , a young bosnian who wrote a book after disassociating himself from wahhabis groups in bosnia , warned that " they express their convictions with violence , introduce anarchy in mosques and preach intolerance . " women in the albanian city of skadar have reportedly started covering their heads or wearing the niqab , a full body covering that hides everything but the eyes , in newly found religiosity .
the video posted on youtube is one of several produced by home grown jihadists in the balkans and circulating in the region .
" oh osama , annihilate the american army .
oh osama , raise the muslims ’ honor , " a group of macedonian men chant in albanian on the video .
" in september 2001 you conquered a power .
we all pray for you . "
similar songs calling on southeastern european muslims to join the jihad have been produced in bosnian .
governments and security forces fear that that increased wahhabi activity will produce committed jihadis that could destabilize already fragile nations in southeastern europe and , in the case of bulgaria - where one sixth of the country 's 7.6 million people is muslim - produce a pool of jihadists whose eu passports would grant them easy access to western europe and allow them to blend into society . bulgaria seen as potential breeding ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most bulgarian muslims are of turkish ethnicity bulgaria is the only eu member whose muslim population are not recent immigrants .
most bulgarian muslims like those elsewhere in the balkans are descendants of ethnic turks who arrived during five centuries of ottoman rule .
three ethnic albanian brothers from macedonia were convicted to life in prison in 2008 on charges of plotting to attack the us army 's fort dix military base in new jersey .
a fourth member of the group from kosovo was sentenced to five years in jail .
across the balkans , minority wahhabi groups seek to convert mainstream islam to their more militant interpretation through the operation of cultural centers , mosques , schools and at times by battling for control of majority muslim organizations and community-owned property .
a majority of the region 's muslims are secular and analysts caution against overstating the wahhabi threat .
" it should not be ignored , but neither should it be exaggerated , " said hajrudin somun a former bosnian ambassador to turkey and history professor at sarajevo 's philip noel-baker international university .
the analysts say militant islam is gaining ground on the fringe of a more general return to religion in the balkans .
several thousand orthodox christian bulgarians demonstrated in sofia recently demanding that religious instruction be made compulsory in schools - a demand supported by mainstream muslim organizations .
muslim organizations are believed to have spent large amounts of money over the last decade to build some 150 new mosques and educational centers in predominantly orthodox bulgaria .
a minority are believed to promote wahhabism .
analysts say that radical islam has gained ground in southern and northeastern bulgaria where militant islamists , according to former bulgarian chief mufti nedim gendzhev , are seeking to create a " fundamentalist triangle " in areas of bosnia , macedonia and bulgaria 's western rhodope mountains .
fears of increasing radicalism bulgarian authorities last year arrested a mayor and a village teacher in the south of the country on charges of preaching radical islam .
in 2003 , authorities shut down several islamic centers because they were financed by saudi-funded muslim groups believed to have links to militant islamic organizations and " to prevent terrorists getting a foothold in bulgaria . "
some analysts estimate that 3,000 young muslims have graduated from militant schools still operating in bulgaria ; it was not immediately clear what they went on to do following their graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations are tense between muslims and serbs in bosnia the threat posed by the wahhabis is a major bone of contention in tense relations between muslims and serbs in bosnia , which so far has successfully neutralized wahhabi influence by controlling the appointment of imams in mosques and teachers at islamic educational institutions and employing law enforcement .
some bosnian wahhabis , estimated to number 3,000 , are former foreign fighters who married bosnian women and stayed in the country after the bosnian war that ended in 1995 .
bosnia recently stepped up its fight against militancy and organized crime to meet an eu requirement for visa-free travel for bosnians and closer ties with the bloc .
in early september , bosnian police uncovered a cache of weapons and detained a third suspect as part of their inquiry into a june bomb attack that killed one policeman and injured six others .
the attack on a police station in the town of bugojno was one of the most serious security incidents in bosnia .
police arrested the suspected mastermind and an aide shortly after the blast .
bosnia tries to crackdown on militants boris grubesic , a spokesman for the bosnian prosecutor 's office , told reporters in mid-september that prosecutors were investigating several people from bugojno and gornja maoca on suspicion of wahhabi ties , terrorism and human trafficking .
in february , bosnian and eu police raided gornja maoca and arrested seven men described as wahhabis because of their beards and shortened trousers .
police said they were detained for suspected illegal possession of arms and threatening the country 's " territorial integrity , constitutional order and provoking inter-ethnic and religious hatred . " gornja maoca was home to some 30 families who lived by strict shariah laws , organized schooling in arabic for their children outside the state system and opposed the primacy of bosnia 's mainstream islamic community .
nusret imamovic , the town 's self-proclaimed wahhabi leader , endorsed suicide attacks on the group 's bosnian language website , saying they should be launched only in " exceptional circumstances . "
the site features statements by al-qaeda and islamic groups fighting in the caucasus and celebrates suicide bombers as joyful muslims .
serbian officials say 12 alleged wahhabis convicted last year to prison terms of up to 13 years for planning terrorist attacks , including on the us embassy in belgrade , had close ties to their brethren in gornja maoca .
one of the convicted , adnan hot , said during the trial that imamovic was one of only three muslim leaders that he followed .
four other wahhabis were sentenced in a separate case to jail terms of up to eight years on charges of planning to bomb a football stadium in the southern serbian town of novi pazar .
in macedonia , suleyman rexhepim rexhepi , head of the official islamic religious community -lrb- ivz -rrb- , recently called on the government and the international community to crack down on increasingly influential wahabbi groups .
rexhepi is locked into a bitter battle with ramadan ramadani , the imam of the isa beg mosque in skopje , that has caused a rift in the country 's muslim community .
ramadani accuses rexhep of financial msmangement and is seeking his ouster .
he organized a petition signed by thousands of his followers supporting his bid for leadership of the community after rexhepi banned him from organizing prayers .
ramadani denies that wahhabis are active among macedonian muslims who account for roughly one quarter of the population as well as allegations that the pro-bin laden music video was played in mosques he controls .
a ramadani associate , radical kosovo imam sefket krasnici , shocked macedonians , when he recently denounced mother teresa , a native of skopje whom many consider a saint , during a sermon in the macedonian capital .
" she belongs in the middle of hell because she did not believe in allah , the prophet and the koran ...
even if she believed in god her belief was incomplete , with deficiencies .
god does not accept such worship , " krasnici said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 12.10.2010 european commission to push member states to do more to help roma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has deported thousands of roma to romania this summer starting tuesday , romania is hosting a two-day conference of european nations to discuss how to help integrate roma travelers .
europe 's social affairs commissioner said financial help is available to member states . the european commission will once again push member states to do more to improve the situation for roma travelers on tuesday at a conference in bucharest .
the meeting was organized after the french government began its deportations of roma families over the summer , drawing international criticism .
the bucharest conference aims to promote the better use of eu funds to improve the socio-economic situation of the 10 to 12 million roma living on the continent .
they face discrimination , poverty , segregation , and barriers to education and the labor market in many of the european countries in which they settle .
in slovakia , for example , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education .
in bulgaria , over 50 percent of roma are unemployed .
in romania only about a quarter of roma have a steady job .
european funds are under-used in recent years the european union has brought in a comprehensive financial program to promote the integration of the roma and sinti travelers .
but romania and bulgaria , the eu member states with the biggest roma communities , have made little use of the subsidies .
despite the high-profile debate about integration of roma sparked by france 's crackdown on its traveling community , the european union 's commissioner for social affairs and inclusion complained recently that few nations are drawing on the available financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laszlo andor wants countries to make better use of european funds " i would like to stress that this is the responsibility of the european union and the member states together , " andor said in the european parliament .
" the structural funds offer a very useful financial lever for supporting national efforts to improve the situation of the roma .
however , eu funds are often not fully used , or not used in the most effective way . "
currently romania is only using 1 percent of the 2.25 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- made available by the european social fund between 2007 and 2013 to improve the situation of vulnerable groups .
bulgaria is only using 5 percent of the fund .
integration is not just about money however , there is of course no compulsion to use the money .
the german conservative mep manfred weber hopes there is enough incentive for countries to apply for the money if they need it .
" the decisive factor in integration of course is always that it ca n't be proscribed from above , rather it 's got to happen in the towns , in the communities themselves , " weber told deutsche welle .
" it demands creativity . "
the european commission has set up a working group to assess why the roma struggle so much with integration .
the group will deliver its findings by the end of the year .
in the meantime andor wants member states to set ambitious targets for tackling poverty and improving the educational horizons of the roma .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in slovakia , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education " it 's only about poverty reduction , it 's not only about social inclusion , " the commissioner said .
" we have to ensure that the roma are explicitly mentioned in our new employment flagship initiative , because that 's also where a breakthrough has to be made . "
manfred weber believes governments have to tackle the root of the problem by targeting education .
“ we have to follow through the idea that children of this ethnic minority must attend school .
only then can we succeed in truly integrating these travelling families into european societies . ”
the problems for the roma in europe are not new .
there is money available in europe to tackle it .
but it has taken the row over the policy of deporting roma from france to bring this much-beleaguered community into the spotlight .

but not all germans are happy that their homes , cars and even themselves could be online for all to see . some 1 million germans make use of the street view service daily for a virtual ground 's eye look of the world , according to google .
but the company has been heavily criticized in germany as it gets ready to put maps of german cities online , which the company plans to do by the end of the year .
much of that criticism has come from the southern german state of bavaria , and the region around the city of ingolstadt in particular .
" the problem with google street view is that google - without asking - has gone and photographed german houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used , " georg schaeff , the publisher of the ingolstadt-based daily donaukurier , told deutsche welle .
the newspaper has publicized local opposition to the service for the last two years .
that 's a problem in germany since the country 's highest court has affirmed citizens ' rights to control who has their personal information and how it 's used .
google gives ground " we take privacy very seriously , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service . "
the california tech giant has made concessions to german privacy advocates by allowing material to be made unrecognizable before being published , which it has n't done in the other 23 countries street view is online .
furthermore , after facing widespread criticism , it doubled the opt-out period to eight weeks , which ends on friday .
some 200,000 people have taken google up on the offer to have their homes or apartment building blurred , according to a report in the german news magazine der spiegel .
google , which automatically blurs the faces and vehicle license plates its computer can recognize and asks users to point out the ones it misses , has not commented on the number of opt-out it has received .
bildunterschrift : some 200,000 people have removed themselves from street view , a german magazine reported but schaeff said people have no way of making sure what they see as a violation of their privacy really gets deleted .
he added that citizens have little recourse if google does n't agree with their claim of a privacy infringement by the panoramic photos of whatever is visible from the street taken by the eight cameras mounted on the company 's car .
" individual citizens ca n't assert themselves against these kinds of companies , " he said .
" and the corporations do n't bother to consider if what they are doing is illegal or not .
google works on the premise of ' why ask for permission when you can beg for forgiveness after the fact ? " '
privacy rift but privacy advocates still have a lot of convincing to do .
some 41 percent of germans see more positive than negative aspects to street view and 16 percent say they have or will remove their homes from the service , according to an august study by the emnid research institute .
many ingolstadt locals agreed with the poll 's sentiment .
" google can go ahead and do it , because everyone leaves their tracks all over the internet and everywhere else , " said ingo zingel , an ingolstadt resident .
" whether someone takes a picture of the door to my house really does n't matter . "
schaeff said he 's not surprised that some people do n't seem concerned about what 's happening to their personal information .
" i think there is a rift in society where half the people do n't see a problem and do n't know what 's coming down the road , " he said .
" the other half is much more sensitive and is more careful because the situation is far from clear . "
what 's unclear , he added , is how images from street view - or any other type of geodata , such as that collected by mobile phone providers - can be used to create profiles of individuals that are later sold to third parties .
without knowing how personal data will be used , he said people should give out as little as possible .
" each piece of personal information is like a stone that creates a mosaic , " schaeff said .
" every little stone plays a meaningful role , but , unfortunately , you ca n't tell what the role is until the whole picture has been made . "
' sensible areas ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 41 percent germans said street view has more positive than negative aspects but there are some pictures thomas herker , the mayor of pfaffenhofen , just south of ingolstadt , said he knows he does n't want made .
while he insisted that city hall and pubic offices be visible in street view , he added that some public buildings should be unrecognizable on the internet .
" we requested that google remove public kindergartens and schools , " he said referring to a letter the city sent in december 2009 to google 's german headquarters in hamburg .
" two weeks ago we were told they would not do it because only private individuals - not municipalities - have a right to remove property . "
herker led a group of bavarian mayors which sent another request to google asking for the company to respect their wishes and remove kindergartens and other " sensible areas " from street view .
while herker is left hoping google accounts for his city 's wishes , the point may become moot if the service goes online as planned by the end of the year .
the last time herker wrote to google it took 10 months to get a form letter response .
if it takes that long again the pictures will have long been online for all to see .
" there are three companies in germany that , in my opinion , are problematic : deutsche telekom , deutsche bahn , and now i 've added google to the list , " he said .
" i can only hope that google will change its mind and make it possible to remove public property from the service . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 12.10.2010 turkish eu affairs minister tells turkish germans to integrate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagis told turkish germans to accept german customs days after the leaders of germany and turkey pledged to cooperate more on the integration of germany 's substantial turkish minority , a turkish politician tells turkish germans integration is a responsibility . turkish european union affairs minister egemen bagis has called on turks in germany to better integrate themselves into german culture , inserting himself into a fierce and ongoing debate on the integration of germany 's turkish minority .
" learn german !
adjust to the customs of your host country , " he told daily newspaper bild in an interview published on tuesday .
" you do n't have to give up the gift of your identity and culture , but rather think of yourselves as ambassadors for turkey .
only then can you build bridges for a better friendship and partnership between our countries . "
three days before his comments were published , german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan met in berlin on the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between the two countries , pledging to cooperate more on integration of turks living in germany .
multi-faceted integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to work together on integration ines michalowski , a senior researcher at berlin 's social science research center , said the call for turkish-germans to maintain their culture while still adjusting to german customs may seem paradoxical , but that the two are not mutually exclusive .
" the turkish nation-state is a very nationalistic nation , where there are actually claims of turks belonging to the turkish nation-state even though they have been living abroad for several generations , " she told deutsche welle .
" but that does n't mean that integration on the labor market , or in the educational system , or contacts with germans - that these aspects of integration go badly . "
still , research shows that most turkish germans are poorly integrated in these areas - a fact which haci halil uslucan , director of the center for turkish studies and integration research , said can not be entirely attributed to a perceived lack of motivation of immigrants to integrate themselves .
" i think we also have to focus on the conditions of being integrated - and that means the attitudes of the majority , the look of the majority on the minority , " he told deutsche welle .
" the political discussion should not go in this direction of creating ranks - these are the good immigrants and these are the bad ones .
that only increases social tension . "
education is key bagis also said in his interview that turkish-german parents should send their children " to the best schools , so that they have a future , " echoing comments by prime minister erdogan that turkish-germans should prioritize education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research shows other minorities have integrated better than turks michalowski said studies of vietnamese immigrant parents in the eastern state of brandenburg have shown their children to have higher high-school graduation and college entrance rates than non-immigrant german children , partly because the parents place a high priority on education .
" some of the criticism has been that maybe turkish parents are not putting enough emphasis on getting a good education within germany , " she said .
" so if there is a government official from turkey who actually encourages people to pay more attention to the education of their children , i think that can never do any harm . "
but uslucan said other research shows that turkish-german parents have high educational aspirations for their children , and that teachers often send young turkish students to lower-level high schools that do not feed into universities , even when their educational performance is as good as their non-turkish peers .
" the doctrine must be that turkish parents should have more information about the german educational system , " he said .
" i think there is the problem that turkish parents do n't have enough information on what the best school is . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has made entry into the eu a high priority ambassadors for turkish eu accession in addition to his post as eu affairs minister , bagis is also chiefly responsible for negotiating turkey 's accession into the bloc .
while merkel has called turkey 's accession process " open-ended with no guarantees , " the turkish government has made it a high priority .
michalowski said bagis 's call on immigrants to integrate could be seen as a way of enhancing turkey 's chances of gaining eu membership .
" if you have a well-integrated minority , people in germany may be more favorable to the idea of turkey becoming a member of the european union than if the turkish community is always in the media as being badly integrated , " she said .

but not all germans are happy that their homes , cars and even themselves could be online for all to see . some 1 million germans make use of the street view service daily for a virtual ground 's eye look of the world , according to google .
but the company has been heavily criticized in germany as it gets ready to put maps of german cities online , which the company plans to do by the end of the year .
much of that criticism has come from the southern german state of bavaria , and the region around the city of ingolstadt in particular .
" the problem with google street view is that google - without asking - has gone and photographed german houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used , " georg schaeff , the publisher of the ingolstadt-based daily donaukurier , told deutsche welle .
the newspaper has publicized local opposition to the service for the last two years .
that 's a problem in germany since the country 's highest court has affirmed citizens ' rights to control who has their personal information and how it 's used .
google gives ground " we take privacy very seriously , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service . "
the california tech giant has made concessions to german privacy advocates by allowing material to be made unrecognizable before being published , which it has n't done in the other 23 countries street view is online .
furthermore , after facing widespread criticism , it doubled the opt-out period to eight weeks , which ends on friday .
some 200,000 people have taken google up on the offer to have their homes or apartment building blurred , according to a report in the german news magazine der spiegel .
google , which automatically blurs the faces and vehicle license plates its computer can recognize and asks users to point out the ones it misses , has not commented on the number of opt-out it has received .
bildunterschrift : some 200,000 people have removed themselves from street view , a german magazine reported but schaeff said people have no way of making sure what they see as a violation of their privacy really gets deleted .
he added that citizens have little recourse if google does n't agree with their claim of a privacy infringement by the panoramic photos of whatever is visible from the street taken by the eight cameras mounted on the company 's car .
" individual citizens ca n't assert themselves against these kinds of companies , " he said .
" and the corporations do n't bother to consider if what they are doing is illegal or not .
google works on the premise of ' why ask for permission when you can beg for forgiveness after the fact ? " '
privacy rift but privacy advocates still have a lot of convincing to do .
some 41 percent of germans see more positive than negative aspects to street view and 16 percent say they have or will remove their homes from the service , according to an august study by the emnid research institute .
many ingolstadt locals agreed with the poll 's sentiment .
" google can go ahead and do it , because everyone leaves their tracks all over the internet and everywhere else , " said ingo zingel , an ingolstadt resident .
" whether someone takes a picture of the door to my house really does n't matter . "
schaeff said he 's not surprised that some people do n't seem concerned about what 's happening to their personal information .
" i think there is a rift in society where half the people do n't see a problem and do n't know what 's coming down the road , " he said .
" the other half is much more sensitive and is more careful because the situation is far from clear . "
what 's unclear , he added , is how images from street view - or any other type of geodata , such as that collected by mobile phone providers - can be used to create profiles of individuals that are later sold to third parties .
without knowing how personal data will be used , he said people should give out as little as possible .
" each piece of personal information is like a stone that creates a mosaic , " schaeff said .
" every little stone plays a meaningful role , but , unfortunately , you ca n't tell what the role is until the whole picture has been made . "
' sensible areas ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 41 percent germans said street view has more positive than negative aspects but there are some pictures thomas herker , the mayor of pfaffenhofen , just south of ingolstadt , said he knows he does n't want made .
while he insisted that city hall and pubic offices be visible in street view , he added that some public buildings should be unrecognizable on the internet .
" we requested that google remove public kindergartens and schools , " he said referring to a letter the city sent in december 2009 to google 's german headquarters in hamburg .
" two weeks ago we were told they would not do it because only private individuals - not municipalities - have a right to remove property . "
herker led a group of bavarian mayors which sent another request to google asking for the company to respect their wishes and remove kindergartens and other " sensible areas " from street view .
while herker is left hoping google accounts for his city 's wishes , the point may become moot if the service goes online as planned by the end of the year .
the last time herker wrote to google it took 10 months to get a form letter response .
if it takes that long again the pictures will have long been online for all to see .
" there are three companies in germany that , in my opinion , are problematic : deutsche telekom , deutsche bahn , and now i 've added google to the list , " he said .
" i can only hope that google will change its mind and make it possible to remove public property from the service . "

the two-day conference is being held in the romanian capital , bucharest . european union officials , romanian politicians and roma representatives are discussing integration issues regarding europe 's roma population at a two-day eu conference held in romania 's capital , bucharest .
the conference is aimed at finding solutions on how to achieve more with the money spent by the european union on integrating roma , said the european commissioner for employment and social affairs , laszlo andor , at the opening of the conference .
" a lot has been done in terms of strategic planning , coordination and implementation , but at the end of the day , not much has really changed . " he said .
andor wants eu member states to become more engaged in integrating their roma population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " not much has really changed " - andor said at the conference " the eu can not solve the multi-layered problems of the roma by itself , " he said .
" the european union is ready to step up its efforts for roma integration , but that is also what we expect from all member states . "
funding is available , yet few members take the money even though the european union has funds available , member states refrain from using the money .
from 2007 until 2013 , the european social fund offered 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.1 billion -rrb- to help finance education and housing projects for roma .
especially countries with a high number of roma population like hungary , bulgaria and romania were expected make use of the funds .
the eu has installed a task force in order to find out why member states do not act even though the funds are available .
the task force is expected to present its results by the end of this year .
hungarian prime minister viktor orban said that the integration of roma would be one of the main focuses in hungary 's term in the eu presidency beginning in january .
according to andor , france 's drastic measures of expelling thousands of roma were " very unfortunate " , but " ironically energized the discussions on roma inclusion . "
problem of roma integration will not affect schengen talks german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting romanian prime minister emil boc that the problem of roma integration would not affect negotiations on romania becoming part of the schengen zone .
being a country within the schengen treaty would give romanian citizen visa-free travel within the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a long way from the end of the road , " - according to chancellor merkel merkel said that germany would judge romania 's development on their way to the schengen treaty fairly - but did not promise a quick entrance to the schengen zone .
" the reforms of the judiciary and of interior affairs are being tackled very courageously , but you are still a long way from the end of the road , " merkel said . " we back romania 's efforts to join the schengen zone ... but we must make sure that visa delivery procedures are not marred by corruption , " she said .
it is crucial that romania only issue visas without signs of corruption or unregularities and that eu 's external borders are safe .
" there are no reasonable alternatives to transparent and clear legal terms . " romania is hoping to enter the schengen zone in the middle of 2011 .
the country has been a member of the eu since 2007 .
most of europe 's roma are said to live in romania , but there are no reliable numbers - with figures ranging from a population of 530,000 up to 2.5 million .

from 2007 until 2013 , the european social fund offered 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.1 billion -rrb- to help finance education and housing projects for roma .
especially countries with a high number of roma population like hungary , bulgaria and romania were expected make use of the funds .
the eu has installed a task force in order to find out why member states do not act even though the funds are available .
the task force is expected to present its results by the end of this year .
hungarian prime minister viktor orban said that the integration of roma would be one of the main focuses in hungary 's term in the eu presidency beginning in january .
according to andor , france 's drastic measures of expelling thousands of roma were " very unfortunate " , but " ironically energized the discussions on roma inclusion . "
problem of roma integration will not affect schengen talks german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting romanian prime minister emil boc that the problem of roma integration would not affect negotiations on romania becoming part of the schengen zone .
being a country within the schengen treaty would give romanian citizen visa-free travel within the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a long way from the end of the road , " - according to chancellor merkel merkel said that germany would judge romania 's development on their way to the schengen treaty fairly - but did not promise a quick entrance to the schengen zone .
" the reforms of the judiciary and of interior affairs are being tackled very courageously , but you are still a long way from the end of the road , " merkel said . " we back romania 's efforts to join the schengen zone ... but we must make sure that visa delivery procedures are not marred by corruption , " she said .
it is crucial that romania only issue visas without signs of corruption or unregularities and that eu 's external borders are safe .
" there are no reasonable alternatives to transparent and clear legal terms . " romania is hoping to enter the schengen zone in the middle of 2011 .
the country has been a member of the eu since 2007 .
most of europe 's roma are said to live in romania , but there are no reliable numbers - with figures ranging from a population of 530,000 up to 2.5 million .

" learn german !
adjust to the customs of your host country , " he told daily newspaper bild in an interview published on tuesday .
" you do n't have to give up the gift of your identity and culture , but rather think of yourselves as ambassadors for turkey .
only then can you build bridges for a better friendship and partnership between our countries . "
three days before his comments were published , german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan met in berlin on the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between the two countries , pledging to cooperate more on integration of turks living in germany .
multi-faceted integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to work together on integration ines michalowski , a senior researcher at berlin 's social science research center , said the call for turkish-germans to maintain their culture while still adjusting to german customs may seem paradoxical , but that the two are not mutually exclusive .
" the turkish nation-state is a very nationalistic nation , where there are actually claims of turks belonging to the turkish nation-state even though they have been living abroad for several generations , " she told deutsche welle .
" but that does n't mean that integration on the labor market , or in the educational system , or contacts with germans - that these aspects of integration go badly . "
still , research shows that most turkish germans are poorly integrated in these areas - a fact which haci halil uslucan , director of the center for turkish studies and integration research , said can not be entirely attributed to a perceived lack of motivation of immigrants to integrate themselves .
" i think we also have to focus on the conditions of being integrated - and that means the attitudes of the majority , the look of the majority on the minority , " he told deutsche welle .
" the political discussion should not go in this direction of creating ranks - these are the good immigrants and these are the bad ones .
that only increases social tension . "
education is key bagis also said in his interview that turkish-german parents should send their children " to the best schools , so that they have a future , " echoing comments by prime minister erdogan that turkish-germans should prioritize education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research shows other minorities have integrated better than turks michalowski said studies of vietnamese immigrant parents in the eastern state of brandenburg have shown their children to have higher high-school graduation and college entrance rates than non-immigrant german children , partly because the parents place a high priority on education .
" some of the criticism has been that maybe turkish parents are not putting enough emphasis on getting a good education within germany , " she said .
" so if there is a government official from turkey who actually encourages people to pay more attention to the education of their children , i think that can never do any harm . "
but uslucan said other research shows that turkish-german parents have high educational aspirations for their children , and that teachers often send young turkish students to lower-level high schools that do not feed into universities , even when their educational performance is as good as their non-turkish peers .
" the doctrine must be that turkish parents should have more information about the german educational system , " he said .
" i think there is the problem that turkish parents do n't have enough information on what the best school is . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has made entry into the eu a high priority ambassadors for turkish eu accession in addition to his post as eu affairs minister , bagis is also chiefly responsible for negotiating turkey 's accession into the bloc .
while merkel has called turkey 's accession process " open-ended with no guarantees , " the turkish government has made it a high priority .
michalowski said bagis 's call on immigrants to integrate could be seen as a way of enhancing turkey 's chances of gaining eu membership .
" if you have a well-integrated minority , people in germany may be more favorable to the idea of turkey becoming a member of the european union than if the turkish community is always in the media as being badly integrated , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 12.10.2010 eu searches for answers in roma integration debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some roma have been deported back to romania from france integrating roma in european countries has proven to be difficult , but experts at an eu conference are trying to find solutions .
the two-day conference is being held in the romanian capital , bucharest . european union officials , romanian politicians and roma representatives are discussing integration issues regarding europe 's roma population at a two-day eu conference held in romania 's capital , bucharest .
the conference is aimed at finding solutions on how to achieve more with the money spent by the european union on integrating roma , said the european commissioner for employment and social affairs , laszlo andor , at the opening of the conference .
" a lot has been done in terms of strategic planning , coordination and implementation , but at the end of the day , not much has really changed . " he said .
andor wants eu member states to become more engaged in integrating their roma population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " not much has really changed " - andor said at the conference " the eu can not solve the multi-layered problems of the roma by itself , " he said .
" the european union is ready to step up its efforts for roma integration , but that is also what we expect from all member states . "
funding is available , yet few members take the money even though the european union has funds available , member states refrain from using the money .
from 2007 until 2013 , the european social fund offered 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.1 billion -rrb- to help finance education and housing projects for roma .
especially countries with a high number of roma population like hungary , bulgaria and romania were expected make use of the funds .
the eu has installed a task force in order to find out why member states do not act even though the funds are available .
the task force is expected to present its results by the end of this year .
hungarian prime minister viktor orban said that the integration of roma would be one of the main focuses in hungary 's term in the eu presidency beginning in january .
according to andor , france 's drastic measures of expelling thousands of roma were " very unfortunate " , but " ironically energized the discussions on roma inclusion . "
problem of roma integration will not affect schengen talks german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting romanian prime minister emil boc that the problem of roma integration would not affect negotiations on romania becoming part of the schengen zone .
being a country within the schengen treaty would give romanian citizen visa-free travel within the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a long way from the end of the road , " - according to chancellor merkel merkel said that germany would judge romania 's development on their way to the schengen treaty fairly - but did not promise a quick entrance to the schengen zone .
" the reforms of the judiciary and of interior affairs are being tackled very courageously , but you are still a long way from the end of the road , " merkel said . " we back romania 's efforts to join the schengen zone ... but we must make sure that visa delivery procedures are not marred by corruption , " she said .
it is crucial that romania only issue visas without signs of corruption or unregularities and that eu 's external borders are safe .
" there are no reasonable alternatives to transparent and clear legal terms . " romania is hoping to enter the schengen zone in the middle of 2011 .
the country has been a member of the eu since 2007 .
most of europe 's roma are said to live in romania , but there are no reliable numbers - with figures ranging from a population of 530,000 up to 2.5 million .

but not all germans are happy that their homes , cars and even themselves could be online for all to see . some 1 million germans make use of the street view service daily for a virtual ground 's eye look of the world , according to google .
but the company has been heavily criticized in germany as it gets ready to put maps of german cities online , which the company plans to do by the end of the year .
much of that criticism has come from the southern german state of bavaria , and the region around the city of ingolstadt in particular .
" the problem with google street view is that google - without asking - has gone and photographed german houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used , " georg schaeff , the publisher of the ingolstadt-based daily donaukurier , told deutsche welle .
the newspaper has publicized local opposition to the service for the last two years .
that 's a problem in germany since the country 's highest court has affirmed citizens ' rights to control who has their personal information and how it 's used .
google gives ground " we take privacy very seriously , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service . "
the california tech giant has made concessions to german privacy advocates by allowing material to be made unrecognizable before being published , which it has n't done in the other 23 countries street view is online .
furthermore , after facing widespread criticism , it doubled the opt-out period to eight weeks , which ends on friday .
some 200,000 people have taken google up on the offer to have their homes or apartment building blurred , according to a report in the german news magazine der spiegel .
google , which automatically blurs the faces and vehicle license plates its computer can recognize and asks users to point out the ones it misses , has not commented on the number of opt-out it has received .
bildunterschrift : some 200,000 people have removed themselves from street view , a german magazine reported but schaeff said people have no way of making sure what they see as a violation of their privacy really gets deleted .
he added that citizens have little recourse if google does n't agree with their claim of a privacy infringement by the panoramic photos of whatever is visible from the street taken by the eight cameras mounted on the company 's car .
" individual citizens ca n't assert themselves against these kinds of companies , " he said .
" and the corporations do n't bother to consider if what they are doing is illegal or not .
google works on the premise of ' why ask for permission when you can beg for forgiveness after the fact ? " '
privacy rift but privacy advocates still have a lot of convincing to do .
some 41 percent of germans see more positive than negative aspects to street view and 16 percent say they have or will remove their homes from the service , according to an august study by the emnid research institute .
many ingolstadt locals agreed with the poll 's sentiment .
" google can go ahead and do it , because everyone leaves their tracks all over the internet and everywhere else , " said ingo zingel , an ingolstadt resident .
" whether someone takes a picture of the door to my house really does n't matter . "
schaeff said he 's not surprised that some people do n't seem concerned about what 's happening to their personal information .
" i think there is a rift in society where half the people do n't see a problem and do n't know what 's coming down the road , " he said .
" the other half is much more sensitive and is more careful because the situation is far from clear . "
what 's unclear , he added , is how images from street view - or any other type of geodata , such as that collected by mobile phone providers - can be used to create profiles of individuals that are later sold to third parties .
without knowing how personal data will be used , he said people should give out as little as possible .
" each piece of personal information is like a stone that creates a mosaic , " schaeff said .
" every little stone plays a meaningful role , but , unfortunately , you ca n't tell what the role is until the whole picture has been made . "
' sensible areas ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 41 percent germans said street view has more positive than negative aspects but there are some pictures thomas herker , the mayor of pfaffenhofen , just south of ingolstadt , said he knows he does n't want made .
while he insisted that city hall and pubic offices be visible in street view , he added that some public buildings should be unrecognizable on the internet .
" we requested that google remove public kindergartens and schools , " he said referring to a letter the city sent in december 2009 to google 's german headquarters in hamburg .
" two weeks ago we were told they would not do it because only private individuals - not municipalities - have a right to remove property . "
herker led a group of bavarian mayors which sent another request to google asking for the company to respect their wishes and remove kindergartens and other " sensible areas " from street view .
while herker is left hoping google accounts for his city 's wishes , the point may become moot if the service goes online as planned by the end of the year .
the last time herker wrote to google it took 10 months to get a form letter response .
if it takes that long again the pictures will have long been online for all to see .
" there are three companies in germany that , in my opinion , are problematic : deutsche telekom , deutsche bahn , and now i 've added google to the list , " he said .
" i can only hope that google will change its mind and make it possible to remove public property from the service . "

the kazakhs held die mannschaft for the first 45 minutes of the encounter , but were unable to stem the germans ’ flow of attacking football in the second half .
the first goal came from miroslav klose , who , finding the net for the third time in two games , slotted home three minutes after the break .
substitute mario gomez added a second goal in the 78th minute and lukas podolski put the final touch on the score line five minutes from fulltime .
the victory puts germany at the top of their group on 12 points , five clear of their nearest rival austria , who played out a thrilling 4-4 draw with belgium in tuesday 's late game .
the loss leaves kazakhstan bottom of the group with zero points .
germany coach joachim loew said that he was pleased with the result : " we achieved what we wanted to do , but obviously some errors occurred . "
" we have 12 points .
that is what we wanted , so i have to be satisfied .
what the team managed to achieve this year has been great , i ca n't expect them to be brilliant in every game , " he said .
" we have a lead at the top and that is comfortable , but we still need to win a few games before we can plan for the finals . "
in the third group a game played tuesday , azerbaijan pulled off a shock 1-0 win at home over a much-fancied turkey , who earlier in the week had gone down to germany in berlin .
the euro 2012 championships are to be held in poland and ukraine .

is that right ? bianca keybach : yes , we made a cake for google to welcome them and we put it into our facebook fan page and afterward we sent an invitation to google to say that we would be glad to welcome them here , and then google contacted us and we will see what happens .
when google contacted you , what happened ?
they were thankful for being so positive because this was a very big discussion in germany , -lsb- due to privacy -rsb- and taking pictures and everybody says we do n't want that .
we were one of the towns that said we would like -lsb- street view -rsb- .

i think that it would be an additional service for our guests .

with google street view they can look into the town and discover the street , discover the region and after the holidays they can show their family and friends where they have been and what they can recommend .

have they actually sent a car to oberstaufen ?
they 've been here last year or at the beginning of this year .
they were in oberstaufen .
nobody saw them , though .
they took pictures and they have them and we 'll all waiting if there 's any chance that we can go on street view as soon as possible .
some have argued against street view because they say criminals could use it to plan robberies .
do you think that 's a valid argument ?
that 's a very interesting argument , because it 's one of the most important arguments for the critics but i think it 's crazy because the pictures were taken five or 10 months ago and they will be online for five or 10 years .
but if i want to get into a house and commit a crime , i wo n't use a picture that is many years old .
i could just use a postcard , for example , as a basis for burglary .
i think that 's not very realistic , but it 's very nice for a symbolic discussion .
are you surprised that there have n't been more cities that have welcomed google like oberstaufen has ?
i was not surprised because usually in germany you wait -lsb- to not draw attention to yourself -rsb- .
as long as you 're waiting , nobody is criticizing you .
i think it 's german , and it 's normal that no other towns really said , " we like google and we welcome google and we see a lot of positive aspects in this theme . "
after we said we like google and we support google street view , in our region , other towns and villages said , " we like would like to have them here , but you have to be the pioneer . "
we are glad that we decided to be very open .
now you mentioned earlier that you sent google a cake .
what kind of cake was it ?
i think it was a chocolate cake that was covered in frosting .
we just took a picture of the cake and sent the picture by e-mail , by twitter and we put it on facebook and we sent a real invitation that as soon as they come to take the other pictures of oberstaufen we will welcome them with the original cake .

however , one city in the southern state of bavaria , oberstaufen , has publicly supported google street view - and may be the only city in the country that has supported the company to such a great degree .
in an interview with deutsche welle , bianca keybach , the head of oberstaufen 's tourist office , explained why the city even went so far as to bake for google .
deutsche welle : oberstaufen made a video and even baked a cake for google .
is that right ? bianca keybach : yes , we made a cake for google to welcome them and we put it into our facebook fan page and afterward we sent an invitation to google to say that we would be glad to welcome them here , and then google contacted us and we will see what happens .
when google contacted you , what happened ?
they were thankful for being so positive because this was a very big discussion in germany , -lsb- due to privacy -rsb- and taking pictures and everybody says we do n't want that .
we were one of the towns that said we would like -lsb- street view -rsb- .
tell me why you want google taking street view photographs in your town ?
what do you hope to accomplish other than to show how great the town is ?
i think that it would be an additional service for our guests .
when they are choosing a hotel or reading our brochures or they look at our homepage and they ca n't really say if everything is true , if there is a big street next to the hotel .
with google street view they can look into the town and discover the street , discover the region and after the holidays they can show their family and friends where they have been and what they can recommend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bianca keybach is the head of oberstaufen 's tourism office google has sent out their street view vehicles to big cities around germany , and they 're going to be releasing the photos for the 20 biggest cities around germany later this year .
have they actually sent a car to oberstaufen ?
they 've been here last year or at the beginning of this year .
they were in oberstaufen .
nobody saw them , though .
they took pictures and they have them and we 'll all waiting if there 's any chance that we can go on street view as soon as possible .
some have argued against street view because they say criminals could use it to plan robberies .
do you think that 's a valid argument ?
that 's a very interesting argument , because it 's one of the most important arguments for the critics but i think it 's crazy because the pictures were taken five or 10 months ago and they will be online for five or 10 years .
but if i want to get into a house and commit a crime , i wo n't use a picture that is many years old .
i could just use a postcard , for example , as a basis for burglary .
i think that 's not very realistic , but it 's very nice for a symbolic discussion .
are you surprised that there have n't been more cities that have welcomed google like oberstaufen has ?
i was not surprised because usually in germany you wait -lsb- to not draw attention to yourself -rsb- .
as long as you 're waiting , nobody is criticizing you .
i think it 's german , and it 's normal that no other towns really said , " we like google and we welcome google and we see a lot of positive aspects in this theme . "
after we said we like google and we support google street view , in our region , other towns and villages said , " we like would like to have them here , but you have to be the pioneer . "

the kazakhs held die mannschaft for the first 45 minutes of the encounter , but were unable to stem the germans ’ flow of attacking football in the second half .
the first goal came from miroslav klose , who , finding the net for the third time in two games , slotted home three minutes after the break .
substitute mario gomez added a second goal in the 78th minute and lukas podolski put the final touch on the score line five minutes from fulltime .
the victory puts germany at the top of their group on 12 points , five clear of their nearest rival austria , who played out a thrilling 4-4 draw with belgium in tuesday 's late game .
the loss leaves kazakhstan bottom of the group with zero points .
germany coach joachim loew said that he was pleased with the result : " we achieved what we wanted to do , but obviously some errors occurred . "
" we have 12 points .
that is what we wanted , so i have to be satisfied .
what the team managed to achieve this year has been great , i ca n't expect them to be brilliant in every game , " he said .
" we have a lead at the top and that is comfortable , but we still need to win a few games before we can plan for the finals . "
in the third group a game played tuesday , azerbaijan pulled off a shock 1-0 win at home over a much-fancied turkey , who earlier in the week had gone down to germany in berlin .
the euro 2012 championships are to be held in poland and ukraine .

" it was not easy , and yet we watched as the official law enforcement forces demonstrated unequivocally your support for the rights of all . "
more than 150 people were injured sunday in downtown belgrade in running battles with police as thousands of far-right demonstrators tried to disrupt the march by hurling molotov cocktails and stun grenades at police .

however , one city in the southern state of bavaria , oberstaufen , has publicly supported google street view - and may be the only city in the country that has supported the company to such a great degree .
in an interview with deutsche welle , bianca keybach , the head of oberstaufen 's tourist office , explained why the city even went so far as to bake for google .
deutsche welle : oberstaufen made a video and even baked a cake for google .
is that right ? bianca keybach : yes , we made a cake for google to welcome them and we put it into our facebook fan page and afterward we sent an invitation to google to say that we would be glad to welcome them here , and then google contacted us and we will see what happens .
when google contacted you , what happened ?
they were thankful for being so positive because this was a very big discussion in germany , -lsb- due to privacy -rsb- and taking pictures and everybody says we do n't want that .
we were one of the towns that said we would like -lsb- street view -rsb- .
tell me why you want google taking street view photographs in your town ?
what do you hope to accomplish other than to show how great the town is ?
i think that it would be an additional service for our guests .
when they are choosing a hotel or reading our brochures or they look at our homepage and they ca n't really say if everything is true , if there is a big street next to the hotel .
with google street view they can look into the town and discover the street , discover the region and after the holidays they can show their family and friends where they have been and what they can recommend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bianca keybach is the head of oberstaufen 's tourism office google has sent out their street view vehicles to big cities around germany , and they 're going to be releasing the photos for the 20 biggest cities around germany later this year .
have they actually sent a car to oberstaufen ?
they 've been here last year or at the beginning of this year .
they were in oberstaufen .
nobody saw them , though .
they took pictures and they have them and we 'll all waiting if there 's any chance that we can go on street view as soon as possible .
some have argued against street view because they say criminals could use it to plan robberies .
do you think that 's a valid argument ?
that 's a very interesting argument , because it 's one of the most important arguments for the critics but i think it 's crazy because the pictures were taken five or 10 months ago and they will be online for five or 10 years .
but if i want to get into a house and commit a crime , i wo n't use a picture that is many years old .
i could just use a postcard , for example , as a basis for burglary .
i think that 's not very realistic , but it 's very nice for a symbolic discussion .
are you surprised that there have n't been more cities that have welcomed google like oberstaufen has ?
i was not surprised because usually in germany you wait -lsb- to not draw attention to yourself -rsb- .
as long as you 're waiting , nobody is criticizing you .
i think it 's german , and it 's normal that no other towns really said , " we like google and we welcome google and we see a lot of positive aspects in this theme . "
after we said we like google and we support google street view , in our region , other towns and villages said , " we like would like to have them here , but you have to be the pioneer . "
we are glad that we decided to be very open .
now you mentioned earlier that you sent google a cake .
what kind of cake was it ?
i think it was a chocolate cake that was covered in frosting .
we just took a picture of the cake and sent the picture by e-mail , by twitter and we put it on facebook and we sent a real invitation that as soon as they come to take the other pictures of oberstaufen we will welcome them with the original cake .

but not all germans are happy that their homes , cars and even themselves could be online for all to see . some 1 million germans make use of the street view service daily for a virtual ground 's eye look of the world , according to google .
but the company has been heavily criticized in germany as it gets ready to put maps of german cities online , which the company plans to do by the end of the year .
much of that criticism has come from the southern german state of bavaria , and the region around the city of ingolstadt in particular .
" the problem with google street view is that google - without asking - has gone and photographed german houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used , " georg schaeff , the publisher of the ingolstadt-based daily donaukurier , told deutsche welle .
the newspaper has publicized local opposition to the service for the last two years .
that 's a problem in germany since the country 's highest court has affirmed citizens ' rights to control who has their personal information and how it 's used .
google gives ground " we take privacy very seriously , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service . "
the california tech giant has made concessions to german privacy advocates by allowing material to be made unrecognizable before being published , which it has n't done in the other 23 countries street view is online .
furthermore , after facing widespread criticism , it doubled the opt-out period to eight weeks , which ends on friday .
some 200,000 people have taken google up on the offer to have their homes or apartment building blurred , according to a report in the german news magazine der spiegel .
google , which automatically blurs the faces and vehicle license plates its computer can recognize and asks users to point out the ones it misses , has not commented on the number of opt-out it has received .
bildunterschrift : some 200,000 people have removed themselves from street view , a german magazine reported but schaeff said people have no way of making sure what they see as a violation of their privacy really gets deleted .
he added that citizens have little recourse if google does n't agree with their claim of a privacy infringement by the panoramic photos of whatever is visible from the street taken by the eight cameras mounted on the company 's car .
" individual citizens ca n't assert themselves against these kinds of companies , " he said .
" and the corporations do n't bother to consider if what they are doing is illegal or not .
google works on the premise of ' why ask for permission when you can beg for forgiveness after the fact ? " '
privacy rift but privacy advocates still have a lot of convincing to do .
some 41 percent of germans see more positive than negative aspects to street view and 16 percent say they have or will remove their homes from the service , according to an august study by the emnid research institute .
many ingolstadt locals agreed with the poll 's sentiment .
" google can go ahead and do it , because everyone leaves their tracks all over the internet and everywhere else , " said ingo zingel , an ingolstadt resident .
" whether someone takes a picture of the door to my house really does n't matter . "
schaeff said he 's not surprised that some people do n't seem concerned about what 's happening to their personal information .
" i think there is a rift in society where half the people do n't see a problem and do n't know what 's coming down the road , " he said .
" the other half is much more sensitive and is more careful because the situation is far from clear . "
what 's unclear , he added , is how images from street view - or any other type of geodata , such as that collected by mobile phone providers - can be used to create profiles of individuals that are later sold to third parties .
without knowing how personal data will be used , he said people should give out as little as possible .
" each piece of personal information is like a stone that creates a mosaic , " schaeff said .
" every little stone plays a meaningful role , but , unfortunately , you ca n't tell what the role is until the whole picture has been made . "
' sensible areas ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 41 percent germans said street view has more positive than negative aspects but there are some pictures thomas herker , the mayor of pfaffenhofen , just south of ingolstadt , said he knows he does n't want made .
while he insisted that city hall and pubic offices be visible in street view , he added that some public buildings should be unrecognizable on the internet .
" we requested that google remove public kindergartens and schools , " he said referring to a letter the city sent in december 2009 to google 's german headquarters in hamburg .
" two weeks ago we were told they would not do it because only private individuals - not municipalities - have a right to remove property . "
herker led a group of bavarian mayors which sent another request to google asking for the company to respect their wishes and remove kindergartens and other " sensible areas " from street view .
while herker is left hoping google accounts for his city 's wishes , the point may become moot if the service goes online as planned by the end of the year .
the last time herker wrote to google it took 10 months to get a form letter response .
if it takes that long again the pictures will have long been online for all to see .
" there are three companies in germany that , in my opinion , are problematic : deutsche telekom , deutsche bahn , and now i 've added google to the list , " he said .
" i can only hope that google will change its mind and make it possible to remove public property from the service . "

earlier , she warned bosnia it was falling behind in integrating with europe . us secretary of state hillary clinton has praised the decision by balkan nation serbia to return to talks with its breakaway province of kosovo , in an effort to resolve the long-running standoff over kosovo ’ s 2008 declaration of independence .
" that dialog can and will benefit people in kosovo and in serbia by addressing practical , day-to-day issues and the long-term relationship between you , " clinton said after talks with serbian president boris tadic in belgrade .
tadic , meanwhile , said serbia wanted " to be predictable partners , " adding that " only in that way will we rebuild trust . "
many serbians still remember clinton 's husband , former us president bill clinton , as the leader who supported the 1999 nato bombing that led to serbia 's withdrawal from kosovo .
praise for police clinton also used her visit to belgrade to praise serbian police for protecting a weekend gay pride march from attacks , as prosecutors opened a criminal investigation against the leader of a far-right group for orchestrating the violent anti-gay protests .
" i especially want to commend the bravery of the police who provided security for the event at last sunday 's pride parade , " clinton said .
" it was not easy , and yet we watched as the official law enforcement forces demonstrated unequivocally your support for the rights of all . "
more than 150 people were injured sunday in downtown belgrade in running battles with police as thousands of far-right demonstrators tried to disrupt the march by hurling molotov cocktails and stun grenades at police .
clinton : bosnia must do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton was welcomed by the serbian people earlier tuesday , clinton visited bosnia , where she warned the balkan country it was falling behind its neighbors in integrating with europe .
she said bosnia risked having its hopes of joining the european union and nato dashed unless it starts bridging its internal political and ethnic divide .
the country is ethnically divided along bosniak , serb and croat lines .
" hatreds have eased , but nationalism persists , " she said .
" meanwhile , the promise of greater stability and opportunity , represented by integration into europe , remains out of reach .
" your neighbors have taken strides in that direction , " clinton continued .
" now is the time for the citizens of this country to make your voices heard . "
clinton will travel to kosovo on wednesday on the second and final day of her diplomatic tour of the war-torn region .
she is expected to push the government in pristina to make the most of talks with serbia .
the us is among 70 states , including most of the 27 eu countries , to have recognized kosovo 's independence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 12.10.2010 turkish eu affairs minister tells turkish germans to integrate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagis told turkish germans to accept german customs days after the leaders of germany and turkey pledged to cooperate more on the integration of germany 's substantial turkish minority , a turkish politician tells turkish germans integration is a responsibility . turkish european union affairs minister egemen bagis has called on turks in germany to better integrate themselves into german culture , inserting himself into a fierce and ongoing debate on the integration of germany 's turkish minority .
" learn german !
adjust to the customs of your host country , " he told daily newspaper bild in an interview published on tuesday .
" you do n't have to give up the gift of your identity and culture , but rather think of yourselves as ambassadors for turkey .
only then can you build bridges for a better friendship and partnership between our countries . "
three days before his comments were published , german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan met in berlin on the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between the two countries , pledging to cooperate more on integration of turks living in germany .
multi-faceted integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to work together on integration ines michalowski , a senior researcher at berlin 's social science research center , said the call for turkish-germans to maintain their culture while still adjusting to german customs may seem paradoxical , but that the two are not mutually exclusive .
" the turkish nation-state is a very nationalistic nation , where there are actually claims of turks belonging to the turkish nation-state even though they have been living abroad for several generations , " she told deutsche welle .
" but that does n't mean that integration on the labor market , or in the educational system , or contacts with germans - that these aspects of integration go badly . "
still , research shows that most turkish germans are poorly integrated in these areas - a fact which haci halil uslucan , director of the center for turkish studies and integration research , said can not be entirely attributed to a perceived lack of motivation of immigrants to integrate themselves .
" i think we also have to focus on the conditions of being integrated - and that means the attitudes of the majority , the look of the majority on the minority , " he told deutsche welle .
" the political discussion should not go in this direction of creating ranks - these are the good immigrants and these are the bad ones .
that only increases social tension . "
education is key bagis also said in his interview that turkish-german parents should send their children " to the best schools , so that they have a future , " echoing comments by prime minister erdogan that turkish-germans should prioritize education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research shows other minorities have integrated better than turks michalowski said studies of vietnamese immigrant parents in the eastern state of brandenburg have shown their children to have higher high-school graduation and college entrance rates than non-immigrant german children , partly because the parents place a high priority on education .
" some of the criticism has been that maybe turkish parents are not putting enough emphasis on getting a good education within germany , " she said .
" so if there is a government official from turkey who actually encourages people to pay more attention to the education of their children , i think that can never do any harm . "
but uslucan said other research shows that turkish-german parents have high educational aspirations for their children , and that teachers often send young turkish students to lower-level high schools that do not feed into universities , even when their educational performance is as good as their non-turkish peers .
" the doctrine must be that turkish parents should have more information about the german educational system , " he said .
" i think there is the problem that turkish parents do n't have enough information on what the best school is . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has made entry into the eu a high priority ambassadors for turkish eu accession in addition to his post as eu affairs minister , bagis is also chiefly responsible for negotiating turkey 's accession into the bloc .
while merkel has called turkey 's accession process " open-ended with no guarantees , " the turkish government has made it a high priority .
michalowski said bagis 's call on immigrants to integrate could be seen as a way of enhancing turkey 's chances of gaining eu membership .
" if you have a well-integrated minority , people in germany may be more favorable to the idea of turkey becoming a member of the european union than if the turkish community is always in the media as being badly integrated , " she said .

europe 's social affairs commissioner said financial help is available to member states . the european commission will once again push member states to do more to improve the situation for roma travelers on tuesday at a conference in bucharest .
the meeting was organized after the french government began its deportations of roma families over the summer , drawing international criticism .
the bucharest conference aims to promote the better use of eu funds to improve the socio-economic situation of the 10 to 12 million roma living on the continent .
they face discrimination , poverty , segregation , and barriers to education and the labor market in many of the european countries in which they settle .
in slovakia , for example , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education .
in bulgaria , over 50 percent of roma are unemployed .
in romania only about a quarter of roma have a steady job .
european funds are under-used in recent years the european union has brought in a comprehensive financial program to promote the integration of the roma and sinti travelers .
but romania and bulgaria , the eu member states with the biggest roma communities , have made little use of the subsidies .
despite the high-profile debate about integration of roma sparked by france 's crackdown on its traveling community , the european union 's commissioner for social affairs and inclusion complained recently that few nations are drawing on the available financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laszlo andor wants countries to make better use of european funds " i would like to stress that this is the responsibility of the european union and the member states together , " andor said in the european parliament .
" the structural funds offer a very useful financial lever for supporting national efforts to improve the situation of the roma .
however , eu funds are often not fully used , or not used in the most effective way . "
currently romania is only using 1 percent of the 2.25 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- made available by the european social fund between 2007 and 2013 to improve the situation of vulnerable groups .
bulgaria is only using 5 percent of the fund .
integration is not just about money however , there is of course no compulsion to use the money .
the german conservative mep manfred weber hopes there is enough incentive for countries to apply for the money if they need it .
" the decisive factor in integration of course is always that it ca n't be proscribed from above , rather it 's got to happen in the towns , in the communities themselves , " weber told deutsche welle .
" it demands creativity . "
the european commission has set up a working group to assess why the roma struggle so much with integration .
the group will deliver its findings by the end of the year .
in the meantime andor wants member states to set ambitious targets for tackling poverty and improving the educational horizons of the roma .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in slovakia , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education " it 's only about poverty reduction , it 's not only about social inclusion , " the commissioner said .
" we have to ensure that the roma are explicitly mentioned in our new employment flagship initiative , because that 's also where a breakthrough has to be made . "
manfred weber believes governments have to tackle the root of the problem by targeting education .
“ we have to follow through the idea that children of this ethnic minority must attend school .
only then can we succeed in truly integrating these travelling families into european societies . ”
the problems for the roma in europe are not new .
there is money available in europe to tackle it .
but it has taken the row over the policy of deporting roma from france to bring this much-beleaguered community into the spotlight .

but not all germans are happy that their homes , cars and even themselves could be online for all to see . some 1 million germans make use of the street view service daily for a virtual ground 's eye look of the world , according to google .
but the company has been heavily criticized in germany as it gets ready to put maps of german cities online , which the company plans to do by the end of the year .
much of that criticism has come from the southern german state of bavaria , and the region around the city of ingolstadt in particular .
" the problem with google street view is that google - without asking - has gone and photographed german houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used , " georg schaeff , the publisher of the ingolstadt-based daily donaukurier , told deutsche welle .
the newspaper has publicized local opposition to the service for the last two years .
that 's a problem in germany since the country 's highest court has affirmed citizens ' rights to control who has their personal information and how it 's used .
google gives ground " we take privacy very seriously , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service . "
the california tech giant has made concessions to german privacy advocates by allowing material to be made unrecognizable before being published , which it has n't done in the other 23 countries street view is online .
furthermore , after facing widespread criticism , it doubled the opt-out period to eight weeks , which ends on friday .
some 200,000 people have taken google up on the offer to have their homes or apartment building blurred , according to a report in the german news magazine der spiegel .
google , which automatically blurs the faces and vehicle license plates its computer can recognize and asks users to point out the ones it misses , has not commented on the number of opt-out it has received .
bildunterschrift : some 200,000 people have removed themselves from street view , a german magazine reported but schaeff said people have no way of making sure what they see as a violation of their privacy really gets deleted .
he added that citizens have little recourse if google does n't agree with their claim of a privacy infringement by the panoramic photos of whatever is visible from the street taken by the eight cameras mounted on the company 's car .
" individual citizens ca n't assert themselves against these kinds of companies , " he said .
" and the corporations do n't bother to consider if what they are doing is illegal or not .
google works on the premise of ' why ask for permission when you can beg for forgiveness after the fact ? " '
privacy rift but privacy advocates still have a lot of convincing to do .
some 41 percent of germans see more positive than negative aspects to street view and 16 percent say they have or will remove their homes from the service , according to an august study by the emnid research institute .
many ingolstadt locals agreed with the poll 's sentiment .
" google can go ahead and do it , because everyone leaves their tracks all over the internet and everywhere else , " said ingo zingel , an ingolstadt resident .
" whether someone takes a picture of the door to my house really does n't matter . "
schaeff said he 's not surprised that some people do n't seem concerned about what 's happening to their personal information .
" i think there is a rift in society where half the people do n't see a problem and do n't know what 's coming down the road , " he said .
" the other half is much more sensitive and is more careful because the situation is far from clear . "
what 's unclear , he added , is how images from street view - or any other type of geodata , such as that collected by mobile phone providers - can be used to create profiles of individuals that are later sold to third parties .
without knowing how personal data will be used , he said people should give out as little as possible .
" each piece of personal information is like a stone that creates a mosaic , " schaeff said .
" every little stone plays a meaningful role , but , unfortunately , you ca n't tell what the role is until the whole picture has been made . "
' sensible areas ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 41 percent germans said street view has more positive than negative aspects but there are some pictures thomas herker , the mayor of pfaffenhofen , just south of ingolstadt , said he knows he does n't want made .
while he insisted that city hall and pubic offices be visible in street view , he added that some public buildings should be unrecognizable on the internet .
" we requested that google remove public kindergartens and schools , " he said referring to a letter the city sent in december 2009 to google 's german headquarters in hamburg .
" two weeks ago we were told they would not do it because only private individuals - not municipalities - have a right to remove property . "
herker led a group of bavarian mayors which sent another request to google asking for the company to respect their wishes and remove kindergartens and other " sensible areas " from street view .
while herker is left hoping google accounts for his city 's wishes , the point may become moot if the service goes online as planned by the end of the year .
the last time herker wrote to google it took 10 months to get a form letter response .
if it takes that long again the pictures will have long been online for all to see .
" there are three companies in germany that , in my opinion , are problematic : deutsche telekom , deutsche bahn , and now i 've added google to the list , " he said .
" i can only hope that google will change its mind and make it possible to remove public property from the service . "

deutsche welle : oberstaufen made a video and even baked a cake for google .
is that right ? bianca keybach : yes , we made a cake for google to welcome them and we put it into our facebook fan page and afterward we sent an invitation to google to say that we would be glad to welcome them here , and then google contacted us and we will see what happens .
when google contacted you , what happened ?
they were thankful for being so positive because this was a very big discussion in germany , -lsb- due to privacy -rsb- and taking pictures and everybody says we do n't want that .
we were one of the towns that said we would like -lsb- street view -rsb- .
tell me why you want google taking street view photographs in your town ?
what do you hope to accomplish other than to show how great the town is ?
i think that it would be an additional service for our guests .
when they are choosing a hotel or reading our brochures or they look at our homepage and they ca n't really say if everything is true , if there is a big street next to the hotel .
with google street view they can look into the town and discover the street , discover the region and after the holidays they can show their family and friends where they have been and what they can recommend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bianca keybach is the head of oberstaufen 's tourism office google has sent out their street view vehicles to big cities around germany , and they 're going to be releasing the photos for the 20 biggest cities around germany later this year .
have they actually sent a car to oberstaufen ?
they 've been here last year or at the beginning of this year .
they were in oberstaufen .
nobody saw them , though .
they took pictures and they have them and we 'll all waiting if there 's any chance that we can go on street view as soon as possible .
some have argued against street view because they say criminals could use it to plan robberies .
do you think that 's a valid argument ?
that 's a very interesting argument , because it 's one of the most important arguments for the critics but i think it 's crazy because the pictures were taken five or 10 months ago and they will be online for five or 10 years .
but if i want to get into a house and commit a crime , i wo n't use a picture that is many years old .
i could just use a postcard , for example , as a basis for burglary .
i think that 's not very realistic , but it 's very nice for a symbolic discussion .
are you surprised that there have n't been more cities that have welcomed google like oberstaufen has ?
i was not surprised because usually in germany you wait -lsb- to not draw attention to yourself -rsb- .
as long as you 're waiting , nobody is criticizing you .
i think it 's german , and it 's normal that no other towns really said , " we like google and we welcome google and we see a lot of positive aspects in this theme . "
after we said we like google and we support google street view , in our region , other towns and villages said , " we like would like to have them here , but you have to be the pioneer . "
we are glad that we decided to be very open .
now you mentioned earlier that you sent google a cake .
what kind of cake was it ?
i think it was a chocolate cake that was covered in frosting .
we just took a picture of the cake and sent the picture by e-mail , by twitter and we put it on facebook and we sent a real invitation that as soon as they come to take the other pictures of oberstaufen we will welcome them with the original cake .

"
he is hoping his visit will help promote “ sensible arrangements . ”
but observers are skeptical . economics minister rainer bruederle has framed his two-day trip to china , which began in beijing on tuesday , as a pacifying mission , following recent acrimony between china and many g-20 countries over trade .
" the danger of a trade war has appeared on the horizon , " bruederle told reporters traveling with him on his two-day trip to china , which is to include stops in beijing and shanghai .
the minister warned that accusations of currency manipulation should not be allowed to escalate , and protectionism must be avoided .
some of china 's trading partners in the us and europe have recently accused beijing of allowing the yuan to depreciate at a faster pace .
critics say the unit could be undervalued by as much as 40 percent .
ambassador and missionary speaking in beijing , bruederle refuted these claims , pointing out that the yuan had increased in value by 15 to 17 percent in the past two years , and he added that he did not expect the chinese government to adopt flexible trading patterns in the future .
" we must not allow the situation to get out of hand , or turn our backs on free trade , " bruederle said , adding that he saw himself as an " ambassador , perhaps even a missionary , for the fight against protectionism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has faced pressure from the eu over currency depreciation bruederle expressed satisfaction with the state of german-chinese trade , which has grown significantly this year .
german exports to china have grown by 52 percent to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of this year , while chinese exports have risen by 34 percent , compared to 2009 figures .
germany is considered one of china 's best friends in the west .
" the germans have been pushing for an open trade policy towards china , " jonathan holslag of the brussels institute of contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" germany 's economic revival after the financial crisis has been - to a large degree - made in china . "
" most of the expansion in germany 's exports – particularly cars and machinery – has been bound for china , " says holslag .
for this reason , holslag believes , the german government has often cautioned against protectionism towards china .
" angela merkel has also openly expressed her support for granting china market economy status , " holslag points out .
" this would make it more difficult for the european commission to apply anti-dumping procedures . "
good on the small-scale , not so much on the large-scale but despite germany 's huge economic interest in china – not only through exports , but also through direct investment from individual companies – bruederle 's leverage during this trip is likely to be limited .
the minister said that one of his main aims for the trip was to ensure that medium-sized german businesses gained better opportunities in china .
after his meetings with chinese commerce minister chen deming and zhang ping , the head of the country 's top economic planning agency , bruederle said he had been assured that german companies could take part in open competition in china provided they used a minimum of 50 percent local products .
but holslag believes this is a secondary priority for bruederle compared to maintaining export agreements .
" it 's important to distinguish degrees of urgency , " he says .
" the most important objective for the german government is to step up exports , and the second level is access to the chinese market .
germany is likely to be very cautious in negotiations , in order to protect exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery has been largely based on exports to china but despite this , there is concern that german companies are being disadvantaged by the chinese government .
rolf langhammer , vice-president of the kiel institute for the world economy , believes that this is where bruederle can at least make sure german businesses can get their voices heard .
" germany enjoys a very good position in china compared to other european countries , but of course there are barriers to mid-sized german companies , " he told deutsche welle .
" a lot of representatives of these firms are accompanying bruederle . "
langhammer does not think that bruederle can apply much pressure on the question of global exchange rates – the issue he addressed on arrival .
" the chinese government has always made clear that it wo n't let itself be influenced on this subject , and bruederle 's visit wo n't change anything in the discussion about the exchange rate . "
langhammer is also unconvinced by bruederle 's attempt to position himself as a mediator between the china and the west .
" that 's a role he can not play , " he says .
" he is much too small for that .
he does n't speak for the eurozone , he speaks for an export country called germany .
of course he can represent the interests of mid-sized companies , and he can voice their concerns if they feel themselves disadvantaged alongside chinese competition , but he ca n't solve the big questions – and he ca n't be a mediator in them . "

"
he is hoping his visit will help promote “ sensible arrangements . ”
but observers are skeptical . economics minister rainer bruederle has framed his two-day trip to china , which began in beijing on tuesday , as a pacifying mission , following recent acrimony between china and many g-20 countries over trade .
" the danger of a trade war has appeared on the horizon , " bruederle told reporters traveling with him on his two-day trip to china , which is to include stops in beijing and shanghai .
the minister warned that accusations of currency manipulation should not be allowed to escalate , and protectionism must be avoided .
some of china 's trading partners in the us and europe have recently accused beijing of allowing the yuan to depreciate at a faster pace .
critics say the unit could be undervalued by as much as 40 percent .
ambassador and missionary speaking in beijing , bruederle refuted these claims , pointing out that the yuan had increased in value by 15 to 17 percent in the past two years , and he added that he did not expect the chinese government to adopt flexible trading patterns in the future .
" we must not allow the situation to get out of hand , or turn our backs on free trade , " bruederle said , adding that he saw himself as an " ambassador , perhaps even a missionary , for the fight against protectionism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has faced pressure from the eu over currency depreciation bruederle expressed satisfaction with the state of german-chinese trade , which has grown significantly this year .
german exports to china have grown by 52 percent to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of this year , while chinese exports have risen by 34 percent , compared to 2009 figures .
germany is considered one of china 's best friends in the west .
" the germans have been pushing for an open trade policy towards china , " jonathan holslag of the brussels institute of contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" germany 's economic revival after the financial crisis has been - to a large degree - made in china . "
" most of the expansion in germany 's exports – particularly cars and machinery – has been bound for china , " says holslag .
for this reason , holslag believes , the german government has often cautioned against protectionism towards china .
" angela merkel has also openly expressed her support for granting china market economy status , " holslag points out .
" this would make it more difficult for the european commission to apply anti-dumping procedures . "
good on the small-scale , not so much on the large-scale but despite germany 's huge economic interest in china – not only through exports , but also through direct investment from individual companies – bruederle 's leverage during this trip is likely to be limited .
the minister said that one of his main aims for the trip was to ensure that medium-sized german businesses gained better opportunities in china .
after his meetings with chinese commerce minister chen deming and zhang ping , the head of the country 's top economic planning agency , bruederle said he had been assured that german companies could take part in open competition in china provided they used a minimum of 50 percent local products .
but holslag believes this is a secondary priority for bruederle compared to maintaining export agreements .
" it 's important to distinguish degrees of urgency , " he says .
" the most important objective for the german government is to step up exports , and the second level is access to the chinese market .
germany is likely to be very cautious in negotiations , in order to protect exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery has been largely based on exports to china but despite this , there is concern that german companies are being disadvantaged by the chinese government .
rolf langhammer , vice-president of the kiel institute for the world economy , believes that this is where bruederle can at least make sure german businesses can get their voices heard .
" germany enjoys a very good position in china compared to other european countries , but of course there are barriers to mid-sized german companies , " he told deutsche welle .
" a lot of representatives of these firms are accompanying bruederle . "
langhammer does not think that bruederle can apply much pressure on the question of global exchange rates – the issue he addressed on arrival .
" the chinese government has always made clear that it wo n't let itself be influenced on this subject , and bruederle 's visit wo n't change anything in the discussion about the exchange rate . "
langhammer is also unconvinced by bruederle 's attempt to position himself as a mediator between the china and the west .
" that 's a role he can not play , " he says .
" he is much too small for that .
he does n't speak for the eurozone , he speaks for an export country called germany .
of course he can represent the interests of mid-sized companies , and he can voice their concerns if they feel themselves disadvantaged alongside chinese competition , but he ca n't solve the big questions – and he ca n't be a mediator in them . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 12.10.2010 european commission to push member states to do more to help roma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has deported thousands of roma to romania this summer starting tuesday , romania is hosting a two-day conference of european nations to discuss how to help integrate roma travelers .
europe 's social affairs commissioner said financial help is available to member states . the european commission will once again push member states to do more to improve the situation for roma travelers on tuesday at a conference in bucharest .
the meeting was organized after the french government began its deportations of roma families over the summer , drawing international criticism .
the bucharest conference aims to promote the better use of eu funds to improve the socio-economic situation of the 10 to 12 million roma living on the continent .
they face discrimination , poverty , segregation , and barriers to education and the labor market in many of the european countries in which they settle .
in slovakia , for example , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education .
in bulgaria , over 50 percent of roma are unemployed .
in romania only about a quarter of roma have a steady job .
european funds are under-used in recent years the european union has brought in a comprehensive financial program to promote the integration of the roma and sinti travelers .
but romania and bulgaria , the eu member states with the biggest roma communities , have made little use of the subsidies .
despite the high-profile debate about integration of roma sparked by france 's crackdown on its traveling community , the european union 's commissioner for social affairs and inclusion complained recently that few nations are drawing on the available financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laszlo andor wants countries to make better use of european funds " i would like to stress that this is the responsibility of the european union and the member states together , " andor said in the european parliament .
" the structural funds offer a very useful financial lever for supporting national efforts to improve the situation of the roma .
however , eu funds are often not fully used , or not used in the most effective way . "
currently romania is only using 1 percent of the 2.25 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- made available by the european social fund between 2007 and 2013 to improve the situation of vulnerable groups .
bulgaria is only using 5 percent of the fund .
integration is not just about money however , there is of course no compulsion to use the money .
the german conservative mep manfred weber hopes there is enough incentive for countries to apply for the money if they need it .
" the decisive factor in integration of course is always that it ca n't be proscribed from above , rather it 's got to happen in the towns , in the communities themselves , " weber told deutsche welle .
" it demands creativity . "
the european commission has set up a working group to assess why the roma struggle so much with integration .
the group will deliver its findings by the end of the year .
in the meantime andor wants member states to set ambitious targets for tackling poverty and improving the educational horizons of the roma .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in slovakia , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education " it 's only about poverty reduction , it 's not only about social inclusion , " the commissioner said .
" we have to ensure that the roma are explicitly mentioned in our new employment flagship initiative , because that 's also where a breakthrough has to be made . "
manfred weber believes governments have to tackle the root of the problem by targeting education .
“ we have to follow through the idea that children of this ethnic minority must attend school .
only then can we succeed in truly integrating these travelling families into european societies . ”
the problems for the roma in europe are not new .
there is money available in europe to tackle it .
but it has taken the row over the policy of deporting roma from france to bring this much-beleaguered community into the spotlight .

but not all germans are happy that their homes , cars and even themselves could be online for all to see . some 1 million germans make use of the street view service daily for a virtual ground 's eye look of the world , according to google .
but the company has been heavily criticized in germany as it gets ready to put maps of german cities online , which the company plans to do by the end of the year .
much of that criticism has come from the southern german state of bavaria , and the region around the city of ingolstadt in particular .
" the problem with google street view is that google - without asking - has gone and photographed german houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used , " georg schaeff , the publisher of the ingolstadt-based daily donaukurier , told deutsche welle .
the newspaper has publicized local opposition to the service for the last two years .
that 's a problem in germany since the country 's highest court has affirmed citizens ' rights to control who has their personal information and how it 's used .
google gives ground " we take privacy very seriously , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service . "
the california tech giant has made concessions to german privacy advocates by allowing material to be made unrecognizable before being published , which it has n't done in the other 23 countries street view is online .
furthermore , after facing widespread criticism , it doubled the opt-out period to eight weeks , which ends on friday .
some 200,000 people have taken google up on the offer to have their homes or apartment building blurred , according to a report in the german news magazine der spiegel .
google , which automatically blurs the faces and vehicle license plates its computer can recognize and asks users to point out the ones it misses , has not commented on the number of opt-out it has received .
bildunterschrift : some 200,000 people have removed themselves from street view , a german magazine reported but schaeff said people have no way of making sure what they see as a violation of their privacy really gets deleted .
he added that citizens have little recourse if google does n't agree with their claim of a privacy infringement by the panoramic photos of whatever is visible from the street taken by the eight cameras mounted on the company 's car .
" individual citizens ca n't assert themselves against these kinds of companies , " he said .
" and the corporations do n't bother to consider if what they are doing is illegal or not .
google works on the premise of ' why ask for permission when you can beg for forgiveness after the fact ? " '
privacy rift but privacy advocates still have a lot of convincing to do .
some 41 percent of germans see more positive than negative aspects to street view and 16 percent say they have or will remove their homes from the service , according to an august study by the emnid research institute .
many ingolstadt locals agreed with the poll 's sentiment .
" google can go ahead and do it , because everyone leaves their tracks all over the internet and everywhere else , " said ingo zingel , an ingolstadt resident .
" whether someone takes a picture of the door to my house really does n't matter . "
schaeff said he 's not surprised that some people do n't seem concerned about what 's happening to their personal information .
" i think there is a rift in society where half the people do n't see a problem and do n't know what 's coming down the road , " he said .
" the other half is much more sensitive and is more careful because the situation is far from clear . "
what 's unclear , he added , is how images from street view - or any other type of geodata , such as that collected by mobile phone providers - can be used to create profiles of individuals that are later sold to third parties .
without knowing how personal data will be used , he said people should give out as little as possible .
" each piece of personal information is like a stone that creates a mosaic , " schaeff said .
" every little stone plays a meaningful role , but , unfortunately , you ca n't tell what the role is until the whole picture has been made . "
' sensible areas ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 41 percent germans said street view has more positive than negative aspects but there are some pictures thomas herker , the mayor of pfaffenhofen , just south of ingolstadt , said he knows he does n't want made .
while he insisted that city hall and pubic offices be visible in street view , he added that some public buildings should be unrecognizable on the internet .
" we requested that google remove public kindergartens and schools , " he said referring to a letter the city sent in december 2009 to google 's german headquarters in hamburg .
" two weeks ago we were told they would not do it because only private individuals - not municipalities - have a right to remove property . "
herker led a group of bavarian mayors which sent another request to google asking for the company to respect their wishes and remove kindergartens and other " sensible areas " from street view .
while herker is left hoping google accounts for his city 's wishes , the point may become moot if the service goes online as planned by the end of the year .
the last time herker wrote to google it took 10 months to get a form letter response .
if it takes that long again the pictures will have long been online for all to see .
" there are three companies in germany that , in my opinion , are problematic : deutsche telekom , deutsche bahn , and now i 've added google to the list , " he said .
" i can only hope that google will change its mind and make it possible to remove public property from the service . "

however , one city in the southern state of bavaria , oberstaufen , has publicly supported google street view - and may be the only city in the country that has supported the company to such a great degree .
in an interview with deutsche welle , bianca keybach , the head of oberstaufen 's tourist office , explained why the city even went so far as to bake for google .
deutsche welle : oberstaufen made a video and even baked a cake for google .
is that right ? bianca keybach : yes , we made a cake for google to welcome them and we put it into our facebook fan page and afterward we sent an invitation to google to say that we would be glad to welcome them here , and then google contacted us and we will see what happens .
when google contacted you , what happened ?
they were thankful for being so positive because this was a very big discussion in germany , -lsb- due to privacy -rsb- and taking pictures and everybody says we do n't want that .
we were one of the towns that said we would like -lsb- street view -rsb- .
tell me why you want google taking street view photographs in your town ?
what do you hope to accomplish other than to show how great the town is ?
i think that it would be an additional service for our guests .
when they are choosing a hotel or reading our brochures or they look at our homepage and they ca n't really say if everything is true , if there is a big street next to the hotel .
with google street view they can look into the town and discover the street , discover the region and after the holidays they can show their family and friends where they have been and what they can recommend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bianca keybach is the head of oberstaufen 's tourism office google has sent out their street view vehicles to big cities around germany , and they 're going to be releasing the photos for the 20 biggest cities around germany later this year .
have they actually sent a car to oberstaufen ?
they 've been here last year or at the beginning of this year .
they were in oberstaufen .
nobody saw them , though .
they took pictures and they have them and we 'll all waiting if there 's any chance that we can go on street view as soon as possible .
some have argued against street view because they say criminals could use it to plan robberies .
do you think that 's a valid argument ?
that 's a very interesting argument , because it 's one of the most important arguments for the critics but i think it 's crazy because the pictures were taken five or 10 months ago and they will be online for five or 10 years .
but if i want to get into a house and commit a crime , i wo n't use a picture that is many years old .
i could just use a postcard , for example , as a basis for burglary .
i think that 's not very realistic , but it 's very nice for a symbolic discussion .
are you surprised that there have n't been more cities that have welcomed google like oberstaufen has ?
i was not surprised because usually in germany you wait -lsb- to not draw attention to yourself -rsb- .
as long as you 're waiting , nobody is criticizing you .
i think it 's german , and it 's normal that no other towns really said , " we like google and we welcome google and we see a lot of positive aspects in this theme . "
after we said we like google and we support google street view , in our region , other towns and villages said , " we like would like to have them here , but you have to be the pioneer . "
we are glad that we decided to be very open .
now you mentioned earlier that you sent google a cake .
what kind of cake was it ?
i think it was a chocolate cake that was covered in frosting .
we just took a picture of the cake and sent the picture by e-mail , by twitter and we put it on facebook and we sent a real invitation that as soon as they come to take the other pictures of oberstaufen we will welcome them with the original cake .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 12.10.2010 turkish eu affairs minister tells turkish germans to integrate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagis told turkish germans to accept german customs days after the leaders of germany and turkey pledged to cooperate more on the integration of germany 's substantial turkish minority , a turkish politician tells turkish germans integration is a responsibility . turkish european union affairs minister egemen bagis has called on turks in germany to better integrate themselves into german culture , inserting himself into a fierce and ongoing debate on the integration of germany 's turkish minority .
" learn german !
adjust to the customs of your host country , " he told daily newspaper bild in an interview published on tuesday .
" you do n't have to give up the gift of your identity and culture , but rather think of yourselves as ambassadors for turkey .
only then can you build bridges for a better friendship and partnership between our countries . "
three days before his comments were published , german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan met in berlin on the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between the two countries , pledging to cooperate more on integration of turks living in germany .
multi-faceted integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to work together on integration ines michalowski , a senior researcher at berlin 's social science research center , said the call for turkish-germans to maintain their culture while still adjusting to german customs may seem paradoxical , but that the two are not mutually exclusive .
" the turkish nation-state is a very nationalistic nation , where there are actually claims of turks belonging to the turkish nation-state even though they have been living abroad for several generations , " she told deutsche welle .
" but that does n't mean that integration on the labor market , or in the educational system , or contacts with germans - that these aspects of integration go badly . "
still , research shows that most turkish germans are poorly integrated in these areas - a fact which haci halil uslucan , director of the center for turkish studies and integration research , said can not be entirely attributed to a perceived lack of motivation of immigrants to integrate themselves .
" i think we also have to focus on the conditions of being integrated - and that means the attitudes of the majority , the look of the majority on the minority , " he told deutsche welle .
" the political discussion should not go in this direction of creating ranks - these are the good immigrants and these are the bad ones .
that only increases social tension . "
education is key bagis also said in his interview that turkish-german parents should send their children " to the best schools , so that they have a future , " echoing comments by prime minister erdogan that turkish-germans should prioritize education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research shows other minorities have integrated better than turks michalowski said studies of vietnamese immigrant parents in the eastern state of brandenburg have shown their children to have higher high-school graduation and college entrance rates than non-immigrant german children , partly because the parents place a high priority on education .
" some of the criticism has been that maybe turkish parents are not putting enough emphasis on getting a good education within germany , " she said .
" so if there is a government official from turkey who actually encourages people to pay more attention to the education of their children , i think that can never do any harm . "
but uslucan said other research shows that turkish-german parents have high educational aspirations for their children , and that teachers often send young turkish students to lower-level high schools that do not feed into universities , even when their educational performance is as good as their non-turkish peers .
" the doctrine must be that turkish parents should have more information about the german educational system , " he said .
" i think there is the problem that turkish parents do n't have enough information on what the best school is . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has made entry into the eu a high priority ambassadors for turkish eu accession in addition to his post as eu affairs minister , bagis is also chiefly responsible for negotiating turkey 's accession into the bloc .
while merkel has called turkey 's accession process " open-ended with no guarantees , " the turkish government has made it a high priority .
michalowski said bagis 's call on immigrants to integrate could be seen as a way of enhancing turkey 's chances of gaining eu membership .
" if you have a well-integrated minority , people in germany may be more favorable to the idea of turkey becoming a member of the european union than if the turkish community is always in the media as being badly integrated , " she said .

the two-day conference is being held in the romanian capital , bucharest . european union officials , romanian politicians and roma representatives are discussing integration issues regarding europe 's roma population at a two-day eu conference held in romania 's capital , bucharest .
the conference is aimed at finding solutions on how to achieve more with the money spent by the european union on integrating roma , said the european commissioner for employment and social affairs , laszlo andor , at the opening of the conference .
" a lot has been done in terms of strategic planning , coordination and implementation , but at the end of the day , not much has really changed . " he said .
andor wants eu member states to become more engaged in integrating their roma population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " not much has really changed " - andor said at the conference " the eu can not solve the multi-layered problems of the roma by itself , " he said .
" the european union is ready to step up its efforts for roma integration , but that is also what we expect from all member states . "
funding is available , yet few members take the money even though the european union has funds available , member states refrain from using the money .
from 2007 until 2013 , the european social fund offered 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.1 billion -rrb- to help finance education and housing projects for roma .
especially countries with a high number of roma population like hungary , bulgaria and romania were expected make use of the funds .
the eu has installed a task force in order to find out why member states do not act even though the funds are available .
the task force is expected to present its results by the end of this year .
hungarian prime minister viktor orban said that the integration of roma would be one of the main focuses in hungary 's term in the eu presidency beginning in january .
according to andor , france 's drastic measures of expelling thousands of roma were " very unfortunate " , but " ironically energized the discussions on roma inclusion . "
problem of roma integration will not affect schengen talks german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting romanian prime minister emil boc that the problem of roma integration would not affect negotiations on romania becoming part of the schengen zone .
being a country within the schengen treaty would give romanian citizen visa-free travel within the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a long way from the end of the road , " - according to chancellor merkel merkel said that germany would judge romania 's development on their way to the schengen treaty fairly - but did not promise a quick entrance to the schengen zone .
" the reforms of the judiciary and of interior affairs are being tackled very courageously , but you are still a long way from the end of the road , " merkel said . " we back romania 's efforts to join the schengen zone ... but we must make sure that visa delivery procedures are not marred by corruption , " she said .
it is crucial that romania only issue visas without signs of corruption or unregularities and that eu 's external borders are safe .
" there are no reasonable alternatives to transparent and clear legal terms . " romania is hoping to enter the schengen zone in the middle of 2011 .
the country has been a member of the eu since 2007 .
most of europe 's roma are said to live in romania , but there are no reliable numbers - with figures ranging from a population of 530,000 up to 2.5 million .

germany is up against portugal and canada . the 192-member general assembly convened in new york on tuesday to select five countries to serve two-year terms that begin on january 1 , 2011 .
the race for two of the seats on the united nations security council was expected to be tight , with germany , portugal and canada all vying for two non-permanent seats in the western europe and others category .
south africa , india , and colombia are running for the african , asian and latin american seats , respectively , and are almost certain to be elected on the first ballot , since their candidacies are unopposed .
germany confident german chancellor angela merkel , on the sidelines of the un millennium development summit in new york last month , campaigned personally for a seat on the security council .
foreign minister guido westerwelle , also at the summit , expressed confidence that his country would be named to the world body .
" germany is renowned around the world for its reliability , for its active pursuit of freedom and global development , " westerwelle told the general assembly and a host of world leaders at the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is confident that germany will be chosen he also referred in his speech to germany 's status as the third largest financial contributor to the united nations , in addition to insisting that berlin would continue to strive for peace as part of the security council .
" to be a member of the security council would mean a very important opportunity for germany .
it would mean that we could play an active role in establishing peace and disarmament around the world .
for , in the end , we must prevent countries around the world - among them even terrorist nations - from acquiring nuclear weapons . "
germany 's ambassador to the un , peter wittig , said ahead of tuesday 's vote that the country had been " working on the campaign for years , " adding that it would be " a significant contribution to germany 's position in the world . "
" canada and portugal are very strong candidates and they are close allies and friends .
secret votes are always unpredictable , but we are convinced that we have a very good chance , " wittig added .
5 + -lrb- 5 + 5 -rrb- = 15 the security council is composed of five permanent members who wield veto power : the united states , china , france , russia and britain .
ten other non-permanent members are selected to the body for two-year terms , with five replaced each year . the five categories represent the african , asian , latin-american , and western european and other geographical regions .
bildunterschrift : this vote is expected to be more interesting than those previous years diplomats see the 2011 race as more interesting than in previous years because of the presence of india , brazil and possibly germany -lrb- if elected on tuesday -rrb- , countries that have demanded permanent veto seats in the past .
permanent seat germany 's ultimate goal if elected to a non-permanent role on tuesday , germany says it will push to expand the 15-member council , which would greatly enhance its chances to become a permanent veto member .
the general assembly began discussion in the 1980s to reform and enlarge the security council from the current 15 to 21 or 26 members in order to reflect un membership 's demands for representation .
at the moment , the composition of the security council still reflects the distribution of political power as it stood at the end of the second world war .

the kazakhs held die mannschaft for the first 45 minutes of the encounter , but were unable to stem the germans ’ flow of attacking football in the second half .
the first goal came from miroslav klose , who , finding the net for the third time in two games , slotted home three minutes after the break .
substitute mario gomez added a second goal in the 78th minute and lukas podolski put the final touch on the score line five minutes from fulltime .
the victory puts germany at the top of their group on 12 points , five clear of their nearest rival austria , who played out a thrilling 4-4 draw with belgium in tuesday 's late game .
the loss leaves kazakhstan bottom of the group with zero points .
germany coach joachim loew said that he was pleased with the result : " we achieved what we wanted to do , but obviously some errors occurred . "
" we have 12 points .
that is what we wanted , so i have to be satisfied .
what the team managed to achieve this year has been great , i ca n't expect them to be brilliant in every game , " he said .
" we have a lead at the top and that is comfortable , but we still need to win a few games before we can plan for the finals . "
in the third group a game played tuesday , azerbaijan pulled off a shock 1-0 win at home over a much-fancied turkey , who earlier in the week had gone down to germany in berlin .
the euro 2012 championships are to be held in poland and ukraine .

the two-day conference is being held in the romanian capital , bucharest . european union officials , romanian politicians and roma representatives are discussing integration issues regarding europe 's roma population at a two-day eu conference held in romania 's capital , bucharest .
the conference is aimed at finding solutions on how to achieve more with the money spent by the european union on integrating roma , said the european commissioner for employment and social affairs , laszlo andor , at the opening of the conference .
" a lot has been done in terms of strategic planning , coordination and implementation , but at the end of the day , not much has really changed . " he said .
andor wants eu member states to become more engaged in integrating their roma population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " not much has really changed " - andor said at the conference " the eu can not solve the multi-layered problems of the roma by itself , " he said .
" the european union is ready to step up its efforts for roma integration , but that is also what we expect from all member states . "
funding is available , yet few members take the money even though the european union has funds available , member states refrain from using the money .
from 2007 until 2013 , the european social fund offered 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.1 billion -rrb- to help finance education and housing projects for roma .
especially countries with a high number of roma population like hungary , bulgaria and romania were expected make use of the funds .
the eu has installed a task force in order to find out why member states do not act even though the funds are available .
the task force is expected to present its results by the end of this year .
hungarian prime minister viktor orban said that the integration of roma would be one of the main focuses in hungary 's term in the eu presidency beginning in january .
according to andor , france 's drastic measures of expelling thousands of roma were " very unfortunate " , but " ironically energized the discussions on roma inclusion . "
problem of roma integration will not affect schengen talks german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting romanian prime minister emil boc that the problem of roma integration would not affect negotiations on romania becoming part of the schengen zone .
being a country within the schengen treaty would give romanian citizen visa-free travel within the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a long way from the end of the road , " - according to chancellor merkel merkel said that germany would judge romania 's development on their way to the schengen treaty fairly - but did not promise a quick entrance to the schengen zone .
" the reforms of the judiciary and of interior affairs are being tackled very courageously , but you are still a long way from the end of the road , " merkel said . " we back romania 's efforts to join the schengen zone ... but we must make sure that visa delivery procedures are not marred by corruption , " she said .
it is crucial that romania only issue visas without signs of corruption or unregularities and that eu 's external borders are safe .
" there are no reasonable alternatives to transparent and clear legal terms . " romania is hoping to enter the schengen zone in the middle of 2011 .
the country has been a member of the eu since 2007 .
most of europe 's roma are said to live in romania , but there are no reliable numbers - with figures ranging from a population of 530,000 up to 2.5 million .

but many observers say that its chances of succeeding are less than slim . in the current format , the un general assembly annually elects five new , non-permanent security council members to two-year terms to replace the five members that will leave the council at the end of december .
the 10 rotating seats are divided among five regions around the world .
only the united states , britain , france , russia and china hold permanent seats on the un security council and the power to veto all resolutions .
germany has been campaigning to join this elite group as part of a more comprehensive project to revamp the council for most of the past decade .
along with india , japan and brazil , germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the un system as part of the g-4 alliance .
the g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
under the alliance 's plan , four of the permanent six seats would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries .
germany 's determination to pursue its goal is supported by what many see as a justified attempt to receive recognition for its contribution to the modern un and more responsibility for a country of its international standing .
" germany is a significant player at the un , " richard gowan , an international relations expert at the european council on foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the mere fact that it pays 8 percent of the budget ensures that .
germany is a constructive voice not only on iran but on issues like peace-building in africa .
it 's a good citizen at the un . "
self-preservation at the heart of opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council continues to show a reluctance to change but after facing consistent opposition to individual and collective g-4 membership , germany 's efforts and that of the alliance appeared to have lost momentum in recent years , primarily due to the growing relationship between india and the united states , which has at times diverted new delhi 's focus , and japan 's insistence on evolving a formula that can not be opposed by the us .
washington 's opposition and that of other major powers to the g-4 plan has been a major stumbling block in recent years , while the so-called " coffee club " - an alliance of pakistan , italy , mexico , argentina , south korea and several other countries opposed to the g-4 - has also emerged as a rival to complicate the g-4 's attempts at reform .
" some permanent members of the security council , like china and russia , are suspicious of any reform that would dilute their power there , " said gowan . " within europe , italy is particularly opposed to germany 's ambitions . it fears that if germany won a permanent seat alongside britain and france , its own influence at the un would decline . "
" britain and france both have a strong rhetorical commitment to germany 's cause , " he added . " however , they will do nothing that compromises their own positions on the council . in the past , germany has campaigned for a permanent seat alongside japan , india and brazil . however , it is possible to imagine scenarios in which rapidly rising powers like brazil and india won permanent seats and germany and japan did not . " g-4 allies could be both a help and hindrance to germany with india set to rejuvenate the g-4 ahead of the 65th un general assembly with a series of meetings with alliance ministers aimed at getting the campaign back on-track , germany hopes a new vigor in the group 's collective efforts to reform the council can enhance its own campaign for a permanent seat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia prefers india and brazil as permanent members " but never underestimate how complex and nasty security council reform negotiations can become , " said gowan .
" the bloc politics are fantastically difficult .
germany also has to be realistic that , while its bid for a permanent seat is taken seriously , it 's actually peripheral to the question of whether india and japan should get such seats . " " the reasons are geopolitical : if india and japan were in the council full-time , it could become a serious center for debate on asian security issues .
it 's not clear whether china wants that .
germany 's presence would probably change the dynamics of the council rather less .
but it 's very hard to imagine a reform process that gave germany a permanent seat but exclude india . that would be political and historical lunacy . " experts unconvinced that german ambitions can be fulfilled a number of experts believe that germany is wasting its time to again lobby for a permanent seat , given the rise to prominence of other states in the geo-political arena , with some saying that the unlikelihood of success or the reform of the council could even persuade chancellor angela merkel to drop the campaign completely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the un : germany may have to accept defeat " it 's very unlikely that germany will try and resurrect their bid for a seat because there really is n't any hope of getting one , " michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" should the necessary reforms go through , the un will offer seats to the likes of india and brazil over germany , due to its policy of promoting the new powers and because of the over-representation of europe on the council . " " i would be very surprised if this attempt were to be successful , " dr. karen smith at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle .
" enlarging the permanent membership of the security council is , i would think , very unlikely to happen . " " the chances of germany getting a permanent seat with a veto comparable to france or britain 's are fairly low , " richard gowan concluded .
" but it could negotiate some sort of semi-permanent seat , one which only requires reelection once every five or 10 years , without a veto .
compromises of this sort have been on the table since the 2005 negotiations on security council reform , and are probably the most realistic option .

earlier , she warned bosnia it was falling behind in integrating with europe . us secretary of state hillary clinton has praised the decision by balkan nation serbia to return to talks with its breakaway province of kosovo , in an effort to resolve the long-running standoff over kosovo ’ s 2008 declaration of independence .
" that dialog can and will benefit people in kosovo and in serbia by addressing practical , day-to-day issues and the long-term relationship between you , " clinton said after talks with serbian president boris tadic in belgrade .
tadic , meanwhile , said serbia wanted " to be predictable partners , " adding that " only in that way will we rebuild trust . "
many serbians still remember clinton 's husband , former us president bill clinton , as the leader who supported the 1999 nato bombing that led to serbia 's withdrawal from kosovo .
praise for police clinton also used her visit to belgrade to praise serbian police for protecting a weekend gay pride march from attacks , as prosecutors opened a criminal investigation against the leader of a far-right group for orchestrating the violent anti-gay protests .
" i especially want to commend the bravery of the police who provided security for the event at last sunday 's pride parade , " clinton said .
" it was not easy , and yet we watched as the official law enforcement forces demonstrated unequivocally your support for the rights of all . "
more than 150 people were injured sunday in downtown belgrade in running battles with police as thousands of far-right demonstrators tried to disrupt the march by hurling molotov cocktails and stun grenades at police .
clinton : bosnia must do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton was welcomed by the serbian people earlier tuesday , clinton visited bosnia , where she warned the balkan country it was falling behind its neighbors in integrating with europe .
she said bosnia risked having its hopes of joining the european union and nato dashed unless it starts bridging its internal political and ethnic divide .
the country is ethnically divided along bosniak , serb and croat lines .
" hatreds have eased , but nationalism persists , " she said .
" meanwhile , the promise of greater stability and opportunity , represented by integration into europe , remains out of reach .
" your neighbors have taken strides in that direction , " clinton continued .
" now is the time for the citizens of this country to make your voices heard . "
clinton will travel to kosovo on wednesday on the second and final day of her diplomatic tour of the war-torn region .
she is expected to push the government in pristina to make the most of talks with serbia .
the us is among 70 states , including most of the 27 eu countries , to have recognized kosovo 's independence .

many serbians still remember clinton 's husband , former us president bill clinton , as the leader who supported the 1999 nato bombing that led to serbia 's withdrawal from kosovo .
praise for police clinton also used her visit to belgrade to praise serbian police for protecting a weekend gay pride march from attacks , as prosecutors opened a criminal investigation against the leader of a far-right group for orchestrating the violent anti-gay protests .
" i especially want to commend the bravery of the police who provided security for the event at last sunday 's pride parade , " clinton said .
" it was not easy , and yet we watched as the official law enforcement forces demonstrated unequivocally your support for the rights of all . "
more than 150 people were injured sunday in downtown belgrade in running battles with police as thousands of far-right demonstrators tried to disrupt the march by hurling molotov cocktails and stun grenades at police .
clinton : bosnia must do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton was welcomed by the serbian people earlier tuesday , clinton visited bosnia , where she warned the balkan country it was falling behind its neighbors in integrating with europe .
she said bosnia risked having its hopes of joining the european union and nato dashed unless it starts bridging its internal political and ethnic divide .
the country is ethnically divided along bosniak , serb and croat lines .
" hatreds have eased , but nationalism persists , " she said .
" meanwhile , the promise of greater stability and opportunity , represented by integration into europe , remains out of reach .
" your neighbors have taken strides in that direction , " clinton continued .
" now is the time for the citizens of this country to make your voices heard . "
clinton will travel to kosovo on wednesday on the second and final day of her diplomatic tour of the war-torn region .
she is expected to push the government in pristina to make the most of talks with serbia .
the us is among 70 states , including most of the 27 eu countries , to have recognized kosovo 's independence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 12.10.2010 militant islam gains ground in the balkans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's feared that some muslim charities could encourage wahhabism a recent online music video featuring macedonians praising osama bin laden has fueled fears that southeastern europe could be emerging as the latest breeding ground for homegrown islamist militants . it has also focused attention on muslim charities active in bosnia , kosovo , serbia , albania , macedonia and european union member bulgaria since the wars in former yugoslavia in the mid-1990s .
many of those charities are funded by oil-rich saudi arabia and propagate wahhabism - the kingdom 's austere and puritan interpretation of islam .
a majority of wahhabis favor peaceful proselytizing of islam while saudi king abdullah has been seeking to soften wahhabi practices as part of his reforms in the kingdom .
militant groups such as osama bin laden 's al-qaeda , the taliban and jihadists in somalia have however embraced significant elements of wahhabism as part of their ideology .
jasmin merdan , a young bosnian who wrote a book after disassociating himself from wahhabis groups in bosnia , warned that " they express their convictions with violence , introduce anarchy in mosques and preach intolerance . " women in the albanian city of skadar have reportedly started covering their heads or wearing the niqab , a full body covering that hides everything but the eyes , in newly found religiosity .
the video posted on youtube is one of several produced by home grown jihadists in the balkans and circulating in the region .
" oh osama , annihilate the american army .
oh osama , raise the muslims ’ honor , " a group of macedonian men chant in albanian on the video .
" in september 2001 you conquered a power .
we all pray for you . "
similar songs calling on southeastern european muslims to join the jihad have been produced in bosnian .
governments and security forces fear that that increased wahhabi activity will produce committed jihadis that could destabilize already fragile nations in southeastern europe and , in the case of bulgaria - where one sixth of the country 's 7.6 million people is muslim - produce a pool of jihadists whose eu passports would grant them easy access to western europe and allow them to blend into society . bulgaria seen as potential breeding ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most bulgarian muslims are of turkish ethnicity bulgaria is the only eu member whose muslim population are not recent immigrants .
most bulgarian muslims like those elsewhere in the balkans are descendants of ethnic turks who arrived during five centuries of ottoman rule .
three ethnic albanian brothers from macedonia were convicted to life in prison in 2008 on charges of plotting to attack the us army 's fort dix military base in new jersey .
a fourth member of the group from kosovo was sentenced to five years in jail .
across the balkans , minority wahhabi groups seek to convert mainstream islam to their more militant interpretation through the operation of cultural centers , mosques , schools and at times by battling for control of majority muslim organizations and community-owned property .
a majority of the region 's muslims are secular and analysts caution against overstating the wahhabi threat .
" it should not be ignored , but neither should it be exaggerated , " said hajrudin somun a former bosnian ambassador to turkey and history professor at sarajevo 's philip noel-baker international university .
the analysts say militant islam is gaining ground on the fringe of a more general return to religion in the balkans .
several thousand orthodox christian bulgarians demonstrated in sofia recently demanding that religious instruction be made compulsory in schools - a demand supported by mainstream muslim organizations .
muslim organizations are believed to have spent large amounts of money over the last decade to build some 150 new mosques and educational centers in predominantly orthodox bulgaria .
a minority are believed to promote wahhabism .
analysts say that radical islam has gained ground in southern and northeastern bulgaria where militant islamists , according to former bulgarian chief mufti nedim gendzhev , are seeking to create a " fundamentalist triangle " in areas of bosnia , macedonia and bulgaria 's western rhodope mountains .
fears of increasing radicalism bulgarian authorities last year arrested a mayor and a village teacher in the south of the country on charges of preaching radical islam .
in 2003 , authorities shut down several islamic centers because they were financed by saudi-funded muslim groups believed to have links to militant islamic organizations and " to prevent terrorists getting a foothold in bulgaria . "
some analysts estimate that 3,000 young muslims have graduated from militant schools still operating in bulgaria ; it was not immediately clear what they went on to do following their graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations are tense between muslims and serbs in bosnia the threat posed by the wahhabis is a major bone of contention in tense relations between muslims and serbs in bosnia , which so far has successfully neutralized wahhabi influence by controlling the appointment of imams in mosques and teachers at islamic educational institutions and employing law enforcement .
some bosnian wahhabis , estimated to number 3,000 , are former foreign fighters who married bosnian women and stayed in the country after the bosnian war that ended in 1995 .
bosnia recently stepped up its fight against militancy and organized crime to meet an eu requirement for visa-free travel for bosnians and closer ties with the bloc .
in early september , bosnian police uncovered a cache of weapons and detained a third suspect as part of their inquiry into a june bomb attack that killed one policeman and injured six others .
the attack on a police station in the town of bugojno was one of the most serious security incidents in bosnia .
police arrested the suspected mastermind and an aide shortly after the blast .
bosnia tries to crackdown on militants boris grubesic , a spokesman for the bosnian prosecutor 's office , told reporters in mid-september that prosecutors were investigating several people from bugojno and gornja maoca on suspicion of wahhabi ties , terrorism and human trafficking .
in february , bosnian and eu police raided gornja maoca and arrested seven men described as wahhabis because of their beards and shortened trousers .
police said they were detained for suspected illegal possession of arms and threatening the country 's " territorial integrity , constitutional order and provoking inter-ethnic and religious hatred . " gornja maoca was home to some 30 families who lived by strict shariah laws , organized schooling in arabic for their children outside the state system and opposed the primacy of bosnia 's mainstream islamic community .
nusret imamovic , the town 's self-proclaimed wahhabi leader , endorsed suicide attacks on the group 's bosnian language website , saying they should be launched only in " exceptional circumstances . "
the site features statements by al-qaeda and islamic groups fighting in the caucasus and celebrates suicide bombers as joyful muslims .
serbian officials say 12 alleged wahhabis convicted last year to prison terms of up to 13 years for planning terrorist attacks , including on the us embassy in belgrade , had close ties to their brethren in gornja maoca .
one of the convicted , adnan hot , said during the trial that imamovic was one of only three muslim leaders that he followed .
four other wahhabis were sentenced in a separate case to jail terms of up to eight years on charges of planning to bomb a football stadium in the southern serbian town of novi pazar .
in macedonia , suleyman rexhepim rexhepi , head of the official islamic religious community -lrb- ivz -rrb- , recently called on the government and the international community to crack down on increasingly influential wahabbi groups .
rexhepi is locked into a bitter battle with ramadan ramadani , the imam of the isa beg mosque in skopje , that has caused a rift in the country 's muslim community .
ramadani accuses rexhep of financial msmangement and is seeking his ouster .
he organized a petition signed by thousands of his followers supporting his bid for leadership of the community after rexhepi banned him from organizing prayers .
ramadani denies that wahhabis are active among macedonian muslims who account for roughly one quarter of the population as well as allegations that the pro-bin laden music video was played in mosques he controls .
a ramadani associate , radical kosovo imam sefket krasnici , shocked macedonians , when he recently denounced mother teresa , a native of skopje whom many consider a saint , during a sermon in the macedonian capital .
" she belongs in the middle of hell because she did not believe in allah , the prophet and the koran ...
even if she believed in god her belief was incomplete , with deficiencies .
god does not accept such worship , " krasnici said .

however , one city in the southern state of bavaria , oberstaufen , has publicly supported google street view - and may be the only city in the country that has supported the company to such a great degree .
in an interview with deutsche welle , bianca keybach , the head of oberstaufen 's tourist office , explained why the city even went so far as to bake for google .
deutsche welle : oberstaufen made a video and even baked a cake for google .
is that right ? bianca keybach : yes , we made a cake for google to welcome them and we put it into our facebook fan page and afterward we sent an invitation to google to say that we would be glad to welcome them here , and then google contacted us and we will see what happens .
when google contacted you , what happened ?
they were thankful for being so positive because this was a very big discussion in germany , -lsb- due to privacy -rsb- and taking pictures and everybody says we do n't want that .
we were one of the towns that said we would like -lsb- street view -rsb- .
tell me why you want google taking street view photographs in your town ?
what do you hope to accomplish other than to show how great the town is ?
i think that it would be an additional service for our guests .
when they are choosing a hotel or reading our brochures or they look at our homepage and they ca n't really say if everything is true , if there is a big street next to the hotel .
with google street view they can look into the town and discover the street , discover the region and after the holidays they can show their family and friends where they have been and what they can recommend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bianca keybach is the head of oberstaufen 's tourism office google has sent out their street view vehicles to big cities around germany , and they 're going to be releasing the photos for the 20 biggest cities around germany later this year .
have they actually sent a car to oberstaufen ?
they 've been here last year or at the beginning of this year .
they were in oberstaufen .
nobody saw them , though .
they took pictures and they have them and we 'll all waiting if there 's any chance that we can go on street view as soon as possible .
some have argued against street view because they say criminals could use it to plan robberies .
do you think that 's a valid argument ?
that 's a very interesting argument , because it 's one of the most important arguments for the critics but i think it 's crazy because the pictures were taken five or 10 months ago and they will be online for five or 10 years .
but if i want to get into a house and commit a crime , i wo n't use a picture that is many years old .
i could just use a postcard , for example , as a basis for burglary .
i think that 's not very realistic , but it 's very nice for a symbolic discussion .
are you surprised that there have n't been more cities that have welcomed google like oberstaufen has ?
i was not surprised because usually in germany you wait -lsb- to not draw attention to yourself -rsb- .
as long as you 're waiting , nobody is criticizing you .
i think it 's german , and it 's normal that no other towns really said , " we like google and we welcome google and we see a lot of positive aspects in this theme . "
after we said we like google and we support google street view , in our region , other towns and villages said , " we like would like to have them here , but you have to be the pioneer . "
we are glad that we decided to be very open .
now you mentioned earlier that you sent google a cake .
what kind of cake was it ?
i think it was a chocolate cake that was covered in frosting .
we just took a picture of the cake and sent the picture by e-mail , by twitter and we put it on facebook and we sent a real invitation that as soon as they come to take the other pictures of oberstaufen we will welcome them with the original cake .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.10.2010 germany 's khedira has gone from backup to bulwark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was germany 's heart and soul against turkey as a defensive stopper , sami khedira does n't post the sort of numbers that leap out at you from score sheets .
but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

but not all germans are happy that their homes , cars and even themselves could be online for all to see . some 1 million germans make use of the street view service daily for a virtual ground 's eye look of the world , according to google .
but the company has been heavily criticized in germany as it gets ready to put maps of german cities online , which the company plans to do by the end of the year .
much of that criticism has come from the southern german state of bavaria , and the region around the city of ingolstadt in particular .
" the problem with google street view is that google - without asking - has gone and photographed german houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used , " georg schaeff , the publisher of the ingolstadt-based daily donaukurier , told deutsche welle .
the newspaper has publicized local opposition to the service for the last two years .
that 's a problem in germany since the country 's highest court has affirmed citizens ' rights to control who has their personal information and how it 's used .
google gives ground " we take privacy very seriously , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service . "
the california tech giant has made concessions to german privacy advocates by allowing material to be made unrecognizable before being published , which it has n't done in the other 23 countries street view is online .
furthermore , after facing widespread criticism , it doubled the opt-out period to eight weeks , which ends on friday .
some 200,000 people have taken google up on the offer to have their homes or apartment building blurred , according to a report in the german news magazine der spiegel .
google , which automatically blurs the faces and vehicle license plates its computer can recognize and asks users to point out the ones it misses , has not commented on the number of opt-out it has received .
bildunterschrift : some 200,000 people have removed themselves from street view , a german magazine reported but schaeff said people have no way of making sure what they see as a violation of their privacy really gets deleted .
he added that citizens have little recourse if google does n't agree with their claim of a privacy infringement by the panoramic photos of whatever is visible from the street taken by the eight cameras mounted on the company 's car .
" individual citizens ca n't assert themselves against these kinds of companies , " he said .
" and the corporations do n't bother to consider if what they are doing is illegal or not .
google works on the premise of ' why ask for permission when you can beg for forgiveness after the fact ? " '
privacy rift but privacy advocates still have a lot of convincing to do .
some 41 percent of germans see more positive than negative aspects to street view and 16 percent say they have or will remove their homes from the service , according to an august study by the emnid research institute .
many ingolstadt locals agreed with the poll 's sentiment .
" google can go ahead and do it , because everyone leaves their tracks all over the internet and everywhere else , " said ingo zingel , an ingolstadt resident .
" whether someone takes a picture of the door to my house really does n't matter . "
schaeff said he 's not surprised that some people do n't seem concerned about what 's happening to their personal information .
" i think there is a rift in society where half the people do n't see a problem and do n't know what 's coming down the road , " he said .
" the other half is much more sensitive and is more careful because the situation is far from clear . "
what 's unclear , he added , is how images from street view - or any other type of geodata , such as that collected by mobile phone providers - can be used to create profiles of individuals that are later sold to third parties .
without knowing how personal data will be used , he said people should give out as little as possible .
" each piece of personal information is like a stone that creates a mosaic , " schaeff said .
" every little stone plays a meaningful role , but , unfortunately , you ca n't tell what the role is until the whole picture has been made . "
' sensible areas ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 41 percent germans said street view has more positive than negative aspects but there are some pictures thomas herker , the mayor of pfaffenhofen , just south of ingolstadt , said he knows he does n't want made .
while he insisted that city hall and pubic offices be visible in street view , he added that some public buildings should be unrecognizable on the internet .
" we requested that google remove public kindergartens and schools , " he said referring to a letter the city sent in december 2009 to google 's german headquarters in hamburg .
" two weeks ago we were told they would not do it because only private individuals - not municipalities - have a right to remove property . "
herker led a group of bavarian mayors which sent another request to google asking for the company to respect their wishes and remove kindergartens and other " sensible areas " from street view .
while herker is left hoping google accounts for his city 's wishes , the point may become moot if the service goes online as planned by the end of the year .
the last time herker wrote to google it took 10 months to get a form letter response .
if it takes that long again the pictures will have long been online for all to see .
" there are three companies in germany that , in my opinion , are problematic : deutsche telekom , deutsche bahn , and now i 've added google to the list , " he said .
" i can only hope that google will change its mind and make it possible to remove public property from the service . "

but not all germans are happy that their homes , cars and even themselves could be online for all to see . some 1 million germans make use of the street view service daily for a virtual ground 's eye look of the world , according to google .
but the company has been heavily criticized in germany as it gets ready to put maps of german cities online , which the company plans to do by the end of the year .
much of that criticism has come from the southern german state of bavaria , and the region around the city of ingolstadt in particular .
" the problem with google street view is that google - without asking - has gone and photographed german houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used , " georg schaeff , the publisher of the ingolstadt-based daily donaukurier , told deutsche welle .
the newspaper has publicized local opposition to the service for the last two years .
that 's a problem in germany since the country 's highest court has affirmed citizens ' rights to control who has their personal information and how it 's used .
google gives ground " we take privacy very seriously , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service . "
the california tech giant has made concessions to german privacy advocates by allowing material to be made unrecognizable before being published , which it has n't done in the other 23 countries street view is online .
furthermore , after facing widespread criticism , it doubled the opt-out period to eight weeks , which ends on friday .
some 200,000 people have taken google up on the offer to have their homes or apartment building blurred , according to a report in the german news magazine der spiegel .
google , which automatically blurs the faces and vehicle license plates its computer can recognize and asks users to point out the ones it misses , has not commented on the number of opt-out it has received .
bildunterschrift : some 200,000 people have removed themselves from street view , a german magazine reported but schaeff said people have no way of making sure what they see as a violation of their privacy really gets deleted .
he added that citizens have little recourse if google does n't agree with their claim of a privacy infringement by the panoramic photos of whatever is visible from the street taken by the eight cameras mounted on the company 's car .
" individual citizens ca n't assert themselves against these kinds of companies , " he said .
" and the corporations do n't bother to consider if what they are doing is illegal or not .
google works on the premise of ' why ask for permission when you can beg for forgiveness after the fact ? " '
privacy rift but privacy advocates still have a lot of convincing to do .
some 41 percent of germans see more positive than negative aspects to street view and 16 percent say they have or will remove their homes from the service , according to an august study by the emnid research institute .
many ingolstadt locals agreed with the poll 's sentiment .
" google can go ahead and do it , because everyone leaves their tracks all over the internet and everywhere else , " said ingo zingel , an ingolstadt resident .
" whether someone takes a picture of the door to my house really does n't matter . "
schaeff said he 's not surprised that some people do n't seem concerned about what 's happening to their personal information .
" i think there is a rift in society where half the people do n't see a problem and do n't know what 's coming down the road , " he said .
" the other half is much more sensitive and is more careful because the situation is far from clear . "
what 's unclear , he added , is how images from street view - or any other type of geodata , such as that collected by mobile phone providers - can be used to create profiles of individuals that are later sold to third parties .
without knowing how personal data will be used , he said people should give out as little as possible .
" each piece of personal information is like a stone that creates a mosaic , " schaeff said .
" every little stone plays a meaningful role , but , unfortunately , you ca n't tell what the role is until the whole picture has been made . "
' sensible areas ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 41 percent germans said street view has more positive than negative aspects but there are some pictures thomas herker , the mayor of pfaffenhofen , just south of ingolstadt , said he knows he does n't want made .
while he insisted that city hall and pubic offices be visible in street view , he added that some public buildings should be unrecognizable on the internet .
" we requested that google remove public kindergartens and schools , " he said referring to a letter the city sent in december 2009 to google 's german headquarters in hamburg .
" two weeks ago we were told they would not do it because only private individuals - not municipalities - have a right to remove property . "
herker led a group of bavarian mayors which sent another request to google asking for the company to respect their wishes and remove kindergartens and other " sensible areas " from street view .
while herker is left hoping google accounts for his city 's wishes , the point may become moot if the service goes online as planned by the end of the year .
the last time herker wrote to google it took 10 months to get a form letter response .
if it takes that long again the pictures will have long been online for all to see .
" there are three companies in germany that , in my opinion , are problematic : deutsche telekom , deutsche bahn , and now i 've added google to the list , " he said .
" i can only hope that google will change its mind and make it possible to remove public property from the service . "

"
he is hoping his visit will help promote “ sensible arrangements . ”
but observers are skeptical . economics minister rainer bruederle has framed his two-day trip to china , which began in beijing on tuesday , as a pacifying mission , following recent acrimony between china and many g-20 countries over trade .
" the danger of a trade war has appeared on the horizon , " bruederle told reporters traveling with him on his two-day trip to china , which is to include stops in beijing and shanghai .
the minister warned that accusations of currency manipulation should not be allowed to escalate , and protectionism must be avoided .
some of china 's trading partners in the us and europe have recently accused beijing of allowing the yuan to depreciate at a faster pace .
critics say the unit could be undervalued by as much as 40 percent .
ambassador and missionary speaking in beijing , bruederle refuted these claims , pointing out that the yuan had increased in value by 15 to 17 percent in the past two years , and he added that he did not expect the chinese government to adopt flexible trading patterns in the future .
" we must not allow the situation to get out of hand , or turn our backs on free trade , " bruederle said , adding that he saw himself as an " ambassador , perhaps even a missionary , for the fight against protectionism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has faced pressure from the eu over currency depreciation bruederle expressed satisfaction with the state of german-chinese trade , which has grown significantly this year .
german exports to china have grown by 52 percent to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of this year , while chinese exports have risen by 34 percent , compared to 2009 figures .
germany is considered one of china 's best friends in the west .
" the germans have been pushing for an open trade policy towards china , " jonathan holslag of the brussels institute of contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" germany 's economic revival after the financial crisis has been - to a large degree - made in china . "
" most of the expansion in germany 's exports – particularly cars and machinery – has been bound for china , " says holslag .
for this reason , holslag believes , the german government has often cautioned against protectionism towards china .
" angela merkel has also openly expressed her support for granting china market economy status , " holslag points out .
" this would make it more difficult for the european commission to apply anti-dumping procedures . "
good on the small-scale , not so much on the large-scale but despite germany 's huge economic interest in china – not only through exports , but also through direct investment from individual companies – bruederle 's leverage during this trip is likely to be limited .
the minister said that one of his main aims for the trip was to ensure that medium-sized german businesses gained better opportunities in china .
after his meetings with chinese commerce minister chen deming and zhang ping , the head of the country 's top economic planning agency , bruederle said he had been assured that german companies could take part in open competition in china provided they used a minimum of 50 percent local products .
but holslag believes this is a secondary priority for bruederle compared to maintaining export agreements .
" it 's important to distinguish degrees of urgency , " he says .
" the most important objective for the german government is to step up exports , and the second level is access to the chinese market .
germany is likely to be very cautious in negotiations , in order to protect exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery has been largely based on exports to china but despite this , there is concern that german companies are being disadvantaged by the chinese government .
rolf langhammer , vice-president of the kiel institute for the world economy , believes that this is where bruederle can at least make sure german businesses can get their voices heard .
" germany enjoys a very good position in china compared to other european countries , but of course there are barriers to mid-sized german companies , " he told deutsche welle .
" a lot of representatives of these firms are accompanying bruederle . "
langhammer does not think that bruederle can apply much pressure on the question of global exchange rates – the issue he addressed on arrival .
" the chinese government has always made clear that it wo n't let itself be influenced on this subject , and bruederle 's visit wo n't change anything in the discussion about the exchange rate . "
langhammer is also unconvinced by bruederle 's attempt to position himself as a mediator between the china and the west .
" that 's a role he can not play , " he says .
" he is much too small for that .
he does n't speak for the eurozone , he speaks for an export country called germany .
of course he can represent the interests of mid-sized companies , and he can voice their concerns if they feel themselves disadvantaged alongside chinese competition , but he ca n't solve the big questions – and he ca n't be a mediator in them . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.10.2010 germany 's khedira has gone from backup to bulwark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was germany 's heart and soul against turkey as a defensive stopper , sami khedira does n't post the sort of numbers that leap out at you from score sheets .
but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.10.2010 germany 's khedira has gone from backup to bulwark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was germany 's heart and soul against turkey as a defensive stopper , sami khedira does n't post the sort of numbers that leap out at you from score sheets .
but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

"
he is hoping his visit will help promote “ sensible arrangements . ”
but observers are skeptical . economics minister rainer bruederle has framed his two-day trip to china , which began in beijing on tuesday , as a pacifying mission , following recent acrimony between china and many g-20 countries over trade .
" the danger of a trade war has appeared on the horizon , " bruederle told reporters traveling with him on his two-day trip to china , which is to include stops in beijing and shanghai .
the minister warned that accusations of currency manipulation should not be allowed to escalate , and protectionism must be avoided .
some of china 's trading partners in the us and europe have recently accused beijing of allowing the yuan to depreciate at a faster pace .
critics say the unit could be undervalued by as much as 40 percent .
ambassador and missionary speaking in beijing , bruederle refuted these claims , pointing out that the yuan had increased in value by 15 to 17 percent in the past two years , and he added that he did not expect the chinese government to adopt flexible trading patterns in the future .
" we must not allow the situation to get out of hand , or turn our backs on free trade , " bruederle said , adding that he saw himself as an " ambassador , perhaps even a missionary , for the fight against protectionism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has faced pressure from the eu over currency depreciation bruederle expressed satisfaction with the state of german-chinese trade , which has grown significantly this year .
german exports to china have grown by 52 percent to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of this year , while chinese exports have risen by 34 percent , compared to 2009 figures .
germany is considered one of china 's best friends in the west .
" the germans have been pushing for an open trade policy towards china , " jonathan holslag of the brussels institute of contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" germany 's economic revival after the financial crisis has been - to a large degree - made in china . "
" most of the expansion in germany 's exports – particularly cars and machinery – has been bound for china , " says holslag .
for this reason , holslag believes , the german government has often cautioned against protectionism towards china .
" angela merkel has also openly expressed her support for granting china market economy status , " holslag points out .
" this would make it more difficult for the european commission to apply anti-dumping procedures . "
good on the small-scale , not so much on the large-scale but despite germany 's huge economic interest in china – not only through exports , but also through direct investment from individual companies – bruederle 's leverage during this trip is likely to be limited .
the minister said that one of his main aims for the trip was to ensure that medium-sized german businesses gained better opportunities in china .
after his meetings with chinese commerce minister chen deming and zhang ping , the head of the country 's top economic planning agency , bruederle said he had been assured that german companies could take part in open competition in china provided they used a minimum of 50 percent local products .
but holslag believes this is a secondary priority for bruederle compared to maintaining export agreements .
" it 's important to distinguish degrees of urgency , " he says .
" the most important objective for the german government is to step up exports , and the second level is access to the chinese market .
germany is likely to be very cautious in negotiations , in order to protect exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery has been largely based on exports to china but despite this , there is concern that german companies are being disadvantaged by the chinese government .
rolf langhammer , vice-president of the kiel institute for the world economy , believes that this is where bruederle can at least make sure german businesses can get their voices heard .
" germany enjoys a very good position in china compared to other european countries , but of course there are barriers to mid-sized german companies , " he told deutsche welle .
" a lot of representatives of these firms are accompanying bruederle . "
langhammer does not think that bruederle can apply much pressure on the question of global exchange rates – the issue he addressed on arrival .
" the chinese government has always made clear that it wo n't let itself be influenced on this subject , and bruederle 's visit wo n't change anything in the discussion about the exchange rate . "
langhammer is also unconvinced by bruederle 's attempt to position himself as a mediator between the china and the west .
" that 's a role he can not play , " he says .
" he is much too small for that .
he does n't speak for the eurozone , he speaks for an export country called germany .
of course he can represent the interests of mid-sized companies , and he can voice their concerns if they feel themselves disadvantaged alongside chinese competition , but he ca n't solve the big questions – and he ca n't be a mediator in them . "

" learn german !
adjust to the customs of your host country , " he told daily newspaper bild in an interview published on tuesday .
" you do n't have to give up the gift of your identity and culture , but rather think of yourselves as ambassadors for turkey .
only then can you build bridges for a better friendship and partnership between our countries . "
three days before his comments were published , german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan met in berlin on the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between the two countries , pledging to cooperate more on integration of turks living in germany .
multi-faceted integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to work together on integration ines michalowski , a senior researcher at berlin 's social science research center , said the call for turkish-germans to maintain their culture while still adjusting to german customs may seem paradoxical , but that the two are not mutually exclusive .
" the turkish nation-state is a very nationalistic nation , where there are actually claims of turks belonging to the turkish nation-state even though they have been living abroad for several generations , " she told deutsche welle .
" but that does n't mean that integration on the labor market , or in the educational system , or contacts with germans - that these aspects of integration go badly . "
still , research shows that most turkish germans are poorly integrated in these areas - a fact which haci halil uslucan , director of the center for turkish studies and integration research , said can not be entirely attributed to a perceived lack of motivation of immigrants to integrate themselves .
" i think we also have to focus on the conditions of being integrated - and that means the attitudes of the majority , the look of the majority on the minority , " he told deutsche welle .
" the political discussion should not go in this direction of creating ranks - these are the good immigrants and these are the bad ones .
that only increases social tension . "
education is key bagis also said in his interview that turkish-german parents should send their children " to the best schools , so that they have a future , " echoing comments by prime minister erdogan that turkish-germans should prioritize education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research shows other minorities have integrated better than turks michalowski said studies of vietnamese immigrant parents in the eastern state of brandenburg have shown their children to have higher high-school graduation and college entrance rates than non-immigrant german children , partly because the parents place a high priority on education .

" learn german !
adjust to the customs of your host country , " he told daily newspaper bild in an interview published on tuesday .
" you do n't have to give up the gift of your identity and culture , but rather think of yourselves as ambassadors for turkey .
only then can you build bridges for a better friendship and partnership between our countries . "
three days before his comments were published , german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan met in berlin on the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between the two countries , pledging to cooperate more on integration of turks living in germany .
multi-faceted integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to work together on integration ines michalowski , a senior researcher at berlin 's social science research center , said the call for turkish-germans to maintain their culture while still adjusting to german customs may seem paradoxical , but that the two are not mutually exclusive .
" the turkish nation-state is a very nationalistic nation , where there are actually claims of turks belonging to the turkish nation-state even though they have been living abroad for several generations , " she told deutsche welle .
" but that does n't mean that integration on the labor market , or in the educational system , or contacts with germans - that these aspects of integration go badly . "
still , research shows that most turkish germans are poorly integrated in these areas - a fact which haci halil uslucan , director of the center for turkish studies and integration research , said can not be entirely attributed to a perceived lack of motivation of immigrants to integrate themselves .
" i think we also have to focus on the conditions of being integrated - and that means the attitudes of the majority , the look of the majority on the minority , " he told deutsche welle .
" the political discussion should not go in this direction of creating ranks - these are the good immigrants and these are the bad ones .
that only increases social tension . "
education is key bagis also said in his interview that turkish-german parents should send their children " to the best schools , so that they have a future , " echoing comments by prime minister erdogan that turkish-germans should prioritize education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research shows other minorities have integrated better than turks michalowski said studies of vietnamese immigrant parents in the eastern state of brandenburg have shown their children to have higher high-school graduation and college entrance rates than non-immigrant german children , partly because the parents place a high priority on education .
" some of the criticism has been that maybe turkish parents are not putting enough emphasis on getting a good education within germany , " she said .
" so if there is a government official from turkey who actually encourages people to pay more attention to the education of their children , i think that can never do any harm . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 12.10.2010 eu searches for answers in roma integration debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some roma have been deported back to romania from france integrating roma in european countries has proven to be difficult , but experts at an eu conference are trying to find solutions .
the two-day conference is being held in the romanian capital , bucharest . european union officials , romanian politicians and roma representatives are discussing integration issues regarding europe 's roma population at a two-day eu conference held in romania 's capital , bucharest .
the conference is aimed at finding solutions on how to achieve more with the money spent by the european union on integrating roma , said the european commissioner for employment and social affairs , laszlo andor , at the opening of the conference .
" a lot has been done in terms of strategic planning , coordination and implementation , but at the end of the day , not much has really changed . " he said .
andor wants eu member states to become more engaged in integrating their roma population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " not much has really changed " - andor said at the conference " the eu can not solve the multi-layered problems of the roma by itself , " he said .
" the european union is ready to step up its efforts for roma integration , but that is also what we expect from all member states . "
funding is available , yet few members take the money even though the european union has funds available , member states refrain from using the money .
from 2007 until 2013 , the european social fund offered 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.1 billion -rrb- to help finance education and housing projects for roma .
especially countries with a high number of roma population like hungary , bulgaria and romania were expected make use of the funds .
the eu has installed a task force in order to find out why member states do not act even though the funds are available .
the task force is expected to present its results by the end of this year .
hungarian prime minister viktor orban said that the integration of roma would be one of the main focuses in hungary 's term in the eu presidency beginning in january .
according to andor , france 's drastic measures of expelling thousands of roma were " very unfortunate " , but " ironically energized the discussions on roma inclusion . "
problem of roma integration will not affect schengen talks german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting romanian prime minister emil boc that the problem of roma integration would not affect negotiations on romania becoming part of the schengen zone .
being a country within the schengen treaty would give romanian citizen visa-free travel within the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a long way from the end of the road , " - according to chancellor merkel merkel said that germany would judge romania 's development on their way to the schengen treaty fairly - but did not promise a quick entrance to the schengen zone .
" the reforms of the judiciary and of interior affairs are being tackled very courageously , but you are still a long way from the end of the road , " merkel said . " we back romania 's efforts to join the schengen zone ... but we must make sure that visa delivery procedures are not marred by corruption , " she said .
it is crucial that romania only issue visas without signs of corruption or unregularities and that eu 's external borders are safe .
" there are no reasonable alternatives to transparent and clear legal terms . " romania is hoping to enter the schengen zone in the middle of 2011 .
the country has been a member of the eu since 2007 .
most of europe 's roma are said to live in romania , but there are no reliable numbers - with figures ranging from a population of 530,000 up to 2.5 million .

the kazakhs held die mannschaft for the first 45 minutes of the encounter , but were unable to stem the germans ’ flow of attacking football in the second half .
the first goal came from miroslav klose , who , finding the net for the third time in two games , slotted home three minutes after the break .
substitute mario gomez added a second goal in the 78th minute and lukas podolski put the final touch on the score line five minutes from fulltime .
the victory puts germany at the top of their group on 12 points , five clear of their nearest rival austria , who played out a thrilling 4-4 draw with belgium in tuesday 's late game .
the loss leaves kazakhstan bottom of the group with zero points .
germany coach joachim loew said that he was pleased with the result : " we achieved what we wanted to do , but obviously some errors occurred . "
" we have 12 points .
that is what we wanted , so i have to be satisfied .
what the team managed to achieve this year has been great , i ca n't expect them to be brilliant in every game , " he said .
" we have a lead at the top and that is comfortable , but we still need to win a few games before we can plan for the finals . "
in the third group a game played tuesday , azerbaijan pulled off a shock 1-0 win at home over a much-fancied turkey , who earlier in the week had gone down to germany in berlin .
the euro 2012 championships are to be held in poland and ukraine .

however , one city in the southern state of bavaria , oberstaufen , has publicly supported google street view - and may be the only city in the country that has supported the company to such a great degree .
in an interview with deutsche welle , bianca keybach , the head of oberstaufen 's tourist office , explained why the city even went so far as to bake for google .
deutsche welle : oberstaufen made a video and even baked a cake for google .
is that right ? bianca keybach : yes , we made a cake for google to welcome them and we put it into our facebook fan page and afterward we sent an invitation to google to say that we would be glad to welcome them here , and then google contacted us and we will see what happens .
when google contacted you , what happened ?
they were thankful for being so positive because this was a very big discussion in germany , -lsb- due to privacy -rsb- and taking pictures and everybody says we do n't want that .
we were one of the towns that said we would like -lsb- street view -rsb- .
tell me why you want google taking street view photographs in your town ?
what do you hope to accomplish other than to show how great the town is ?
i think that it would be an additional service for our guests .
when they are choosing a hotel or reading our brochures or they look at our homepage and they ca n't really say if everything is true , if there is a big street next to the hotel .
with google street view they can look into the town and discover the street , discover the region and after the holidays they can show their family and friends where they have been and what they can recommend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bianca keybach is the head of oberstaufen 's tourism office google has sent out their street view vehicles to big cities around germany , and they 're going to be releasing the photos for the 20 biggest cities around germany later this year .
have they actually sent a car to oberstaufen ?
they 've been here last year or at the beginning of this year .
they were in oberstaufen .
nobody saw them , though .
they took pictures and they have them and we 'll all waiting if there 's any chance that we can go on street view as soon as possible .
some have argued against street view because they say criminals could use it to plan robberies .
do you think that 's a valid argument ?
that 's a very interesting argument , because it 's one of the most important arguments for the critics but i think it 's crazy because the pictures were taken five or 10 months ago and they will be online for five or 10 years .
but if i want to get into a house and commit a crime , i wo n't use a picture that is many years old .
i could just use a postcard , for example , as a basis for burglary .
i think that 's not very realistic , but it 's very nice for a symbolic discussion .
are you surprised that there have n't been more cities that have welcomed google like oberstaufen has ?
i was not surprised because usually in germany you wait -lsb- to not draw attention to yourself -rsb- .
as long as you 're waiting , nobody is criticizing you .
i think it 's german , and it 's normal that no other towns really said , " we like google and we welcome google and we see a lot of positive aspects in this theme . "
after we said we like google and we support google street view , in our region , other towns and villages said , " we like would like to have them here , but you have to be the pioneer . "
we are glad that we decided to be very open .
now you mentioned earlier that you sent google a cake .
what kind of cake was it ?
i think it was a chocolate cake that was covered in frosting .
we just took a picture of the cake and sent the picture by e-mail , by twitter and we put it on facebook and we sent a real invitation that as soon as they come to take the other pictures of oberstaufen we will welcome them with the original cake .

in an interview with deutsche welle , bianca keybach , the head of oberstaufen 's tourist office , explained why the city even went so far as to bake for google .
deutsche welle : oberstaufen made a video and even baked a cake for google .
is that right ? bianca keybach : yes , we made a cake for google to welcome them and we put it into our facebook fan page and afterward we sent an invitation to google to say that we would be glad to welcome them here , and then google contacted us and we will see what happens .
when google contacted you , what happened ?
they were thankful for being so positive because this was a very big discussion in germany , -lsb- due to privacy -rsb- and taking pictures and everybody says we do n't want that .
we were one of the towns that said we would like -lsb- street view -rsb- .
tell me why you want google taking street view photographs in your town ?
what do you hope to accomplish other than to show how great the town is ?
i think that it would be an additional service for our guests .
when they are choosing a hotel or reading our brochures or they look at our homepage and they ca n't really say if everything is true , if there is a big street next to the hotel .
with google street view they can look into the town and discover the street , discover the region and after the holidays they can show their family and friends where they have been and what they can recommend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bianca keybach is the head of oberstaufen 's tourism office google has sent out their street view vehicles to big cities around germany , and they 're going to be releasing the photos for the 20 biggest cities around germany later this year .
have they actually sent a car to oberstaufen ?
they 've been here last year or at the beginning of this year .
they were in oberstaufen .
nobody saw them , though .
they took pictures and they have them and we 'll all waiting if there 's any chance that we can go on street view as soon as possible .
some have argued against street view because they say criminals could use it to plan robberies .
do you think that 's a valid argument ?
that 's a very interesting argument , because it 's one of the most important arguments for the critics but i think it 's crazy because the pictures were taken five or 10 months ago and they will be online for five or 10 years .
but if i want to get into a house and commit a crime , i wo n't use a picture that is many years old .
i could just use a postcard , for example , as a basis for burglary .
i think that 's not very realistic , but it 's very nice for a symbolic discussion .
are you surprised that there have n't been more cities that have welcomed google like oberstaufen has ?
i was not surprised because usually in germany you wait -lsb- to not draw attention to yourself -rsb- .
as long as you 're waiting , nobody is criticizing you .
i think it 's german , and it 's normal that no other towns really said , " we like google and we welcome google and we see a lot of positive aspects in this theme . "
after we said we like google and we support google street view , in our region , other towns and villages said , " we like would like to have them here , but you have to be the pioneer . "
we are glad that we decided to be very open .
now you mentioned earlier that you sent google a cake .
what kind of cake was it ?
i think it was a chocolate cake that was covered in frosting .
we just took a picture of the cake and sent the picture by e-mail , by twitter and we put it on facebook and we sent a real invitation that as soon as they come to take the other pictures of oberstaufen we will welcome them with the original cake .

europe 's social affairs commissioner said financial help is available to member states . the european commission will once again push member states to do more to improve the situation for roma travelers on tuesday at a conference in bucharest .
the meeting was organized after the french government began its deportations of roma families over the summer , drawing international criticism .
the bucharest conference aims to promote the better use of eu funds to improve the socio-economic situation of the 10 to 12 million roma living on the continent .
they face discrimination , poverty , segregation , and barriers to education and the labor market in many of the european countries in which they settle .
in slovakia , for example , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education .
in bulgaria , over 50 percent of roma are unemployed .
in romania only about a quarter of roma have a steady job .
european funds are under-used in recent years the european union has brought in a comprehensive financial program to promote the integration of the roma and sinti travelers .
but romania and bulgaria , the eu member states with the biggest roma communities , have made little use of the subsidies .
despite the high-profile debate about integration of roma sparked by france 's crackdown on its traveling community , the european union 's commissioner for social affairs and inclusion complained recently that few nations are drawing on the available financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laszlo andor wants countries to make better use of european funds " i would like to stress that this is the responsibility of the european union and the member states together , " andor said in the european parliament .
" the structural funds offer a very useful financial lever for supporting national efforts to improve the situation of the roma .
however , eu funds are often not fully used , or not used in the most effective way . "
currently romania is only using 1 percent of the 2.25 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- made available by the european social fund between 2007 and 2013 to improve the situation of vulnerable groups .
bulgaria is only using 5 percent of the fund .
integration is not just about money however , there is of course no compulsion to use the money .
the german conservative mep manfred weber hopes there is enough incentive for countries to apply for the money if they need it .
" the decisive factor in integration of course is always that it ca n't be proscribed from above , rather it 's got to happen in the towns , in the communities themselves , " weber told deutsche welle .
" it demands creativity . "
the european commission has set up a working group to assess why the roma struggle so much with integration .
the group will deliver its findings by the end of the year .
in the meantime andor wants member states to set ambitious targets for tackling poverty and improving the educational horizons of the roma .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in slovakia , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education " it 's only about poverty reduction , it 's not only about social inclusion , " the commissioner said .
" we have to ensure that the roma are explicitly mentioned in our new employment flagship initiative , because that 's also where a breakthrough has to be made . "
manfred weber believes governments have to tackle the root of the problem by targeting education .
“ we have to follow through the idea that children of this ethnic minority must attend school .
only then can we succeed in truly integrating these travelling families into european societies . ”
the problems for the roma in europe are not new .
there is money available in europe to tackle it .
but it has taken the row over the policy of deporting roma from france to bring this much-beleaguered community into the spotlight .

but many observers say that its chances of succeeding are less than slim . in the current format , the un general assembly annually elects five new , non-permanent security council members to two-year terms to replace the five members that will leave the council at the end of december .
the 10 rotating seats are divided among five regions around the world .
only the united states , britain , france , russia and china hold permanent seats on the un security council and the power to veto all resolutions .
germany has been campaigning to join this elite group as part of a more comprehensive project to revamp the council for most of the past decade .
along with india , japan and brazil , germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the un system as part of the g-4 alliance .
the g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
under the alliance 's plan , four of the permanent six seats would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries .
germany 's determination to pursue its goal is supported by what many see as a justified attempt to receive recognition for its contribution to the modern un and more responsibility for a country of its international standing .
" germany is a significant player at the un , " richard gowan , an international relations expert at the european council on foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the mere fact that it pays 8 percent of the budget ensures that .
germany is a constructive voice not only on iran but on issues like peace-building in africa .
it 's a good citizen at the un . "
self-preservation at the heart of opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council continues to show a reluctance to change but after facing consistent opposition to individual and collective g-4 membership , germany 's efforts and that of the alliance appeared to have lost momentum in recent years , primarily due to the growing relationship between india and the united states , which has at times diverted new delhi 's focus , and japan 's insistence on evolving a formula that can not be opposed by the us .
washington 's opposition and that of other major powers to the g-4 plan has been a major stumbling block in recent years , while the so-called " coffee club " - an alliance of pakistan , italy , mexico , argentina , south korea and several other countries opposed to the g-4 - has also emerged as a rival to complicate the g-4 's attempts at reform .
" some permanent members of the security council , like china and russia , are suspicious of any reform that would dilute their power there , " said gowan . " within europe , italy is particularly opposed to germany 's ambitions . it fears that if germany won a permanent seat alongside britain and france , its own influence at the un would decline . "
" britain and france both have a strong rhetorical commitment to germany 's cause , " he added . " however , they will do nothing that compromises their own positions on the council . in the past , germany has campaigned for a permanent seat alongside japan , india and brazil . however , it is possible to imagine scenarios in which rapidly rising powers like brazil and india won permanent seats and germany and japan did not . " g-4 allies could be both a help and hindrance to germany with india set to rejuvenate the g-4 ahead of the 65th un general assembly with a series of meetings with alliance ministers aimed at getting the campaign back on-track , germany hopes a new vigor in the group 's collective efforts to reform the council can enhance its own campaign for a permanent seat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia prefers india and brazil as permanent members " but never underestimate how complex and nasty security council reform negotiations can become , " said gowan .
" the bloc politics are fantastically difficult .
germany also has to be realistic that , while its bid for a permanent seat is taken seriously , it 's actually peripheral to the question of whether india and japan should get such seats . " " the reasons are geopolitical : if india and japan were in the council full-time , it could become a serious center for debate on asian security issues .
it 's not clear whether china wants that .
germany 's presence would probably change the dynamics of the council rather less .
but it 's very hard to imagine a reform process that gave germany a permanent seat but exclude india . that would be political and historical lunacy . " experts unconvinced that german ambitions can be fulfilled a number of experts believe that germany is wasting its time to again lobby for a permanent seat , given the rise to prominence of other states in the geo-political arena , with some saying that the unlikelihood of success or the reform of the council could even persuade chancellor angela merkel to drop the campaign completely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the un : germany may have to accept defeat " it 's very unlikely that germany will try and resurrect their bid for a seat because there really is n't any hope of getting one , " michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" should the necessary reforms go through , the un will offer seats to the likes of india and brazil over germany , due to its policy of promoting the new powers and because of the over-representation of europe on the council . " " i would be very surprised if this attempt were to be successful , " dr. karen smith at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle .
" enlarging the permanent membership of the security council is , i would think , very unlikely to happen . " " the chances of germany getting a permanent seat with a veto comparable to france or britain 's are fairly low , " richard gowan concluded .
" but it could negotiate some sort of semi-permanent seat , one which only requires reelection once every five or 10 years , without a veto .
compromises of this sort have been on the table since the 2005 negotiations on security council reform , and are probably the most realistic option .

but many observers say that its chances of succeeding are less than slim . in the current format , the un general assembly annually elects five new , non-permanent security council members to two-year terms to replace the five members that will leave the council at the end of december .
the 10 rotating seats are divided among five regions around the world .
only the united states , britain , france , russia and china hold permanent seats on the un security council and the power to veto all resolutions .
germany has been campaigning to join this elite group as part of a more comprehensive project to revamp the council for most of the past decade .
along with india , japan and brazil , germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the un system as part of the g-4 alliance .
the g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
under the alliance 's plan , four of the permanent six seats would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries .
germany 's determination to pursue its goal is supported by what many see as a justified attempt to receive recognition for its contribution to the modern un and more responsibility for a country of its international standing .
" germany is a significant player at the un , " richard gowan , an international relations expert at the european council on foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the mere fact that it pays 8 percent of the budget ensures that .
germany is a constructive voice not only on iran but on issues like peace-building in africa .
it 's a good citizen at the un . "
self-preservation at the heart of opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council continues to show a reluctance to change but after facing consistent opposition to individual and collective g-4 membership , germany 's efforts and that of the alliance appeared to have lost momentum in recent years , primarily due to the growing relationship between india and the united states , which has at times diverted new delhi 's focus , and japan 's insistence on evolving a formula that can not be opposed by the us .
washington 's opposition and that of other major powers to the g-4 plan has been a major stumbling block in recent years , while the so-called " coffee club " - an alliance of pakistan , italy , mexico , argentina , south korea and several other countries opposed to the g-4 - has also emerged as a rival to complicate the g-4 's attempts at reform .
" some permanent members of the security council , like china and russia , are suspicious of any reform that would dilute their power there , " said gowan . " within europe , italy is particularly opposed to germany 's ambitions . it fears that if germany won a permanent seat alongside britain and france , its own influence at the un would decline . "
" britain and france both have a strong rhetorical commitment to germany 's cause , " he added . " however , they will do nothing that compromises their own positions on the council . in the past , germany has campaigned for a permanent seat alongside japan , india and brazil . however , it is possible to imagine scenarios in which rapidly rising powers like brazil and india won permanent seats and germany and japan did not . " g-4 allies could be both a help and hindrance to germany with india set to rejuvenate the g-4 ahead of the 65th un general assembly with a series of meetings with alliance ministers aimed at getting the campaign back on-track , germany hopes a new vigor in the group 's collective efforts to reform the council can enhance its own campaign for a permanent seat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia prefers india and brazil as permanent members " but never underestimate how complex and nasty security council reform negotiations can become , " said gowan .
" the bloc politics are fantastically difficult .
germany also has to be realistic that , while its bid for a permanent seat is taken seriously , it 's actually peripheral to the question of whether india and japan should get such seats . " " the reasons are geopolitical : if india and japan were in the council full-time , it could become a serious center for debate on asian security issues .
it 's not clear whether china wants that .
germany 's presence would probably change the dynamics of the council rather less .
but it 's very hard to imagine a reform process that gave germany a permanent seat but exclude india . that would be political and historical lunacy . " experts unconvinced that german ambitions can be fulfilled a number of experts believe that germany is wasting its time to again lobby for a permanent seat , given the rise to prominence of other states in the geo-political arena , with some saying that the unlikelihood of success or the reform of the council could even persuade chancellor angela merkel to drop the campaign completely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the un : germany may have to accept defeat " it 's very unlikely that germany will try and resurrect their bid for a seat because there really is n't any hope of getting one , " michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" should the necessary reforms go through , the un will offer seats to the likes of india and brazil over germany , due to its policy of promoting the new powers and because of the over-representation of europe on the council . " " i would be very surprised if this attempt were to be successful , " dr. karen smith at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle .
" enlarging the permanent membership of the security council is , i would think , very unlikely to happen . " " the chances of germany getting a permanent seat with a veto comparable to france or britain 's are fairly low , " richard gowan concluded .
" but it could negotiate some sort of semi-permanent seat , one which only requires reelection once every five or 10 years , without a veto .
compromises of this sort have been on the table since the 2005 negotiations on security council reform , and are probably the most realistic option .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 12.10.2010 digital memorial to nazi victims combines technology , history and artistry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english version of memory loops contains 175 sites munich has opened a new digital monument to the victims of national socialism .
its creator , michaela melian , wanted to forge a memorial that would draw the attention of young people and pervade the city . what are memorials , and is it important that they occupy public space ?
certainly they 're a call to remembrance and reflection , but does a " digital memorial " leave out something important by letting people choose when they observe it ?
in munich , an audio map titled memory loops by artist and musician michaela melian has raised questions like these .
the project is a digital memorial to the victims of national socialism in the bavarian capital .
it draws on archival and audio footage relating to the holocaust and can be accessed online in both german and english .
melian 's project arose from a juried competition in munich seeking new forms of remembrance for nazi victims .
the event was meant to address a city monument that had become obscure due to increasing car traffic nearby .
" memory loops analyzes the most varied historical dimensions by focusing on certain crystallization points in the city of munich .
using archival material and contemporary witness statements , melian artistically shapes voice-collages of the highest quality , " noted the jury .
but the idea also had detractors , including munich 's mayor , christian ude .
he reacted to melian 's proposal in 2008 by wondering whether " its means can be used to achieve an appropriate memorial . "
young voices two years later , the project has been opened and is accessible online as of late september 2010 -lrb- see the link to memory loops below -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michaela melian wanted the memory loops project to appeal to young audiences melian drew from newspapers and holocaust archives and conducted interviews personally to accumulate the material for the project .
then she sought out actors - especially children and other young voices - to speak and record the accounts she found .
" i really wanted the files to sound like young people , " explained melian .
" many victims were young when they left the camps or returned from russia . "
the stories reflect their daily struggles and the nazi regime 's gradual expansion of control over their lives .
one victim 's account is tagged to the address sonnenstrasse 116 , just beyond the city center : " once , there was an air raid warning as i was out in town and wearing the star .
i wanted to go down into a shelter nearby , but they did n't let the jew boy in .
the old botanical garden is a stone 's throw away .
i hid under a shrub and cried - bombs were falling left and right . "
atmospheric music the short audio files are linked to a map indicating where each scene actually occurred .
michaela melian composed the music that accompanies many of their statements , taking inspiration from jewish musicians and composers who collided with nazi ideology during that period .
" karl amadeus hartmann was forbidden from working back then , coco schumann was prevented from performing , and mendelssohn-bartholdy could only be performed by jewish musicians for jewish audiences , " said melian .
" those are facets of the story that i wanted to include in the audio files in a subliminal way . "
a city-wide memorial at the memory loops homepage , visitors can click on 175 blue circles in the english version - and 300 in the german edition - to hear the stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project is also available as an audio guide for mobile phones the project is also being supported by broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk and will be presented as a series of radio programs .
some munich museums are lending their support as well by making mp3 players available with which people can tour the city and hear the stories as they go .
a similar version in english can be downloaded and installed on smart phones .
memory loops is , then , a kind of monument that is spread out across the city .
" i wanted to use the media that occupy nearly all of young people 's free time as well as their working lives : the internet and cell phones .
these days , many young people spend more time on the internet than at any social or public places , " melian said .
intimate glimpses into history munich was a center of activity for the nazi party .
that 's why the city is particularly revealing for those who want to understand the forms of persecution to which nazi victims were subjected and what their lives were like .
" in 1935 , we had to leave the apartment and moved to a cheap and dark ground-floor apartment on trogerstrasse -lsb- troger street -rsb- .
it was very close to where hitler lived .
coming home from church once , we saw him in an open mercedes .
my father said to us , ' a little bomb would be just the thing here , " ' recalls one voice in the memory loops project .
it continues , " we lived extremely modestly .
the other boys at school had it pretty good at home - suddenly , their families had jobs and work , and of course their children were all in the hitler youth .
i had to keep quiet about how things were at home with me . "

the project is a digital memorial to the victims of national socialism in the bavarian capital .
it draws on archival and audio footage relating to the holocaust and can be accessed online in both german and english .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michaela melian wanted the memory loops project to appeal to young audiences melian drew from newspapers and holocaust archives and conducted interviews personally to accumulate the material for the project .

" i really wanted the files to sound like young people , " explained melian .
" many victims were young when they left the camps or returned from russia . "
the stories reflect their daily struggles and the nazi regime 's gradual expansion of control over their lives .

from stimulus to growth buoyant demand from abroad and economic stimulus are casting german industry in a positive light by international comparison .
for all the media criticism , german economic policy is better than its reputation , even if a broad growth agenda is still in its infancy .
above and beyond the austerity package already presented , government spending must be scrutinised for its contribution to growth .
tax breaks and subsidies need serious pruning , accompanied by income tax relief in the medium term , with windfall revenues being used to reduce deficits more quickly .
the risks inherent in the social welfare system must be brought under control and latent growth potential in the healthcare system leveraged .
labour policy should continue down the successful path of greater flexibilisation .
a better level of education and sufficient supply of skilled staff would generate consistently more economic momentum .
an integrated energy and climate policy remains an absolutely vital growth driver . our country has innovative minds !
curtain up ...
germany is one of the most knowledge-intensive and innovative countries on earth .
in this study we focus on the innovative performance of its sixteen federal states with reference to eight indicators .
the most innovative states lie in the south , while the east trails in terms of absolute levels .
however , interdisciplinarity and regional industrial diversity cushion negative effects of structural change on the regions and offer alternative sources of sustained economic growth .
looking at the dynamic of innovation it is apparent that the states in the east of germany spearheaded by saxony are on the right course . germany : only modest decline in the current account surplus the german export momentum is currently benefiting from extremely dynamic world trade .
however , it is likely to ease significantly in h2 2010 and above all in 2011 .
in addition to the impact of this cyclical development the highly export-dependent german economy is also being hit by the adjustments in europe ’ s crisis-ridden countries , even though the strain on the german current account is likely to remain within bounds .
nevertheless , in the medium term germany ’ s large current account surplus needs to be reduced , as the origins of the crisis lay in undesirable structural developments on both sides , that is not only in current account deficits , but also in the reciprocal surpluses .
all in all , we expect that the german current account surplus will first widen from 5.0 % to 5 ½ % of gdp this year , before narrowing slowly , however .
in 2012 it could then stand at 4 ½ % . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 12.10.2010 militant islam gains ground in the balkans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's feared that some muslim charities could encourage wahhabism a recent online music video featuring macedonians praising osama bin laden has fueled fears that southeastern europe could be emerging as the latest breeding ground for homegrown islamist militants . it has also focused attention on muslim charities active in bosnia , kosovo , serbia , albania , macedonia and european union member bulgaria since the wars in former yugoslavia in the mid-1990s .
many of those charities are funded by oil-rich saudi arabia and propagate wahhabism - the kingdom 's austere and puritan interpretation of islam .
a majority of wahhabis favor peaceful proselytizing of islam while saudi king abdullah has been seeking to soften wahhabi practices as part of his reforms in the kingdom .
militant groups such as osama bin laden 's al-qaeda , the taliban and jihadists in somalia have however embraced significant elements of wahhabism as part of their ideology .
jasmin merdan , a young bosnian who wrote a book after disassociating himself from wahhabis groups in bosnia , warned that " they express their convictions with violence , introduce anarchy in mosques and preach intolerance . " women in the albanian city of skadar have reportedly started covering their heads or wearing the niqab , a full body covering that hides everything but the eyes , in newly found religiosity .
the video posted on youtube is one of several produced by home grown jihadists in the balkans and circulating in the region .
" oh osama , annihilate the american army .
oh osama , raise the muslims ’ honor , " a group of macedonian men chant in albanian on the video .
" in september 2001 you conquered a power .
we all pray for you . "
similar songs calling on southeastern european muslims to join the jihad have been produced in bosnian .
governments and security forces fear that that increased wahhabi activity will produce committed jihadis that could destabilize already fragile nations in southeastern europe and , in the case of bulgaria - where one sixth of the country 's 7.6 million people is muslim - produce a pool of jihadists whose eu passports would grant them easy access to western europe and allow them to blend into society . bulgaria seen as potential breeding ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most bulgarian muslims are of turkish ethnicity bulgaria is the only eu member whose muslim population are not recent immigrants .
most bulgarian muslims like those elsewhere in the balkans are descendants of ethnic turks who arrived during five centuries of ottoman rule .
three ethnic albanian brothers from macedonia were convicted to life in prison in 2008 on charges of plotting to attack the us army 's fort dix military base in new jersey .
a fourth member of the group from kosovo was sentenced to five years in jail .
across the balkans , minority wahhabi groups seek to convert mainstream islam to their more militant interpretation through the operation of cultural centers , mosques , schools and at times by battling for control of majority muslim organizations and community-owned property .
a majority of the region 's muslims are secular and analysts caution against overstating the wahhabi threat .
" it should not be ignored , but neither should it be exaggerated , " said hajrudin somun a former bosnian ambassador to turkey and history professor at sarajevo 's philip noel-baker international university .
the analysts say militant islam is gaining ground on the fringe of a more general return to religion in the balkans .
several thousand orthodox christian bulgarians demonstrated in sofia recently demanding that religious instruction be made compulsory in schools - a demand supported by mainstream muslim organizations .
muslim organizations are believed to have spent large amounts of money over the last decade to build some 150 new mosques and educational centers in predominantly orthodox bulgaria .
a minority are believed to promote wahhabism .
analysts say that radical islam has gained ground in southern and northeastern bulgaria where militant islamists , according to former bulgarian chief mufti nedim gendzhev , are seeking to create a " fundamentalist triangle " in areas of bosnia , macedonia and bulgaria 's western rhodope mountains .
fears of increasing radicalism bulgarian authorities last year arrested a mayor and a village teacher in the south of the country on charges of preaching radical islam .
in 2003 , authorities shut down several islamic centers because they were financed by saudi-funded muslim groups believed to have links to militant islamic organizations and " to prevent terrorists getting a foothold in bulgaria . "
some analysts estimate that 3,000 young muslims have graduated from militant schools still operating in bulgaria ; it was not immediately clear what they went on to do following their graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations are tense between muslims and serbs in bosnia the threat posed by the wahhabis is a major bone of contention in tense relations between muslims and serbs in bosnia , which so far has successfully neutralized wahhabi influence by controlling the appointment of imams in mosques and teachers at islamic educational institutions and employing law enforcement .
some bosnian wahhabis , estimated to number 3,000 , are former foreign fighters who married bosnian women and stayed in the country after the bosnian war that ended in 1995 .
bosnia recently stepped up its fight against militancy and organized crime to meet an eu requirement for visa-free travel for bosnians and closer ties with the bloc .
in early september , bosnian police uncovered a cache of weapons and detained a third suspect as part of their inquiry into a june bomb attack that killed one policeman and injured six others .
the attack on a police station in the town of bugojno was one of the most serious security incidents in bosnia .
police arrested the suspected mastermind and an aide shortly after the blast .
bosnia tries to crackdown on militants boris grubesic , a spokesman for the bosnian prosecutor 's office , told reporters in mid-september that prosecutors were investigating several people from bugojno and gornja maoca on suspicion of wahhabi ties , terrorism and human trafficking .
in february , bosnian and eu police raided gornja maoca and arrested seven men described as wahhabis because of their beards and shortened trousers .
police said they were detained for suspected illegal possession of arms and threatening the country 's " territorial integrity , constitutional order and provoking inter-ethnic and religious hatred . " gornja maoca was home to some 30 families who lived by strict shariah laws , organized schooling in arabic for their children outside the state system and opposed the primacy of bosnia 's mainstream islamic community .
nusret imamovic , the town 's self-proclaimed wahhabi leader , endorsed suicide attacks on the group 's bosnian language website , saying they should be launched only in " exceptional circumstances . "
the site features statements by al-qaeda and islamic groups fighting in the caucasus and celebrates suicide bombers as joyful muslims .
serbian officials say 12 alleged wahhabis convicted last year to prison terms of up to 13 years for planning terrorist attacks , including on the us embassy in belgrade , had close ties to their brethren in gornja maoca .
one of the convicted , adnan hot , said during the trial that imamovic was one of only three muslim leaders that he followed .
four other wahhabis were sentenced in a separate case to jail terms of up to eight years on charges of planning to bomb a football stadium in the southern serbian town of novi pazar .
in macedonia , suleyman rexhepim rexhepi , head of the official islamic religious community -lrb- ivz -rrb- , recently called on the government and the international community to crack down on increasingly influential wahabbi groups .
rexhepi is locked into a bitter battle with ramadan ramadani , the imam of the isa beg mosque in skopje , that has caused a rift in the country 's muslim community .
ramadani accuses rexhep of financial msmangement and is seeking his ouster .
he organized a petition signed by thousands of his followers supporting his bid for leadership of the community after rexhepi banned him from organizing prayers .
ramadani denies that wahhabis are active among macedonian muslims who account for roughly one quarter of the population as well as allegations that the pro-bin laden music video was played in mosques he controls .
a ramadani associate , radical kosovo imam sefket krasnici , shocked macedonians , when he recently denounced mother teresa , a native of skopje whom many consider a saint , during a sermon in the macedonian capital .
" she belongs in the middle of hell because she did not believe in allah , the prophet and the koran ...
even if she believed in god her belief was incomplete , with deficiencies .
god does not accept such worship , " krasnici said .

but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .

the french senate voted on monday to raise the age at which people are given full pensions from 65 to 67 . the french senate on friday agreed to raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62 , bringing the unpopular bill closer to becoming law .
president nicolas sarkozy also wants to raise the age at which workers can retire with a full pension – to 67 .
the senate approved that part of the bill on monday .
transport workers plan to protest in the usual way : by taking to the streets .
the transport network is likely to be severely disrupted on tuesday .
street protests are also expected in a fresh wave on unrest over sarkozy 's plans .
half the flights to and from paris orly airport , and one in three at charles de gaulle are likely to be cancelled because of walkouts by airport workers .
on the railways , one in three high-speed tgv trains will be operating .
the paris metro is also likely to be severely hit .
teachers , truckers and postal workers are planning to join the protests .
meanwhile , dock workers on strike in the oil port of fos-lavera forced a partial shutdown of a major refinery .
they have been protesting for over two weeks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy says he will not back down over the reforms however , sarkozy has so far remained firm on the unpopular plans , which are aimed at safeguarding france 's cherished aaa credit rating , which enables it to borrow at low rates .
his office said he has no intention of backing down .
" we 're not here to do what 's easy , we do n't always have the people 's approval , " labor minister eric woerth told the senate .
most unions are planning a one-day strike , but the protests are renewable by a daily vote .
a survey for the newspaper le parisien on monday showed that 69 percent of the french back tuesday 's strike , with 61 percent in favor of open-ended industrial action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 12.10.2010 european commission to push member states to do more to help roma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has deported thousands of roma to romania this summer starting tuesday , romania is hosting a two-day conference of european nations to discuss how to help integrate roma travelers .
europe 's social affairs commissioner said financial help is available to member states . the european commission will once again push member states to do more to improve the situation for roma travelers on tuesday at a conference in bucharest .
the meeting was organized after the french government began its deportations of roma families over the summer , drawing international criticism .
the bucharest conference aims to promote the better use of eu funds to improve the socio-economic situation of the 10 to 12 million roma living on the continent .
they face discrimination , poverty , segregation , and barriers to education and the labor market in many of the european countries in which they settle .
in slovakia , for example , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education .
in bulgaria , over 50 percent of roma are unemployed .
in romania only about a quarter of roma have a steady job .
european funds are under-used in recent years the european union has brought in a comprehensive financial program to promote the integration of the roma and sinti travelers .
but romania and bulgaria , the eu member states with the biggest roma communities , have made little use of the subsidies .
despite the high-profile debate about integration of roma sparked by france 's crackdown on its traveling community , the european union 's commissioner for social affairs and inclusion complained recently that few nations are drawing on the available financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laszlo andor wants countries to make better use of european funds " i would like to stress that this is the responsibility of the european union and the member states together , " andor said in the european parliament .
" the structural funds offer a very useful financial lever for supporting national efforts to improve the situation of the roma .
however , eu funds are often not fully used , or not used in the most effective way . "
currently romania is only using 1 percent of the 2.25 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- made available by the european social fund between 2007 and 2013 to improve the situation of vulnerable groups .
bulgaria is only using 5 percent of the fund .
integration is not just about money however , there is of course no compulsion to use the money .
the german conservative mep manfred weber hopes there is enough incentive for countries to apply for the money if they need it .
" the decisive factor in integration of course is always that it ca n't be proscribed from above , rather it 's got to happen in the towns , in the communities themselves , " weber told deutsche welle .
" it demands creativity . "
the european commission has set up a working group to assess why the roma struggle so much with integration .
the group will deliver its findings by the end of the year .
in the meantime andor wants member states to set ambitious targets for tackling poverty and improving the educational horizons of the roma .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in slovakia , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education " it 's only about poverty reduction , it 's not only about social inclusion , " the commissioner said .
" we have to ensure that the roma are explicitly mentioned in our new employment flagship initiative , because that 's also where a breakthrough has to be made . "
manfred weber believes governments have to tackle the root of the problem by targeting education .
“ we have to follow through the idea that children of this ethnic minority must attend school .
only then can we succeed in truly integrating these travelling families into european societies . ”
the problems for the roma in europe are not new .
there is money available in europe to tackle it .
but it has taken the row over the policy of deporting roma from france to bring this much-beleaguered community into the spotlight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.10.2010 germany 's khedira has gone from backup to bulwark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was germany 's heart and soul against turkey as a defensive stopper , sami khedira does n't post the sort of numbers that leap out at you from score sheets .
but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 12.10.2010 european commission to push member states to do more to help roma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has deported thousands of roma to romania this summer starting tuesday , romania is hosting a two-day conference of european nations to discuss how to help integrate roma travelers .
europe 's social affairs commissioner said financial help is available to member states . the european commission will once again push member states to do more to improve the situation for roma travelers on tuesday at a conference in bucharest .
the meeting was organized after the french government began its deportations of roma families over the summer , drawing international criticism .
the bucharest conference aims to promote the better use of eu funds to improve the socio-economic situation of the 10 to 12 million roma living on the continent .
they face discrimination , poverty , segregation , and barriers to education and the labor market in many of the european countries in which they settle .
in slovakia , for example , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education .
in bulgaria , over 50 percent of roma are unemployed .
in romania only about a quarter of roma have a steady job .
european funds are under-used in recent years the european union has brought in a comprehensive financial program to promote the integration of the roma and sinti travelers .
but romania and bulgaria , the eu member states with the biggest roma communities , have made little use of the subsidies .
despite the high-profile debate about integration of roma sparked by france 's crackdown on its traveling community , the european union 's commissioner for social affairs and inclusion complained recently that few nations are drawing on the available financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laszlo andor wants countries to make better use of european funds " i would like to stress that this is the responsibility of the european union and the member states together , " andor said in the european parliament .
" the structural funds offer a very useful financial lever for supporting national efforts to improve the situation of the roma .
however , eu funds are often not fully used , or not used in the most effective way . "
currently romania is only using 1 percent of the 2.25 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- made available by the european social fund between 2007 and 2013 to improve the situation of vulnerable groups .
bulgaria is only using 5 percent of the fund .
integration is not just about money however , there is of course no compulsion to use the money .
the german conservative mep manfred weber hopes there is enough incentive for countries to apply for the money if they need it .
" the decisive factor in integration of course is always that it ca n't be proscribed from above , rather it 's got to happen in the towns , in the communities themselves , " weber told deutsche welle .
" it demands creativity . "
the european commission has set up a working group to assess why the roma struggle so much with integration .
the group will deliver its findings by the end of the year .
in the meantime andor wants member states to set ambitious targets for tackling poverty and improving the educational horizons of the roma .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in slovakia , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education " it 's only about poverty reduction , it 's not only about social inclusion , " the commissioner said .
" we have to ensure that the roma are explicitly mentioned in our new employment flagship initiative , because that 's also where a breakthrough has to be made . "
manfred weber believes governments have to tackle the root of the problem by targeting education .
“ we have to follow through the idea that children of this ethnic minority must attend school .
only then can we succeed in truly integrating these travelling families into european societies . ”
the problems for the roma in europe are not new .
there is money available in europe to tackle it .
but it has taken the row over the policy of deporting roma from france to bring this much-beleaguered community into the spotlight .

but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

many of those charities are funded by oil-rich saudi arabia and propagate wahhabism - the kingdom 's austere and puritan interpretation of islam .
a majority of wahhabis favor peaceful proselytizing of islam while saudi king abdullah has been seeking to soften wahhabi practices as part of his reforms in the kingdom .
militant groups such as osama bin laden 's al-qaeda , the taliban and jihadists in somalia have however embraced significant elements of wahhabism as part of their ideology .
jasmin merdan , a young bosnian who wrote a book after disassociating himself from wahhabis groups in bosnia , warned that " they express their convictions with violence , introduce anarchy in mosques and preach intolerance . " women in the albanian city of skadar have reportedly started covering their heads or wearing the niqab , a full body covering that hides everything but the eyes , in newly found religiosity .

" oh osama , annihilate the american army .
oh osama , raise the muslims ’ honor , " a group of macedonian men chant in albanian on the video .
" in september 2001 you conquered a power .
we all pray for you . "
similar songs calling on southeastern european muslims to join the jihad have been produced in bosnian .
governments and security forces fear that that increased wahhabi activity will produce committed jihadis that could destabilize already fragile nations in southeastern europe and , in the case of bulgaria - where one sixth of the country 's 7.6 million people is muslim - produce a pool of jihadists whose eu passports would grant them easy access to western europe and allow them to blend into society . bulgaria seen as potential breeding ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most bulgarian muslims are of turkish ethnicity bulgaria is the only eu member whose muslim population are not recent immigrants .
most bulgarian muslims like those elsewhere in the balkans are descendants of ethnic turks who arrived during five centuries of ottoman rule .
three ethnic albanian brothers from macedonia were convicted to life in prison in 2008 on charges of plotting to attack the us army 's fort dix military base in new jersey .
a fourth member of the group from kosovo was sentenced to five years in jail .
across the balkans , minority wahhabi groups seek to convert mainstream islam to their more militant interpretation through the operation of cultural centers , mosques , schools and at times by battling for control of majority muslim organizations and community-owned property .
a majority of the region 's muslims are secular and analysts caution against overstating the wahhabi threat .
" it should not be ignored , but neither should it be exaggerated , " said hajrudin somun a former bosnian ambassador to turkey and history professor at sarajevo 's philip noel-baker international university .
the analysts say militant islam is gaining ground on the fringe of a more general return to religion in the balkans .
several thousand orthodox christian bulgarians demonstrated in sofia recently demanding that religious instruction be made compulsory in schools - a demand supported by mainstream muslim organizations .
muslim organizations are believed to have spent large amounts of money over the last decade to build some 150 new mosques and educational centers in predominantly orthodox bulgaria .
a minority are believed to promote wahhabism .
analysts say that radical islam has gained ground in southern and northeastern bulgaria where militant islamists , according to former bulgarian chief mufti nedim gendzhev , are seeking to create a " fundamentalist triangle " in areas of bosnia , macedonia and bulgaria 's western rhodope mountains .
fears of increasing radicalism bulgarian authorities last year arrested a mayor and a village teacher in the south of the country on charges of preaching radical islam .
in 2003 , authorities shut down several islamic centers because they were financed by saudi-funded muslim groups believed to have links to militant islamic organizations and " to prevent terrorists getting a foothold in bulgaria . "
some analysts estimate that 3,000 young muslims have graduated from militant schools still operating in bulgaria ; it was not immediately clear what they went on to do following their graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations are tense between muslims and serbs in bosnia the threat posed by the wahhabis is a major bone of contention in tense relations between muslims and serbs in bosnia , which so far has successfully neutralized wahhabi influence by controlling the appointment of imams in mosques and teachers at islamic educational institutions and employing law enforcement .
some bosnian wahhabis , estimated to number 3,000 , are former foreign fighters who married bosnian women and stayed in the country after the bosnian war that ended in 1995 .
bosnia recently stepped up its fight against militancy and organized crime to meet an eu requirement for visa-free travel for bosnians and closer ties with the bloc .
in early september , bosnian police uncovered a cache of weapons and detained a third suspect as part of their inquiry into a june bomb attack that killed one policeman and injured six others .
the attack on a police station in the town of bugojno was one of the most serious security incidents in bosnia .
police arrested the suspected mastermind and an aide shortly after the blast .
bosnia tries to crackdown on militants boris grubesic , a spokesman for the bosnian prosecutor 's office , told reporters in mid-september that prosecutors were investigating several people from bugojno and gornja maoca on suspicion of wahhabi ties , terrorism and human trafficking .
in february , bosnian and eu police raided gornja maoca and arrested seven men described as wahhabis because of their beards and shortened trousers .
police said they were detained for suspected illegal possession of arms and threatening the country 's " territorial integrity , constitutional order and provoking inter-ethnic and religious hatred . " gornja maoca was home to some 30 families who lived by strict shariah laws , organized schooling in arabic for their children outside the state system and opposed the primacy of bosnia 's mainstream islamic community .
nusret imamovic , the town 's self-proclaimed wahhabi leader , endorsed suicide attacks on the group 's bosnian language website , saying they should be launched only in " exceptional circumstances . "
the site features statements by al-qaeda and islamic groups fighting in the caucasus and celebrates suicide bombers as joyful muslims .
serbian officials say 12 alleged wahhabis convicted last year to prison terms of up to 13 years for planning terrorist attacks , including on the us embassy in belgrade , had close ties to their brethren in gornja maoca .
one of the convicted , adnan hot , said during the trial that imamovic was one of only three muslim leaders that he followed .
four other wahhabis were sentenced in a separate case to jail terms of up to eight years on charges of planning to bomb a football stadium in the southern serbian town of novi pazar .
in macedonia , suleyman rexhepim rexhepi , head of the official islamic religious community -lrb- ivz -rrb- , recently called on the government and the international community to crack down on increasingly influential wahabbi groups .
rexhepi is locked into a bitter battle with ramadan ramadani , the imam of the isa beg mosque in skopje , that has caused a rift in the country 's muslim community .
ramadani accuses rexhep of financial msmangement and is seeking his ouster .
he organized a petition signed by thousands of his followers supporting his bid for leadership of the community after rexhepi banned him from organizing prayers .
ramadani denies that wahhabis are active among macedonian muslims who account for roughly one quarter of the population as well as allegations that the pro-bin laden music video was played in mosques he controls .
a ramadani associate , radical kosovo imam sefket krasnici , shocked macedonians , when he recently denounced mother teresa , a native of skopje whom many consider a saint , during a sermon in the macedonian capital .
" she belongs in the middle of hell because she did not believe in allah , the prophet and the koran ...
even if she believed in god her belief was incomplete , with deficiencies .
god does not accept such worship , " krasnici said .

the two-day conference is being held in the romanian capital , bucharest . european union officials , romanian politicians and roma representatives are discussing integration issues regarding europe 's roma population at a two-day eu conference held in romania 's capital , bucharest .
the conference is aimed at finding solutions on how to achieve more with the money spent by the european union on integrating roma , said the european commissioner for employment and social affairs , laszlo andor , at the opening of the conference .
" a lot has been done in terms of strategic planning , coordination and implementation , but at the end of the day , not much has really changed . " he said .
andor wants eu member states to become more engaged in integrating their roma population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " not much has really changed " - andor said at the conference " the eu can not solve the multi-layered problems of the roma by itself , " he said .
" the european union is ready to step up its efforts for roma integration , but that is also what we expect from all member states . "
funding is available , yet few members take the money even though the european union has funds available , member states refrain from using the money .
from 2007 until 2013 , the european social fund offered 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.1 billion -rrb- to help finance education and housing projects for roma .
especially countries with a high number of roma population like hungary , bulgaria and romania were expected make use of the funds .
the eu has installed a task force in order to find out why member states do not act even though the funds are available .
the task force is expected to present its results by the end of this year .
hungarian prime minister viktor orban said that the integration of roma would be one of the main focuses in hungary 's term in the eu presidency beginning in january .
according to andor , france 's drastic measures of expelling thousands of roma were " very unfortunate " , but " ironically energized the discussions on roma inclusion . "
problem of roma integration will not affect schengen talks german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting romanian prime minister emil boc that the problem of roma integration would not affect negotiations on romania becoming part of the schengen zone .
being a country within the schengen treaty would give romanian citizen visa-free travel within the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a long way from the end of the road , " - according to chancellor merkel merkel said that germany would judge romania 's development on their way to the schengen treaty fairly - but did not promise a quick entrance to the schengen zone .
" the reforms of the judiciary and of interior affairs are being tackled very courageously , but you are still a long way from the end of the road , " merkel said . " we back romania 's efforts to join the schengen zone ... but we must make sure that visa delivery procedures are not marred by corruption , " she said .
it is crucial that romania only issue visas without signs of corruption or unregularities and that eu 's external borders are safe .
" there are no reasonable alternatives to transparent and clear legal terms . " romania is hoping to enter the schengen zone in the middle of 2011 .
the country has been a member of the eu since 2007 .
most of europe 's roma are said to live in romania , but there are no reliable numbers - with figures ranging from a population of 530,000 up to 2.5 million .

he added that the men " were fed misinformation and brainwashed " through anti-monarchy videos and cds at the cambodian military base .
they were also trained to use weapons and explosives for the purpose of assassinating top thai leaders including the prime minister . thais ' always put the blame on cambodia ' koy kuong , a spokesman at cambodia ’ s ministry of foreign affairs retorted that " the thais always put the blame on cambodia when they can not solve their internal problems , " according to reuters news agency . thailand ’ s nervousness is possibly related to the mysterious bomb blast in the thai capital last week , indicating a possible radicalization of some elements of the anti-government movement .
on the other hand , tensions already exist between the two neighbours over border disputes and over cambodia ’ s ties to former thai premier thaksin shinawatra , who is believed to be providing guidance as well as finances for the red shirts . ac / reuters / ap editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
he is hoping his visit will help promote “ sensible arrangements . ”
but observers are skeptical . economics minister rainer bruederle has framed his two-day trip to china , which began in beijing on tuesday , as a pacifying mission , following recent acrimony between china and many g-20 countries over trade .
" the danger of a trade war has appeared on the horizon , " bruederle told reporters traveling with him on his two-day trip to china , which is to include stops in beijing and shanghai .
the minister warned that accusations of currency manipulation should not be allowed to escalate , and protectionism must be avoided .
some of china 's trading partners in the us and europe have recently accused beijing of allowing the yuan to depreciate at a faster pace .
critics say the unit could be undervalued by as much as 40 percent .
ambassador and missionary speaking in beijing , bruederle refuted these claims , pointing out that the yuan had increased in value by 15 to 17 percent in the past two years , and he added that he did not expect the chinese government to adopt flexible trading patterns in the future .
" we must not allow the situation to get out of hand , or turn our backs on free trade , " bruederle said , adding that he saw himself as an " ambassador , perhaps even a missionary , for the fight against protectionism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has faced pressure from the eu over currency depreciation bruederle expressed satisfaction with the state of german-chinese trade , which has grown significantly this year .
german exports to china have grown by 52 percent to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of this year , while chinese exports have risen by 34 percent , compared to 2009 figures .
germany is considered one of china 's best friends in the west .
" the germans have been pushing for an open trade policy towards china , " jonathan holslag of the brussels institute of contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" germany 's economic revival after the financial crisis has been - to a large degree - made in china . "
" most of the expansion in germany 's exports – particularly cars and machinery – has been bound for china , " says holslag .
for this reason , holslag believes , the german government has often cautioned against protectionism towards china .
" angela merkel has also openly expressed her support for granting china market economy status , " holslag points out .
" this would make it more difficult for the european commission to apply anti-dumping procedures . "
good on the small-scale , not so much on the large-scale but despite germany 's huge economic interest in china – not only through exports , but also through direct investment from individual companies – bruederle 's leverage during this trip is likely to be limited .
the minister said that one of his main aims for the trip was to ensure that medium-sized german businesses gained better opportunities in china .
after his meetings with chinese commerce minister chen deming and zhang ping , the head of the country 's top economic planning agency , bruederle said he had been assured that german companies could take part in open competition in china provided they used a minimum of 50 percent local products .
but holslag believes this is a secondary priority for bruederle compared to maintaining export agreements .
" it 's important to distinguish degrees of urgency , " he says .
" the most important objective for the german government is to step up exports , and the second level is access to the chinese market .
germany is likely to be very cautious in negotiations , in order to protect exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery has been largely based on exports to china but despite this , there is concern that german companies are being disadvantaged by the chinese government .
rolf langhammer , vice-president of the kiel institute for the world economy , believes that this is where bruederle can at least make sure german businesses can get their voices heard .
" germany enjoys a very good position in china compared to other european countries , but of course there are barriers to mid-sized german companies , " he told deutsche welle .
" a lot of representatives of these firms are accompanying bruederle . "
langhammer does not think that bruederle can apply much pressure on the question of global exchange rates – the issue he addressed on arrival .
" the chinese government has always made clear that it wo n't let itself be influenced on this subject , and bruederle 's visit wo n't change anything in the discussion about the exchange rate . "
langhammer is also unconvinced by bruederle 's attempt to position himself as a mediator between the china and the west .
" that 's a role he can not play , " he says .
" he is much too small for that .
he does n't speak for the eurozone , he speaks for an export country called germany .
of course he can represent the interests of mid-sized companies , and he can voice their concerns if they feel themselves disadvantaged alongside chinese competition , but he ca n't solve the big questions – and he ca n't be a mediator in them . "

but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 12.10.2010 eu searches for answers in roma integration debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some roma have been deported back to romania from france integrating roma in european countries has proven to be difficult , but experts at an eu conference are trying to find solutions .
the two-day conference is being held in the romanian capital , bucharest . european union officials , romanian politicians and roma representatives are discussing integration issues regarding europe 's roma population at a two-day eu conference held in romania 's capital , bucharest .
the conference is aimed at finding solutions on how to achieve more with the money spent by the european union on integrating roma , said the european commissioner for employment and social affairs , laszlo andor , at the opening of the conference .
" a lot has been done in terms of strategic planning , coordination and implementation , but at the end of the day , not much has really changed . " he said .
andor wants eu member states to become more engaged in integrating their roma population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " not much has really changed " - andor said at the conference " the eu can not solve the multi-layered problems of the roma by itself , " he said .
" the european union is ready to step up its efforts for roma integration , but that is also what we expect from all member states . "
funding is available , yet few members take the money even though the european union has funds available , member states refrain from using the money .
from 2007 until 2013 , the european social fund offered 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.1 billion -rrb- to help finance education and housing projects for roma .
especially countries with a high number of roma population like hungary , bulgaria and romania were expected make use of the funds .
the eu has installed a task force in order to find out why member states do not act even though the funds are available .
the task force is expected to present its results by the end of this year .
hungarian prime minister viktor orban said that the integration of roma would be one of the main focuses in hungary 's term in the eu presidency beginning in january .
according to andor , france 's drastic measures of expelling thousands of roma were " very unfortunate " , but " ironically energized the discussions on roma inclusion . "
problem of roma integration will not affect schengen talks german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting romanian prime minister emil boc that the problem of roma integration would not affect negotiations on romania becoming part of the schengen zone .
being a country within the schengen treaty would give romanian citizen visa-free travel within the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a long way from the end of the road , " - according to chancellor merkel merkel said that germany would judge romania 's development on their way to the schengen treaty fairly - but did not promise a quick entrance to the schengen zone .
" the reforms of the judiciary and of interior affairs are being tackled very courageously , but you are still a long way from the end of the road , " merkel said . " we back romania 's efforts to join the schengen zone ... but we must make sure that visa delivery procedures are not marred by corruption , " she said .
it is crucial that romania only issue visas without signs of corruption or unregularities and that eu 's external borders are safe .
" there are no reasonable alternatives to transparent and clear legal terms . " romania is hoping to enter the schengen zone in the middle of 2011 .
the country has been a member of the eu since 2007 .
most of europe 's roma are said to live in romania , but there are no reliable numbers - with figures ranging from a population of 530,000 up to 2.5 million .

" learn german !
adjust to the customs of your host country , " he told daily newspaper bild in an interview published on tuesday .
" you do n't have to give up the gift of your identity and culture , but rather think of yourselves as ambassadors for turkey .
only then can you build bridges for a better friendship and partnership between our countries . "
three days before his comments were published , german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan met in berlin on the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between the two countries , pledging to cooperate more on integration of turks living in germany .
multi-faceted integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to work together on integration ines michalowski , a senior researcher at berlin 's social science research center , said the call for turkish-germans to maintain their culture while still adjusting to german customs may seem paradoxical , but that the two are not mutually exclusive .
" the turkish nation-state is a very nationalistic nation , where there are actually claims of turks belonging to the turkish nation-state even though they have been living abroad for several generations , " she told deutsche welle .
" but that does n't mean that integration on the labor market , or in the educational system , or contacts with germans - that these aspects of integration go badly . "
still , research shows that most turkish germans are poorly integrated in these areas - a fact which haci halil uslucan , director of the center for turkish studies and integration research , said can not be entirely attributed to a perceived lack of motivation of immigrants to integrate themselves .
" i think we also have to focus on the conditions of being integrated - and that means the attitudes of the majority , the look of the majority on the minority , " he told deutsche welle .
" the political discussion should not go in this direction of creating ranks - these are the good immigrants and these are the bad ones .
that only increases social tension . "
education is key bagis also said in his interview that turkish-german parents should send their children " to the best schools , so that they have a future , " echoing comments by prime minister erdogan that turkish-germans should prioritize education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research shows other minorities have integrated better than turks michalowski said studies of vietnamese immigrant parents in the eastern state of brandenburg have shown their children to have higher high-school graduation and college entrance rates than non-immigrant german children , partly because the parents place a high priority on education .
" some of the criticism has been that maybe turkish parents are not putting enough emphasis on getting a good education within germany , " she said .
" so if there is a government official from turkey who actually encourages people to pay more attention to the education of their children , i think that can never do any harm . "
but uslucan said other research shows that turkish-german parents have high educational aspirations for their children , and that teachers often send young turkish students to lower-level high schools that do not feed into universities , even when their educational performance is as good as their non-turkish peers .
" the doctrine must be that turkish parents should have more information about the german educational system , " he said .
" i think there is the problem that turkish parents do n't have enough information on what the best school is . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has made entry into the eu a high priority ambassadors for turkish eu accession in addition to his post as eu affairs minister , bagis is also chiefly responsible for negotiating turkey 's accession into the bloc .
while merkel has called turkey 's accession process " open-ended with no guarantees , " the turkish government has made it a high priority .
michalowski said bagis 's call on immigrants to integrate could be seen as a way of enhancing turkey 's chances of gaining eu membership .
" if you have a well-integrated minority , people in germany may be more favorable to the idea of turkey becoming a member of the european union than if the turkish community is always in the media as being badly integrated , " she said .

" learn german !
adjust to the customs of your host country , " he told daily newspaper bild in an interview published on tuesday .
" you do n't have to give up the gift of your identity and culture , but rather think of yourselves as ambassadors for turkey .
only then can you build bridges for a better friendship and partnership between our countries . "
three days before his comments were published , german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan met in berlin on the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between the two countries , pledging to cooperate more on integration of turks living in germany .
multi-faceted integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to work together on integration ines michalowski , a senior researcher at berlin 's social science research center , said the call for turkish-germans to maintain their culture while still adjusting to german customs may seem paradoxical , but that the two are not mutually exclusive .
" the turkish nation-state is a very nationalistic nation , where there are actually claims of turks belonging to the turkish nation-state even though they have been living abroad for several generations , " she told deutsche welle .
" but that does n't mean that integration on the labor market , or in the educational system , or contacts with germans - that these aspects of integration go badly . "
still , research shows that most turkish germans are poorly integrated in these areas - a fact which haci halil uslucan , director of the center for turkish studies and integration research , said can not be entirely attributed to a perceived lack of motivation of immigrants to integrate themselves .
" i think we also have to focus on the conditions of being integrated - and that means the attitudes of the majority , the look of the majority on the minority , " he told deutsche welle .
" the political discussion should not go in this direction of creating ranks - these are the good immigrants and these are the bad ones .
that only increases social tension . "
education is key bagis also said in his interview that turkish-german parents should send their children " to the best schools , so that they have a future , " echoing comments by prime minister erdogan that turkish-germans should prioritize education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research shows other minorities have integrated better than turks michalowski said studies of vietnamese immigrant parents in the eastern state of brandenburg have shown their children to have higher high-school graduation and college entrance rates than non-immigrant german children , partly because the parents place a high priority on education .
" some of the criticism has been that maybe turkish parents are not putting enough emphasis on getting a good education within germany , " she said .
" so if there is a government official from turkey who actually encourages people to pay more attention to the education of their children , i think that can never do any harm . "
but uslucan said other research shows that turkish-german parents have high educational aspirations for their children , and that teachers often send young turkish students to lower-level high schools that do not feed into universities , even when their educational performance is as good as their non-turkish peers .
" the doctrine must be that turkish parents should have more information about the german educational system , " he said .
" i think there is the problem that turkish parents do n't have enough information on what the best school is . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has made entry into the eu a high priority ambassadors for turkish eu accession in addition to his post as eu affairs minister , bagis is also chiefly responsible for negotiating turkey 's accession into the bloc .
while merkel has called turkey 's accession process " open-ended with no guarantees , " the turkish government has made it a high priority .
michalowski said bagis 's call on immigrants to integrate could be seen as a way of enhancing turkey 's chances of gaining eu membership .
" if you have a well-integrated minority , people in germany may be more favorable to the idea of turkey becoming a member of the european union than if the turkish community is always in the media as being badly integrated , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 12.10.2010 german economics minister warns of ' trade war ' with china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle arrived in china on tuesday economics minister rainer bruederle began his two-day trip to china with warnings of a " trade war . "
he is hoping his visit will help promote “ sensible arrangements . ”
but observers are skeptical . economics minister rainer bruederle has framed his two-day trip to china , which began in beijing on tuesday , as a pacifying mission , following recent acrimony between china and many g-20 countries over trade .
" the danger of a trade war has appeared on the horizon , " bruederle told reporters traveling with him on his two-day trip to china , which is to include stops in beijing and shanghai .
the minister warned that accusations of currency manipulation should not be allowed to escalate , and protectionism must be avoided .
some of china 's trading partners in the us and europe have recently accused beijing of allowing the yuan to depreciate at a faster pace .
critics say the unit could be undervalued by as much as 40 percent .
ambassador and missionary speaking in beijing , bruederle refuted these claims , pointing out that the yuan had increased in value by 15 to 17 percent in the past two years , and he added that he did not expect the chinese government to adopt flexible trading patterns in the future .
" we must not allow the situation to get out of hand , or turn our backs on free trade , " bruederle said , adding that he saw himself as an " ambassador , perhaps even a missionary , for the fight against protectionism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has faced pressure from the eu over currency depreciation bruederle expressed satisfaction with the state of german-chinese trade , which has grown significantly this year .
german exports to china have grown by 52 percent to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of this year , while chinese exports have risen by 34 percent , compared to 2009 figures .
germany is considered one of china 's best friends in the west .
" the germans have been pushing for an open trade policy towards china , " jonathan holslag of the brussels institute of contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" germany 's economic revival after the financial crisis has been - to a large degree - made in china . "
" most of the expansion in germany 's exports – particularly cars and machinery – has been bound for china , " says holslag .
for this reason , holslag believes , the german government has often cautioned against protectionism towards china .
" angela merkel has also openly expressed her support for granting china market economy status , " holslag points out .
" this would make it more difficult for the european commission to apply anti-dumping procedures . "
good on the small-scale , not so much on the large-scale but despite germany 's huge economic interest in china – not only through exports , but also through direct investment from individual companies – bruederle 's leverage during this trip is likely to be limited .
the minister said that one of his main aims for the trip was to ensure that medium-sized german businesses gained better opportunities in china .
after his meetings with chinese commerce minister chen deming and zhang ping , the head of the country 's top economic planning agency , bruederle said he had been assured that german companies could take part in open competition in china provided they used a minimum of 50 percent local products .
but holslag believes this is a secondary priority for bruederle compared to maintaining export agreements .
" it 's important to distinguish degrees of urgency , " he says .
" the most important objective for the german government is to step up exports , and the second level is access to the chinese market .
germany is likely to be very cautious in negotiations , in order to protect exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery has been largely based on exports to china but despite this , there is concern that german companies are being disadvantaged by the chinese government .
rolf langhammer , vice-president of the kiel institute for the world economy , believes that this is where bruederle can at least make sure german businesses can get their voices heard .
" germany enjoys a very good position in china compared to other european countries , but of course there are barriers to mid-sized german companies , " he told deutsche welle .
" a lot of representatives of these firms are accompanying bruederle . "
langhammer does not think that bruederle can apply much pressure on the question of global exchange rates – the issue he addressed on arrival .
" the chinese government has always made clear that it wo n't let itself be influenced on this subject , and bruederle 's visit wo n't change anything in the discussion about the exchange rate . "
langhammer is also unconvinced by bruederle 's attempt to position himself as a mediator between the china and the west .
" that 's a role he can not play , " he says .
" he is much too small for that .
he does n't speak for the eurozone , he speaks for an export country called germany .
of course he can represent the interests of mid-sized companies , and he can voice their concerns if they feel themselves disadvantaged alongside chinese competition , but he ca n't solve the big questions – and he ca n't be a mediator in them . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.10.2010 germany 's khedira has gone from backup to bulwark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was germany 's heart and soul against turkey as a defensive stopper , sami khedira does n't post the sort of numbers that leap out at you from score sheets .
but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

but not all germans are happy that their homes , cars and even themselves could be online for all to see . some 1 million germans make use of the street view service daily for a virtual ground 's eye look of the world , according to google .
but the company has been heavily criticized in germany as it gets ready to put maps of german cities online , which the company plans to do by the end of the year .
much of that criticism has come from the southern german state of bavaria , and the region around the city of ingolstadt in particular .
" the problem with google street view is that google - without asking - has gone and photographed german houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used , " georg schaeff , the publisher of the ingolstadt-based daily donaukurier , told deutsche welle .
the newspaper has publicized local opposition to the service for the last two years .
that 's a problem in germany since the country 's highest court has affirmed citizens ' rights to control who has their personal information and how it 's used .
google gives ground " we take privacy very seriously , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service . "
the california tech giant has made concessions to german privacy advocates by allowing material to be made unrecognizable before being published , which it has n't done in the other 23 countries street view is online .
furthermore , after facing widespread criticism , it doubled the opt-out period to eight weeks , which ends on friday .
some 200,000 people have taken google up on the offer to have their homes or apartment building blurred , according to a report in the german news magazine der spiegel .
google , which automatically blurs the faces and vehicle license plates its computer can recognize and asks users to point out the ones it misses , has not commented on the number of opt-out it has received .
bildunterschrift : some 200,000 people have removed themselves from street view , a german magazine reported but schaeff said people have no way of making sure what they see as a violation of their privacy really gets deleted .
he added that citizens have little recourse if google does n't agree with their claim of a privacy infringement by the panoramic photos of whatever is visible from the street taken by the eight cameras mounted on the company 's car .
" individual citizens ca n't assert themselves against these kinds of companies , " he said .
" and the corporations do n't bother to consider if what they are doing is illegal or not .
google works on the premise of ' why ask for permission when you can beg for forgiveness after the fact ? " '
privacy rift but privacy advocates still have a lot of convincing to do .
some 41 percent of germans see more positive than negative aspects to street view and 16 percent say they have or will remove their homes from the service , according to an august study by the emnid research institute .
many ingolstadt locals agreed with the poll 's sentiment .
" google can go ahead and do it , because everyone leaves their tracks all over the internet and everywhere else , " said ingo zingel , an ingolstadt resident .
" whether someone takes a picture of the door to my house really does n't matter . "
schaeff said he 's not surprised that some people do n't seem concerned about what 's happening to their personal information .
" i think there is a rift in society where half the people do n't see a problem and do n't know what 's coming down the road , " he said .
" the other half is much more sensitive and is more careful because the situation is far from clear . "
what 's unclear , he added , is how images from street view - or any other type of geodata , such as that collected by mobile phone providers - can be used to create profiles of individuals that are later sold to third parties .
without knowing how personal data will be used , he said people should give out as little as possible .
" each piece of personal information is like a stone that creates a mosaic , " schaeff said .
" every little stone plays a meaningful role , but , unfortunately , you ca n't tell what the role is until the whole picture has been made . "
' sensible areas ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 41 percent germans said street view has more positive than negative aspects but there are some pictures thomas herker , the mayor of pfaffenhofen , just south of ingolstadt , said he knows he does n't want made .
while he insisted that city hall and pubic offices be visible in street view , he added that some public buildings should be unrecognizable on the internet .
" we requested that google remove public kindergartens and schools , " he said referring to a letter the city sent in december 2009 to google 's german headquarters in hamburg .
" two weeks ago we were told they would not do it because only private individuals - not municipalities - have a right to remove property . "
herker led a group of bavarian mayors which sent another request to google asking for the company to respect their wishes and remove kindergartens and other " sensible areas " from street view .
while herker is left hoping google accounts for his city 's wishes , the point may become moot if the service goes online as planned by the end of the year .
the last time herker wrote to google it took 10 months to get a form letter response .
if it takes that long again the pictures will have long been online for all to see .
" there are three companies in germany that , in my opinion , are problematic : deutsche telekom , deutsche bahn , and now i 've added google to the list , " he said .
" i can only hope that google will change its mind and make it possible to remove public property from the service . "

but not all germans are happy that their homes , cars and even themselves could be online for all to see . some 1 million germans make use of the street view service daily for a virtual ground 's eye look of the world , according to google .
but the company has been heavily criticized in germany as it gets ready to put maps of german cities online , which the company plans to do by the end of the year .
much of that criticism has come from the southern german state of bavaria , and the region around the city of ingolstadt in particular .
" the problem with google street view is that google - without asking - has gone and photographed german houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used , " georg schaeff , the publisher of the ingolstadt-based daily donaukurier , told deutsche welle .
the newspaper has publicized local opposition to the service for the last two years .
that 's a problem in germany since the country 's highest court has affirmed citizens ' rights to control who has their personal information and how it 's used .
google gives ground " we take privacy very seriously , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service . "
the california tech giant has made concessions to german privacy advocates by allowing material to be made unrecognizable before being published , which it has n't done in the other 23 countries street view is online .

the kazakhs held die mannschaft for the first 45 minutes of the encounter , but were unable to stem the germans ’ flow of attacking football in the second half .
the first goal came from miroslav klose , who , finding the net for the third time in two games , slotted home three minutes after the break .
substitute mario gomez added a second goal in the 78th minute and lukas podolski put the final touch on the score line five minutes from fulltime .
the victory puts germany at the top of their group on 12 points , five clear of their nearest rival austria , who played out a thrilling 4-4 draw with belgium in tuesday 's late game .
the loss leaves kazakhstan bottom of the group with zero points .
germany coach joachim loew said that he was pleased with the result : " we achieved what we wanted to do , but obviously some errors occurred . "
" we have 12 points .
that is what we wanted , so i have to be satisfied .
what the team managed to achieve this year has been great , i ca n't expect them to be brilliant in every game , " he said .
" we have a lead at the top and that is comfortable , but we still need to win a few games before we can plan for the finals . "
in the third group a game played tuesday , azerbaijan pulled off a shock 1-0 win at home over a much-fancied turkey , who earlier in the week had gone down to germany in berlin .
the euro 2012 championships are to be held in poland and ukraine .

the kazakhs held die mannschaft for the first 45 minutes of the encounter , but were unable to stem the germans ’ flow of attacking football in the second half .
the first goal came from miroslav klose , who , finding the net for the third time in two games , slotted home three minutes after the break .
substitute mario gomez added a second goal in the 78th minute and lukas podolski put the final touch on the score line five minutes from fulltime .
the victory puts germany at the top of their group on 12 points , five clear of their nearest rival austria , who played out a thrilling 4-4 draw with belgium in tuesday 's late game .
the loss leaves kazakhstan bottom of the group with zero points .
germany coach joachim loew said that he was pleased with the result : " we achieved what we wanted to do , but obviously some errors occurred . "
" we have 12 points .
that is what we wanted , so i have to be satisfied .
what the team managed to achieve this year has been great , i ca n't expect them to be brilliant in every game , " he said .
" we have a lead at the top and that is comfortable , but we still need to win a few games before we can plan for the finals . "
in the third group a game played tuesday , azerbaijan pulled off a shock 1-0 win at home over a much-fancied turkey , who earlier in the week had gone down to germany in berlin .
the euro 2012 championships are to be held in poland and ukraine .

tadic , meanwhile , said serbia wanted " to be predictable partners , " adding that " only in that way will we rebuild trust . "

" it was not easy , and yet we watched as the official law enforcement forces demonstrated unequivocally your support for the rights of all . "

however , one city in the southern state of bavaria , oberstaufen , has publicly supported google street view - and may be the only city in the country that has supported the company to such a great degree .
in an interview with deutsche welle , bianca keybach , the head of oberstaufen 's tourist office , explained why the city even went so far as to bake for google .
deutsche welle : oberstaufen made a video and even baked a cake for google .
is that right ? bianca keybach : yes , we made a cake for google to welcome them and we put it into our facebook fan page and afterward we sent an invitation to google to say that we would be glad to welcome them here , and then google contacted us and we will see what happens .
when google contacted you , what happened ?
they were thankful for being so positive because this was a very big discussion in germany , -lsb- due to privacy -rsb- and taking pictures and everybody says we do n't want that .
we were one of the towns that said we would like -lsb- street view -rsb- .
tell me why you want google taking street view photographs in your town ?
what do you hope to accomplish other than to show how great the town is ?
i think that it would be an additional service for our guests .
when they are choosing a hotel or reading our brochures or they look at our homepage and they ca n't really say if everything is true , if there is a big street next to the hotel .
with google street view they can look into the town and discover the street , discover the region and after the holidays they can show their family and friends where they have been and what they can recommend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bianca keybach is the head of oberstaufen 's tourism office google has sent out their street view vehicles to big cities around germany , and they 're going to be releasing the photos for the 20 biggest cities around germany later this year .
have they actually sent a car to oberstaufen ?
they 've been here last year or at the beginning of this year .
they were in oberstaufen .
nobody saw them , though .

some have argued against street view because they say criminals could use it to plan robberies .
do you think that 's a valid argument ?
that 's a very interesting argument , because it 's one of the most important arguments for the critics but i think it 's crazy because the pictures were taken five or 10 months ago and they will be online for five or 10 years .
but if i want to get into a house and commit a crime , i wo n't use a picture that is many years old .
i could just use a postcard , for example , as a basis for burglary .
i think that 's not very realistic , but it 's very nice for a symbolic discussion .
are you surprised that there have n't been more cities that have welcomed google like oberstaufen has ?
i was not surprised because usually in germany you wait -lsb- to not draw attention to yourself -rsb- .

earlier , she warned bosnia it was falling behind in integrating with europe . us secretary of state hillary clinton has praised the decision by balkan nation serbia to return to talks with its breakaway province of kosovo , in an effort to resolve the long-running standoff over kosovo ’ s 2008 declaration of independence .
" that dialog can and will benefit people in kosovo and in serbia by addressing practical , day-to-day issues and the long-term relationship between you , " clinton said after talks with serbian president boris tadic in belgrade .
tadic , meanwhile , said serbia wanted " to be predictable partners , " adding that " only in that way will we rebuild trust . "
many serbians still remember clinton 's husband , former us president bill clinton , as the leader who supported the 1999 nato bombing that led to serbia 's withdrawal from kosovo .
praise for police clinton also used her visit to belgrade to praise serbian police for protecting a weekend gay pride march from attacks , as prosecutors opened a criminal investigation against the leader of a far-right group for orchestrating the violent anti-gay protests .
" i especially want to commend the bravery of the police who provided security for the event at last sunday 's pride parade , " clinton said .
" it was not easy , and yet we watched as the official law enforcement forces demonstrated unequivocally your support for the rights of all . "
more than 150 people were injured sunday in downtown belgrade in running battles with police as thousands of far-right demonstrators tried to disrupt the march by hurling molotov cocktails and stun grenades at police .
clinton : bosnia must do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton was welcomed by the serbian people earlier tuesday , clinton visited bosnia , where she warned the balkan country it was falling behind its neighbors in integrating with europe .
she said bosnia risked having its hopes of joining the european union and nato dashed unless it starts bridging its internal political and ethnic divide .
the country is ethnically divided along bosniak , serb and croat lines .
" hatreds have eased , but nationalism persists , " she said .
" meanwhile , the promise of greater stability and opportunity , represented by integration into europe , remains out of reach .
" your neighbors have taken strides in that direction , " clinton continued .
" now is the time for the citizens of this country to make your voices heard . "
clinton will travel to kosovo on wednesday on the second and final day of her diplomatic tour of the war-torn region .
she is expected to push the government in pristina to make the most of talks with serbia .
the us is among 70 states , including most of the 27 eu countries , to have recognized kosovo 's independence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.10.2010 germany 's khedira has gone from backup to bulwark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was germany 's heart and soul against turkey as a defensive stopper , sami khedira does n't post the sort of numbers that leap out at you from score sheets .
but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 12.10.2010 european commission to push member states to do more to help roma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has deported thousands of roma to romania this summer starting tuesday , romania is hosting a two-day conference of european nations to discuss how to help integrate roma travelers .
europe 's social affairs commissioner said financial help is available to member states . the european commission will once again push member states to do more to improve the situation for roma travelers on tuesday at a conference in bucharest .
the meeting was organized after the french government began its deportations of roma families over the summer , drawing international criticism .
the bucharest conference aims to promote the better use of eu funds to improve the socio-economic situation of the 10 to 12 million roma living on the continent .
they face discrimination , poverty , segregation , and barriers to education and the labor market in many of the european countries in which they settle .
in slovakia , for example , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education .
in bulgaria , over 50 percent of roma are unemployed .
in romania only about a quarter of roma have a steady job .
european funds are under-used in recent years the european union has brought in a comprehensive financial program to promote the integration of the roma and sinti travelers .
but romania and bulgaria , the eu member states with the biggest roma communities , have made little use of the subsidies .
despite the high-profile debate about integration of roma sparked by france 's crackdown on its traveling community , the european union 's commissioner for social affairs and inclusion complained recently that few nations are drawing on the available financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laszlo andor wants countries to make better use of european funds " i would like to stress that this is the responsibility of the european union and the member states together , " andor said in the european parliament .
" the structural funds offer a very useful financial lever for supporting national efforts to improve the situation of the roma .
however , eu funds are often not fully used , or not used in the most effective way . "
currently romania is only using 1 percent of the 2.25 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- made available by the european social fund between 2007 and 2013 to improve the situation of vulnerable groups .
bulgaria is only using 5 percent of the fund .
integration is not just about money however , there is of course no compulsion to use the money .
the german conservative mep manfred weber hopes there is enough incentive for countries to apply for the money if they need it .
" the decisive factor in integration of course is always that it ca n't be proscribed from above , rather it 's got to happen in the towns , in the communities themselves , " weber told deutsche welle .
" it demands creativity . "
the european commission has set up a working group to assess why the roma struggle so much with integration .
the group will deliver its findings by the end of the year .
in the meantime andor wants member states to set ambitious targets for tackling poverty and improving the educational horizons of the roma .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in slovakia , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education " it 's only about poverty reduction , it 's not only about social inclusion , " the commissioner said .
" we have to ensure that the roma are explicitly mentioned in our new employment flagship initiative , because that 's also where a breakthrough has to be made . "
manfred weber believes governments have to tackle the root of the problem by targeting education .
“ we have to follow through the idea that children of this ethnic minority must attend school .
only then can we succeed in truly integrating these travelling families into european societies . ”
the problems for the roma in europe are not new .
there is money available in europe to tackle it .
but it has taken the row over the policy of deporting roma from france to bring this much-beleaguered community into the spotlight .

but many observers say that its chances of succeeding are less than slim . in the current format , the un general assembly annually elects five new , non-permanent security council members to two-year terms to replace the five members that will leave the council at the end of december .
the 10 rotating seats are divided among five regions around the world .
only the united states , britain , france , russia and china hold permanent seats on the un security council and the power to veto all resolutions .
germany has been campaigning to join this elite group as part of a more comprehensive project to revamp the council for most of the past decade .
along with india , japan and brazil , germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the un system as part of the g-4 alliance .
the g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
under the alliance 's plan , four of the permanent six seats would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries .
germany 's determination to pursue its goal is supported by what many see as a justified attempt to receive recognition for its contribution to the modern un and more responsibility for a country of its international standing .
" germany is a significant player at the un , " richard gowan , an international relations expert at the european council on foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the mere fact that it pays 8 percent of the budget ensures that .
germany is a constructive voice not only on iran but on issues like peace-building in africa .
it 's a good citizen at the un . "
self-preservation at the heart of opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council continues to show a reluctance to change but after facing consistent opposition to individual and collective g-4 membership , germany 's efforts and that of the alliance appeared to have lost momentum in recent years , primarily due to the growing relationship between india and the united states , which has at times diverted new delhi 's focus , and japan 's insistence on evolving a formula that can not be opposed by the us .
washington 's opposition and that of other major powers to the g-4 plan has been a major stumbling block in recent years , while the so-called " coffee club " - an alliance of pakistan , italy , mexico , argentina , south korea and several other countries opposed to the g-4 - has also emerged as a rival to complicate the g-4 's attempts at reform .
" some permanent members of the security council , like china and russia , are suspicious of any reform that would dilute their power there , " said gowan . " within europe , italy is particularly opposed to germany 's ambitions . it fears that if germany won a permanent seat alongside britain and france , its own influence at the un would decline . "
" britain and france both have a strong rhetorical commitment to germany 's cause , " he added . " however , they will do nothing that compromises their own positions on the council . in the past , germany has campaigned for a permanent seat alongside japan , india and brazil . however , it is possible to imagine scenarios in which rapidly rising powers like brazil and india won permanent seats and germany and japan did not . " g-4 allies could be both a help and hindrance to germany with india set to rejuvenate the g-4 ahead of the 65th un general assembly with a series of meetings with alliance ministers aimed at getting the campaign back on-track , germany hopes a new vigor in the group 's collective efforts to reform the council can enhance its own campaign for a permanent seat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia prefers india and brazil as permanent members " but never underestimate how complex and nasty security council reform negotiations can become , " said gowan .
" the bloc politics are fantastically difficult .
germany also has to be realistic that , while its bid for a permanent seat is taken seriously , it 's actually peripheral to the question of whether india and japan should get such seats . " " the reasons are geopolitical : if india and japan were in the council full-time , it could become a serious center for debate on asian security issues .
it 's not clear whether china wants that .
germany 's presence would probably change the dynamics of the council rather less .
but it 's very hard to imagine a reform process that gave germany a permanent seat but exclude india . that would be political and historical lunacy . " experts unconvinced that german ambitions can be fulfilled a number of experts believe that germany is wasting its time to again lobby for a permanent seat , given the rise to prominence of other states in the geo-political arena , with some saying that the unlikelihood of success or the reform of the council could even persuade chancellor angela merkel to drop the campaign completely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the un : germany may have to accept defeat " it 's very unlikely that germany will try and resurrect their bid for a seat because there really is n't any hope of getting one , " michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" should the necessary reforms go through , the un will offer seats to the likes of india and brazil over germany , due to its policy of promoting the new powers and because of the over-representation of europe on the council . " " i would be very surprised if this attempt were to be successful , " dr. karen smith at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle .

but many observers say that its chances of succeeding are less than slim . in the current format , the un general assembly annually elects five new , non-permanent security council members to two-year terms to replace the five members that will leave the council at the end of december .
the 10 rotating seats are divided among five regions around the world .
only the united states , britain , france , russia and china hold permanent seats on the un security council and the power to veto all resolutions .
germany has been campaigning to join this elite group as part of a more comprehensive project to revamp the council for most of the past decade .
along with india , japan and brazil , germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the un system as part of the g-4 alliance .
the g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
under the alliance 's plan , four of the permanent six seats would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries .
germany 's determination to pursue its goal is supported by what many see as a justified attempt to receive recognition for its contribution to the modern un and more responsibility for a country of its international standing .
" germany is a significant player at the un , " richard gowan , an international relations expert at the european council on foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the mere fact that it pays 8 percent of the budget ensures that .
germany is a constructive voice not only on iran but on issues like peace-building in africa .
it 's a good citizen at the un . "
self-preservation at the heart of opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council continues to show a reluctance to change but after facing consistent opposition to individual and collective g-4 membership , germany 's efforts and that of the alliance appeared to have lost momentum in recent years , primarily due to the growing relationship between india and the united states , which has at times diverted new delhi 's focus , and japan 's insistence on evolving a formula that can not be opposed by the us .
washington 's opposition and that of other major powers to the g-4 plan has been a major stumbling block in recent years , while the so-called " coffee club " - an alliance of pakistan , italy , mexico , argentina , south korea and several other countries opposed to the g-4 - has also emerged as a rival to complicate the g-4 's attempts at reform .
" some permanent members of the security council , like china and russia , are suspicious of any reform that would dilute their power there , " said gowan . " within europe , italy is particularly opposed to germany 's ambitions . it fears that if germany won a permanent seat alongside britain and france , its own influence at the un would decline . "
" britain and france both have a strong rhetorical commitment to germany 's cause , " he added . " however , they will do nothing that compromises their own positions on the council . in the past , germany has campaigned for a permanent seat alongside japan , india and brazil . however , it is possible to imagine scenarios in which rapidly rising powers like brazil and india won permanent seats and germany and japan did not . " g-4 allies could be both a help and hindrance to germany with india set to rejuvenate the g-4 ahead of the 65th un general assembly with a series of meetings with alliance ministers aimed at getting the campaign back on-track , germany hopes a new vigor in the group 's collective efforts to reform the council can enhance its own campaign for a permanent seat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia prefers india and brazil as permanent members " but never underestimate how complex and nasty security council reform negotiations can become , " said gowan .
" the bloc politics are fantastically difficult .
germany also has to be realistic that , while its bid for a permanent seat is taken seriously , it 's actually peripheral to the question of whether india and japan should get such seats . " " the reasons are geopolitical : if india and japan were in the council full-time , it could become a serious center for debate on asian security issues .
it 's not clear whether china wants that .
germany 's presence would probably change the dynamics of the council rather less .
but it 's very hard to imagine a reform process that gave germany a permanent seat but exclude india . that would be political and historical lunacy . " experts unconvinced that german ambitions can be fulfilled a number of experts believe that germany is wasting its time to again lobby for a permanent seat , given the rise to prominence of other states in the geo-political arena , with some saying that the unlikelihood of success or the reform of the council could even persuade chancellor angela merkel to drop the campaign completely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the un : germany may have to accept defeat " it 's very unlikely that germany will try and resurrect their bid for a seat because there really is n't any hope of getting one , " michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" should the necessary reforms go through , the un will offer seats to the likes of india and brazil over germany , due to its policy of promoting the new powers and because of the over-representation of europe on the council . " " i would be very surprised if this attempt were to be successful , " dr. karen smith at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle .

but many observers say that its chances of succeeding are less than slim . in the current format , the un general assembly annually elects five new , non-permanent security council members to two-year terms to replace the five members that will leave the council at the end of december .
the 10 rotating seats are divided among five regions around the world .
only the united states , britain , france , russia and china hold permanent seats on the un security council and the power to veto all resolutions .
germany has been campaigning to join this elite group as part of a more comprehensive project to revamp the council for most of the past decade .
along with india , japan and brazil , germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the un system as part of the g-4 alliance .
the g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
under the alliance 's plan , four of the permanent six seats would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries .
germany 's determination to pursue its goal is supported by what many see as a justified attempt to receive recognition for its contribution to the modern un and more responsibility for a country of its international standing .
" germany is a significant player at the un , " richard gowan , an international relations expert at the european council on foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the mere fact that it pays 8 percent of the budget ensures that .
germany is a constructive voice not only on iran but on issues like peace-building in africa .
it 's a good citizen at the un . "
self-preservation at the heart of opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council continues to show a reluctance to change but after facing consistent opposition to individual and collective g-4 membership , germany 's efforts and that of the alliance appeared to have lost momentum in recent years , primarily due to the growing relationship between india and the united states , which has at times diverted new delhi 's focus , and japan 's insistence on evolving a formula that can not be opposed by the us .
washington 's opposition and that of other major powers to the g-4 plan has been a major stumbling block in recent years , while the so-called " coffee club " - an alliance of pakistan , italy , mexico , argentina , south korea and several other countries opposed to the g-4 - has also emerged as a rival to complicate the g-4 's attempts at reform .
" some permanent members of the security council , like china and russia , are suspicious of any reform that would dilute their power there , " said gowan . " within europe , italy is particularly opposed to germany 's ambitions . it fears that if germany won a permanent seat alongside britain and france , its own influence at the un would decline . "
" britain and france both have a strong rhetorical commitment to germany 's cause , " he added . " however , they will do nothing that compromises their own positions on the council . in the past , germany has campaigned for a permanent seat alongside japan , india and brazil . however , it is possible to imagine scenarios in which rapidly rising powers like brazil and india won permanent seats and germany and japan did not . " g-4 allies could be both a help and hindrance to germany with india set to rejuvenate the g-4 ahead of the 65th un general assembly with a series of meetings with alliance ministers aimed at getting the campaign back on-track , germany hopes a new vigor in the group 's collective efforts to reform the council can enhance its own campaign for a permanent seat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia prefers india and brazil as permanent members " but never underestimate how complex and nasty security council reform negotiations can become , " said gowan .
" the bloc politics are fantastically difficult .
germany also has to be realistic that , while its bid for a permanent seat is taken seriously , it 's actually peripheral to the question of whether india and japan should get such seats . " " the reasons are geopolitical : if india and japan were in the council full-time , it could become a serious center for debate on asian security issues .
it 's not clear whether china wants that .
germany 's presence would probably change the dynamics of the council rather less .
but it 's very hard to imagine a reform process that gave germany a permanent seat but exclude india . that would be political and historical lunacy . " experts unconvinced that german ambitions can be fulfilled a number of experts believe that germany is wasting its time to again lobby for a permanent seat , given the rise to prominence of other states in the geo-political arena , with some saying that the unlikelihood of success or the reform of the council could even persuade chancellor angela merkel to drop the campaign completely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the un : germany may have to accept defeat " it 's very unlikely that germany will try and resurrect their bid for a seat because there really is n't any hope of getting one , " michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" should the necessary reforms go through , the un will offer seats to the likes of india and brazil over germany , due to its policy of promoting the new powers and because of the over-representation of europe on the council . " " i would be very surprised if this attempt were to be successful , " dr. karen smith at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle .

but many observers say that its chances of succeeding are less than slim . in the current format , the un general assembly annually elects five new , non-permanent security council members to two-year terms to replace the five members that will leave the council at the end of december .
the 10 rotating seats are divided among five regions around the world .
only the united states , britain , france , russia and china hold permanent seats on the un security council and the power to veto all resolutions .
germany has been campaigning to join this elite group as part of a more comprehensive project to revamp the council for most of the past decade .
along with india , japan and brazil , germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the un system as part of the g-4 alliance .
the g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
under the alliance 's plan , four of the permanent six seats would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries .
germany 's determination to pursue its goal is supported by what many see as a justified attempt to receive recognition for its contribution to the modern un and more responsibility for a country of its international standing .
" germany is a significant player at the un , " richard gowan , an international relations expert at the european council on foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the mere fact that it pays 8 percent of the budget ensures that .
germany is a constructive voice not only on iran but on issues like peace-building in africa .
it 's a good citizen at the un . "
self-preservation at the heart of opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council continues to show a reluctance to change but after facing consistent opposition to individual and collective g-4 membership , germany 's efforts and that of the alliance appeared to have lost momentum in recent years , primarily due to the growing relationship between india and the united states , which has at times diverted new delhi 's focus , and japan 's insistence on evolving a formula that can not be opposed by the us .
washington 's opposition and that of other major powers to the g-4 plan has been a major stumbling block in recent years , while the so-called " coffee club " - an alliance of pakistan , italy , mexico , argentina , south korea and several other countries opposed to the g-4 - has also emerged as a rival to complicate the g-4 's attempts at reform .
" some permanent members of the security council , like china and russia , are suspicious of any reform that would dilute their power there , " said gowan . " within europe , italy is particularly opposed to germany 's ambitions . it fears that if germany won a permanent seat alongside britain and france , its own influence at the un would decline . "
" britain and france both have a strong rhetorical commitment to germany 's cause , " he added . " however , they will do nothing that compromises their own positions on the council . in the past , germany has campaigned for a permanent seat alongside japan , india and brazil . however , it is possible to imagine scenarios in which rapidly rising powers like brazil and india won permanent seats and germany and japan did not . " g-4 allies could be both a help and hindrance to germany with india set to rejuvenate the g-4 ahead of the 65th un general assembly with a series of meetings with alliance ministers aimed at getting the campaign back on-track , germany hopes a new vigor in the group 's collective efforts to reform the council can enhance its own campaign for a permanent seat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia prefers india and brazil as permanent members " but never underestimate how complex and nasty security council reform negotiations can become , " said gowan .
" the bloc politics are fantastically difficult .
germany also has to be realistic that , while its bid for a permanent seat is taken seriously , it 's actually peripheral to the question of whether india and japan should get such seats . " " the reasons are geopolitical : if india and japan were in the council full-time , it could become a serious center for debate on asian security issues .
it 's not clear whether china wants that .
germany 's presence would probably change the dynamics of the council rather less .
but it 's very hard to imagine a reform process that gave germany a permanent seat but exclude india . that would be political and historical lunacy . " experts unconvinced that german ambitions can be fulfilled a number of experts believe that germany is wasting its time to again lobby for a permanent seat , given the rise to prominence of other states in the geo-political arena , with some saying that the unlikelihood of success or the reform of the council could even persuade chancellor angela merkel to drop the campaign completely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the un : germany may have to accept defeat " it 's very unlikely that germany will try and resurrect their bid for a seat because there really is n't any hope of getting one , " michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" should the necessary reforms go through , the un will offer seats to the likes of india and brazil over germany , due to its policy of promoting the new powers and because of the over-representation of europe on the council . " " i would be very surprised if this attempt were to be successful , " dr. karen smith at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle .
" enlarging the permanent membership of the security council is , i would think , very unlikely to happen . " " the chances of germany getting a permanent seat with a veto comparable to france or britain 's are fairly low , " richard gowan concluded .
" but it could negotiate some sort of semi-permanent seat , one which only requires reelection once every five or 10 years , without a veto .
compromises of this sort have been on the table since the 2005 negotiations on security council reform , and are probably the most realistic option .

from stimulus to growth buoyant demand from abroad and economic stimulus are casting german industry in a positive light by international comparison .
for all the media criticism , german economic policy is better than its reputation , even if a broad growth agenda is still in its infancy .
above and beyond the austerity package already presented , government spending must be scrutinised for its contribution to growth .
tax breaks and subsidies need serious pruning , accompanied by income tax relief in the medium term , with windfall revenues being used to reduce deficits more quickly .
the risks inherent in the social welfare system must be brought under control and latent growth potential in the healthcare system leveraged .
labour policy should continue down the successful path of greater flexibilisation .
a better level of education and sufficient supply of skilled staff would generate consistently more economic momentum .
an integrated energy and climate policy remains an absolutely vital growth driver . our country has innovative minds !

germany is one of the most knowledge-intensive and innovative countries on earth .
in this study we focus on the innovative performance of its sixteen federal states with reference to eight indicators .
the most innovative states lie in the south , while the east trails in terms of absolute levels .
however , interdisciplinarity and regional industrial diversity cushion negative effects of structural change on the regions and offer alternative sources of sustained economic growth .
looking at the dynamic of innovation it is apparent that the states in the east of germany spearheaded by saxony are on the right course . germany : only modest decline in the current account surplus the german export momentum is currently benefiting from extremely dynamic world trade .
however , it is likely to ease significantly in h2 2010 and above all in 2011 .
in addition to the impact of this cyclical development the highly export-dependent german economy is also being hit by the adjustments in europe ’ s crisis-ridden countries , even though the strain on the german current account is likely to remain within bounds .
nevertheless , in the medium term germany ’ s large current account surplus needs to be reduced , as the origins of the crisis lay in undesirable structural developments on both sides , that is not only in current account deficits , but also in the reciprocal surpluses .
all in all , we expect that the german current account surplus will first widen from 5.0 % to 5 ½ % of gdp this year , before narrowing slowly , however .
in 2012 it could then stand at 4 ½ % . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de integration -pipe- 12.10.2010 turkish eu affairs minister tells turkish germans to integrate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bagis told turkish germans to accept german customs days after the leaders of germany and turkey pledged to cooperate more on the integration of germany 's substantial turkish minority , a turkish politician tells turkish germans integration is a responsibility . turkish european union affairs minister egemen bagis has called on turks in germany to better integrate themselves into german culture , inserting himself into a fierce and ongoing debate on the integration of germany 's turkish minority .
" learn german !
adjust to the customs of your host country , " he told daily newspaper bild in an interview published on tuesday .
" you do n't have to give up the gift of your identity and culture , but rather think of yourselves as ambassadors for turkey .
only then can you build bridges for a better friendship and partnership between our countries . "
three days before his comments were published , german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan met in berlin on the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between the two countries , pledging to cooperate more on integration of turks living in germany .
multi-faceted integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to work together on integration ines michalowski , a senior researcher at berlin 's social science research center , said the call for turkish-germans to maintain their culture while still adjusting to german customs may seem paradoxical , but that the two are not mutually exclusive .
" the turkish nation-state is a very nationalistic nation , where there are actually claims of turks belonging to the turkish nation-state even though they have been living abroad for several generations , " she told deutsche welle .
" but that does n't mean that integration on the labor market , or in the educational system , or contacts with germans - that these aspects of integration go badly . "
still , research shows that most turkish germans are poorly integrated in these areas - a fact which haci halil uslucan , director of the center for turkish studies and integration research , said can not be entirely attributed to a perceived lack of motivation of immigrants to integrate themselves .
" i think we also have to focus on the conditions of being integrated - and that means the attitudes of the majority , the look of the majority on the minority , " he told deutsche welle .
" the political discussion should not go in this direction of creating ranks - these are the good immigrants and these are the bad ones .
that only increases social tension . "
education is key bagis also said in his interview that turkish-german parents should send their children " to the best schools , so that they have a future , " echoing comments by prime minister erdogan that turkish-germans should prioritize education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research shows other minorities have integrated better than turks michalowski said studies of vietnamese immigrant parents in the eastern state of brandenburg have shown their children to have higher high-school graduation and college entrance rates than non-immigrant german children , partly because the parents place a high priority on education .
" some of the criticism has been that maybe turkish parents are not putting enough emphasis on getting a good education within germany , " she said .
" so if there is a government official from turkey who actually encourages people to pay more attention to the education of their children , i think that can never do any harm . "
but uslucan said other research shows that turkish-german parents have high educational aspirations for their children , and that teachers often send young turkish students to lower-level high schools that do not feed into universities , even when their educational performance is as good as their non-turkish peers .
" the doctrine must be that turkish parents should have more information about the german educational system , " he said .
" i think there is the problem that turkish parents do n't have enough information on what the best school is . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has made entry into the eu a high priority ambassadors for turkish eu accession in addition to his post as eu affairs minister , bagis is also chiefly responsible for negotiating turkey 's accession into the bloc .
while merkel has called turkey 's accession process " open-ended with no guarantees , " the turkish government has made it a high priority .
michalowski said bagis 's call on immigrants to integrate could be seen as a way of enhancing turkey 's chances of gaining eu membership .
" if you have a well-integrated minority , people in germany may be more favorable to the idea of turkey becoming a member of the european union than if the turkish community is always in the media as being badly integrated , " she said .

the two-day conference is being held in the romanian capital , bucharest . european union officials , romanian politicians and roma representatives are discussing integration issues regarding europe 's roma population at a two-day eu conference held in romania 's capital , bucharest .
the conference is aimed at finding solutions on how to achieve more with the money spent by the european union on integrating roma , said the european commissioner for employment and social affairs , laszlo andor , at the opening of the conference .
" a lot has been done in terms of strategic planning , coordination and implementation , but at the end of the day , not much has really changed . " he said .
andor wants eu member states to become more engaged in integrating their roma population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " not much has really changed " - andor said at the conference " the eu can not solve the multi-layered problems of the roma by itself , " he said .
" the european union is ready to step up its efforts for roma integration , but that is also what we expect from all member states . "
funding is available , yet few members take the money even though the european union has funds available , member states refrain from using the money .
from 2007 until 2013 , the european social fund offered 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.1 billion -rrb- to help finance education and housing projects for roma .
especially countries with a high number of roma population like hungary , bulgaria and romania were expected make use of the funds .
the eu has installed a task force in order to find out why member states do not act even though the funds are available .
the task force is expected to present its results by the end of this year .
hungarian prime minister viktor orban said that the integration of roma would be one of the main focuses in hungary 's term in the eu presidency beginning in january .
according to andor , france 's drastic measures of expelling thousands of roma were " very unfortunate " , but " ironically energized the discussions on roma inclusion . "
problem of roma integration will not affect schengen talks german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting romanian prime minister emil boc that the problem of roma integration would not affect negotiations on romania becoming part of the schengen zone .
being a country within the schengen treaty would give romanian citizen visa-free travel within the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a long way from the end of the road , " - according to chancellor merkel merkel said that germany would judge romania 's development on their way to the schengen treaty fairly - but did not promise a quick entrance to the schengen zone .
" the reforms of the judiciary and of interior affairs are being tackled very courageously , but you are still a long way from the end of the road , " merkel said . " we back romania 's efforts to join the schengen zone ... but we must make sure that visa delivery procedures are not marred by corruption , " she said .
it is crucial that romania only issue visas without signs of corruption or unregularities and that eu 's external borders are safe .
" there are no reasonable alternatives to transparent and clear legal terms . " romania is hoping to enter the schengen zone in the middle of 2011 .
the country has been a member of the eu since 2007 .
most of europe 's roma are said to live in romania , but there are no reliable numbers - with figures ranging from a population of 530,000 up to 2.5 million .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.10.2010 germany 's khedira has gone from backup to bulwark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was germany 's heart and soul against turkey as a defensive stopper , sami khedira does n't post the sort of numbers that leap out at you from score sheets .
but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

however , one city in the southern state of bavaria , oberstaufen , has publicly supported google street view - and may be the only city in the country that has supported the company to such a great degree .
in an interview with deutsche welle , bianca keybach , the head of oberstaufen 's tourist office , explained why the city even went so far as to bake for google .
deutsche welle : oberstaufen made a video and even baked a cake for google .
is that right ? bianca keybach : yes , we made a cake for google to welcome them and we put it into our facebook fan page and afterward we sent an invitation to google to say that we would be glad to welcome them here , and then google contacted us and we will see what happens .
when google contacted you , what happened ?
they were thankful for being so positive because this was a very big discussion in germany , -lsb- due to privacy -rsb- and taking pictures and everybody says we do n't want that .
we were one of the towns that said we would like -lsb- street view -rsb- .
tell me why you want google taking street view photographs in your town ?
what do you hope to accomplish other than to show how great the town is ?
i think that it would be an additional service for our guests .
when they are choosing a hotel or reading our brochures or they look at our homepage and they ca n't really say if everything is true , if there is a big street next to the hotel .
with google street view they can look into the town and discover the street , discover the region and after the holidays they can show their family and friends where they have been and what they can recommend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bianca keybach is the head of oberstaufen 's tourism office google has sent out their street view vehicles to big cities around germany , and they 're going to be releasing the photos for the 20 biggest cities around germany later this year .
have they actually sent a car to oberstaufen ?
they 've been here last year or at the beginning of this year .
they were in oberstaufen .
nobody saw them , though .
they took pictures and they have them and we 'll all waiting if there 's any chance that we can go on street view as soon as possible .
some have argued against street view because they say criminals could use it to plan robberies .
do you think that 's a valid argument ?
that 's a very interesting argument , because it 's one of the most important arguments for the critics but i think it 's crazy because the pictures were taken five or 10 months ago and they will be online for five or 10 years .
but if i want to get into a house and commit a crime , i wo n't use a picture that is many years old .
i could just use a postcard , for example , as a basis for burglary .
i think that 's not very realistic , but it 's very nice for a symbolic discussion .
are you surprised that there have n't been more cities that have welcomed google like oberstaufen has ?
i was not surprised because usually in germany you wait -lsb- to not draw attention to yourself -rsb- .
as long as you 're waiting , nobody is criticizing you .
i think it 's german , and it 's normal that no other towns really said , " we like google and we welcome google and we see a lot of positive aspects in this theme . "
after we said we like google and we support google street view , in our region , other towns and villages said , " we like would like to have them here , but you have to be the pioneer . "
we are glad that we decided to be very open .
now you mentioned earlier that you sent google a cake .
what kind of cake was it ?
i think it was a chocolate cake that was covered in frosting .
we just took a picture of the cake and sent the picture by e-mail , by twitter and we put it on facebook and we sent a real invitation that as soon as they come to take the other pictures of oberstaufen we will welcome them with the original cake .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 12.10.2010 german economics minister warns of ' trade war ' with china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle arrived in china on tuesday economics minister rainer bruederle began his two-day trip to china with warnings of a " trade war . "
he is hoping his visit will help promote “ sensible arrangements . ”
but observers are skeptical . economics minister rainer bruederle has framed his two-day trip to china , which began in beijing on tuesday , as a pacifying mission , following recent acrimony between china and many g-20 countries over trade .
" the danger of a trade war has appeared on the horizon , " bruederle told reporters traveling with him on his two-day trip to china , which is to include stops in beijing and shanghai .
the minister warned that accusations of currency manipulation should not be allowed to escalate , and protectionism must be avoided .
some of china 's trading partners in the us and europe have recently accused beijing of allowing the yuan to depreciate at a faster pace .
critics say the unit could be undervalued by as much as 40 percent .
ambassador and missionary speaking in beijing , bruederle refuted these claims , pointing out that the yuan had increased in value by 15 to 17 percent in the past two years , and he added that he did not expect the chinese government to adopt flexible trading patterns in the future .
" we must not allow the situation to get out of hand , or turn our backs on free trade , " bruederle said , adding that he saw himself as an " ambassador , perhaps even a missionary , for the fight against protectionism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has faced pressure from the eu over currency depreciation bruederle expressed satisfaction with the state of german-chinese trade , which has grown significantly this year .
german exports to china have grown by 52 percent to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of this year , while chinese exports have risen by 34 percent , compared to 2009 figures .
germany is considered one of china 's best friends in the west .
" the germans have been pushing for an open trade policy towards china , " jonathan holslag of the brussels institute of contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" germany 's economic revival after the financial crisis has been - to a large degree - made in china . "
" most of the expansion in germany 's exports – particularly cars and machinery – has been bound for china , " says holslag .
for this reason , holslag believes , the german government has often cautioned against protectionism towards china .
" angela merkel has also openly expressed her support for granting china market economy status , " holslag points out .
" this would make it more difficult for the european commission to apply anti-dumping procedures . "
good on the small-scale , not so much on the large-scale but despite germany 's huge economic interest in china – not only through exports , but also through direct investment from individual companies – bruederle 's leverage during this trip is likely to be limited .
the minister said that one of his main aims for the trip was to ensure that medium-sized german businesses gained better opportunities in china .
after his meetings with chinese commerce minister chen deming and zhang ping , the head of the country 's top economic planning agency , bruederle said he had been assured that german companies could take part in open competition in china provided they used a minimum of 50 percent local products .
but holslag believes this is a secondary priority for bruederle compared to maintaining export agreements .
" it 's important to distinguish degrees of urgency , " he says .
" the most important objective for the german government is to step up exports , and the second level is access to the chinese market .
germany is likely to be very cautious in negotiations , in order to protect exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery has been largely based on exports to china but despite this , there is concern that german companies are being disadvantaged by the chinese government .
rolf langhammer , vice-president of the kiel institute for the world economy , believes that this is where bruederle can at least make sure german businesses can get their voices heard .
" germany enjoys a very good position in china compared to other european countries , but of course there are barriers to mid-sized german companies , " he told deutsche welle .
" a lot of representatives of these firms are accompanying bruederle . "
langhammer does not think that bruederle can apply much pressure on the question of global exchange rates – the issue he addressed on arrival .
" the chinese government has always made clear that it wo n't let itself be influenced on this subject , and bruederle 's visit wo n't change anything in the discussion about the exchange rate . "
langhammer is also unconvinced by bruederle 's attempt to position himself as a mediator between the china and the west .
" that 's a role he can not play , " he says .
" he is much too small for that .
he does n't speak for the eurozone , he speaks for an export country called germany .
of course he can represent the interests of mid-sized companies , and he can voice their concerns if they feel themselves disadvantaged alongside chinese competition , but he ca n't solve the big questions – and he ca n't be a mediator in them . "

earlier , she warned bosnia it was falling behind in integrating with europe . us secretary of state hillary clinton has praised the decision by balkan nation serbia to return to talks with its breakaway province of kosovo , in an effort to resolve the long-running standoff over kosovo ’ s 2008 declaration of independence .
" that dialog can and will benefit people in kosovo and in serbia by addressing practical , day-to-day issues and the long-term relationship between you , " clinton said after talks with serbian president boris tadic in belgrade .
tadic , meanwhile , said serbia wanted " to be predictable partners , " adding that " only in that way will we rebuild trust . "
many serbians still remember clinton 's husband , former us president bill clinton , as the leader who supported the 1999 nato bombing that led to serbia 's withdrawal from kosovo .
praise for police clinton also used her visit to belgrade to praise serbian police for protecting a weekend gay pride march from attacks , as prosecutors opened a criminal investigation against the leader of a far-right group for orchestrating the violent anti-gay protests .
" i especially want to commend the bravery of the police who provided security for the event at last sunday 's pride parade , " clinton said .
" it was not easy , and yet we watched as the official law enforcement forces demonstrated unequivocally your support for the rights of all . "
more than 150 people were injured sunday in downtown belgrade in running battles with police as thousands of far-right demonstrators tried to disrupt the march by hurling molotov cocktails and stun grenades at police .
clinton : bosnia must do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton was welcomed by the serbian people earlier tuesday , clinton visited bosnia , where she warned the balkan country it was falling behind its neighbors in integrating with europe .
she said bosnia risked having its hopes of joining the european union and nato dashed unless it starts bridging its internal political and ethnic divide .
the country is ethnically divided along bosniak , serb and croat lines .
" hatreds have eased , but nationalism persists , " she said .
" meanwhile , the promise of greater stability and opportunity , represented by integration into europe , remains out of reach .
" your neighbors have taken strides in that direction , " clinton continued .
" now is the time for the citizens of this country to make your voices heard . "
clinton will travel to kosovo on wednesday on the second and final day of her diplomatic tour of the war-torn region .
she is expected to push the government in pristina to make the most of talks with serbia .
the us is among 70 states , including most of the 27 eu countries , to have recognized kosovo 's independence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.10.2010 germany 's khedira has gone from backup to bulwark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was germany 's heart and soul against turkey as a defensive stopper , sami khedira does n't post the sort of numbers that leap out at you from score sheets .
but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

"
he is hoping his visit will help promote “ sensible arrangements . ”
but observers are skeptical . economics minister rainer bruederle has framed his two-day trip to china , which began in beijing on tuesday , as a pacifying mission , following recent acrimony between china and many g-20 countries over trade .
" the danger of a trade war has appeared on the horizon , " bruederle told reporters traveling with him on his two-day trip to china , which is to include stops in beijing and shanghai .
the minister warned that accusations of currency manipulation should not be allowed to escalate , and protectionism must be avoided .
some of china 's trading partners in the us and europe have recently accused beijing of allowing the yuan to depreciate at a faster pace .
critics say the unit could be undervalued by as much as 40 percent .
ambassador and missionary speaking in beijing , bruederle refuted these claims , pointing out that the yuan had increased in value by 15 to 17 percent in the past two years , and he added that he did not expect the chinese government to adopt flexible trading patterns in the future .
" we must not allow the situation to get out of hand , or turn our backs on free trade , " bruederle said , adding that he saw himself as an " ambassador , perhaps even a missionary , for the fight against protectionism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has faced pressure from the eu over currency depreciation bruederle expressed satisfaction with the state of german-chinese trade , which has grown significantly this year .
german exports to china have grown by 52 percent to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of this year , while chinese exports have risen by 34 percent , compared to 2009 figures .
germany is considered one of china 's best friends in the west .
" the germans have been pushing for an open trade policy towards china , " jonathan holslag of the brussels institute of contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" germany 's economic revival after the financial crisis has been - to a large degree - made in china . "
" most of the expansion in germany 's exports – particularly cars and machinery – has been bound for china , " says holslag .
for this reason , holslag believes , the german government has often cautioned against protectionism towards china .
" angela merkel has also openly expressed her support for granting china market economy status , " holslag points out .
" this would make it more difficult for the european commission to apply anti-dumping procedures . "
good on the small-scale , not so much on the large-scale but despite germany 's huge economic interest in china – not only through exports , but also through direct investment from individual companies – bruederle 's leverage during this trip is likely to be limited .
the minister said that one of his main aims for the trip was to ensure that medium-sized german businesses gained better opportunities in china .
after his meetings with chinese commerce minister chen deming and zhang ping , the head of the country 's top economic planning agency , bruederle said he had been assured that german companies could take part in open competition in china provided they used a minimum of 50 percent local products .
but holslag believes this is a secondary priority for bruederle compared to maintaining export agreements .
" it 's important to distinguish degrees of urgency , " he says .
" the most important objective for the german government is to step up exports , and the second level is access to the chinese market .
germany is likely to be very cautious in negotiations , in order to protect exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery has been largely based on exports to china but despite this , there is concern that german companies are being disadvantaged by the chinese government .
rolf langhammer , vice-president of the kiel institute for the world economy , believes that this is where bruederle can at least make sure german businesses can get their voices heard .
" germany enjoys a very good position in china compared to other european countries , but of course there are barriers to mid-sized german companies , " he told deutsche welle .
" a lot of representatives of these firms are accompanying bruederle . "
langhammer does not think that bruederle can apply much pressure on the question of global exchange rates – the issue he addressed on arrival .
" the chinese government has always made clear that it wo n't let itself be influenced on this subject , and bruederle 's visit wo n't change anything in the discussion about the exchange rate . "
langhammer is also unconvinced by bruederle 's attempt to position himself as a mediator between the china and the west .
" that 's a role he can not play , " he says .
" he is much too small for that .
he does n't speak for the eurozone , he speaks for an export country called germany .
of course he can represent the interests of mid-sized companies , and he can voice their concerns if they feel themselves disadvantaged alongside chinese competition , but he ca n't solve the big questions – and he ca n't be a mediator in them . "

earlier , she warned bosnia it was falling behind in integrating with europe . us secretary of state hillary clinton has praised the decision by balkan nation serbia to return to talks with its breakaway province of kosovo , in an effort to resolve the long-running standoff over kosovo ’ s 2008 declaration of independence .
" that dialog can and will benefit people in kosovo and in serbia by addressing practical , day-to-day issues and the long-term relationship between you , " clinton said after talks with serbian president boris tadic in belgrade .
tadic , meanwhile , said serbia wanted " to be predictable partners , " adding that " only in that way will we rebuild trust . "
many serbians still remember clinton 's husband , former us president bill clinton , as the leader who supported the 1999 nato bombing that led to serbia 's withdrawal from kosovo .
praise for police clinton also used her visit to belgrade to praise serbian police for protecting a weekend gay pride march from attacks , as prosecutors opened a criminal investigation against the leader of a far-right group for orchestrating the violent anti-gay protests .
" i especially want to commend the bravery of the police who provided security for the event at last sunday 's pride parade , " clinton said .
" it was not easy , and yet we watched as the official law enforcement forces demonstrated unequivocally your support for the rights of all . "
more than 150 people were injured sunday in downtown belgrade in running battles with police as thousands of far-right demonstrators tried to disrupt the march by hurling molotov cocktails and stun grenades at police .
clinton : bosnia must do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton was welcomed by the serbian people earlier tuesday , clinton visited bosnia , where she warned the balkan country it was falling behind its neighbors in integrating with europe .
she said bosnia risked having its hopes of joining the european union and nato dashed unless it starts bridging its internal political and ethnic divide .
the country is ethnically divided along bosniak , serb and croat lines .
" hatreds have eased , but nationalism persists , " she said .
" meanwhile , the promise of greater stability and opportunity , represented by integration into europe , remains out of reach .
" your neighbors have taken strides in that direction , " clinton continued .
" now is the time for the citizens of this country to make your voices heard . "
clinton will travel to kosovo on wednesday on the second and final day of her diplomatic tour of the war-torn region .
she is expected to push the government in pristina to make the most of talks with serbia .
the us is among 70 states , including most of the 27 eu countries , to have recognized kosovo 's independence .

but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

its creator , michaela melian , wanted to forge a memorial that would draw the attention of young people and pervade the city . what are memorials , and is it important that they occupy public space ?
certainly they 're a call to remembrance and reflection , but does a " digital memorial " leave out something important by letting people choose when they observe it ?
in munich , an audio map titled memory loops by artist and musician michaela melian has raised questions like these .
the project is a digital memorial to the victims of national socialism in the bavarian capital .
it draws on archival and audio footage relating to the holocaust and can be accessed online in both german and english .
melian 's project arose from a juried competition in munich seeking new forms of remembrance for nazi victims .
the event was meant to address a city monument that had become obscure due to increasing car traffic nearby .
" memory loops analyzes the most varied historical dimensions by focusing on certain crystallization points in the city of munich .
using archival material and contemporary witness statements , melian artistically shapes voice-collages of the highest quality , " noted the jury .
but the idea also had detractors , including munich 's mayor , christian ude .
he reacted to melian 's proposal in 2008 by wondering whether " its means can be used to achieve an appropriate memorial . "
young voices two years later , the project has been opened and is accessible online as of late september 2010 -lrb- see the link to memory loops below -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michaela melian wanted the memory loops project to appeal to young audiences melian drew from newspapers and holocaust archives and conducted interviews personally to accumulate the material for the project .
then she sought out actors - especially children and other young voices - to speak and record the accounts she found .
" i really wanted the files to sound like young people , " explained melian .
" many victims were young when they left the camps or returned from russia . "
the stories reflect their daily struggles and the nazi regime 's gradual expansion of control over their lives .
one victim 's account is tagged to the address sonnenstrasse 116 , just beyond the city center : " once , there was an air raid warning as i was out in town and wearing the star .
i wanted to go down into a shelter nearby , but they did n't let the jew boy in .
the old botanical garden is a stone 's throw away .
i hid under a shrub and cried - bombs were falling left and right . "
atmospheric music the short audio files are linked to a map indicating where each scene actually occurred .
michaela melian composed the music that accompanies many of their statements , taking inspiration from jewish musicians and composers who collided with nazi ideology during that period .
" karl amadeus hartmann was forbidden from working back then , coco schumann was prevented from performing , and mendelssohn-bartholdy could only be performed by jewish musicians for jewish audiences , " said melian .
" those are facets of the story that i wanted to include in the audio files in a subliminal way . "
a city-wide memorial at the memory loops homepage , visitors can click on 175 blue circles in the english version - and 300 in the german edition - to hear the stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project is also available as an audio guide for mobile phones the project is also being supported by broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk and will be presented as a series of radio programs .
some munich museums are lending their support as well by making mp3 players available with which people can tour the city and hear the stories as they go .
a similar version in english can be downloaded and installed on smart phones .
memory loops is , then , a kind of monument that is spread out across the city .
" i wanted to use the media that occupy nearly all of young people 's free time as well as their working lives : the internet and cell phones .
these days , many young people spend more time on the internet than at any social or public places , " melian said .
intimate glimpses into history munich was a center of activity for the nazi party .
that 's why the city is particularly revealing for those who want to understand the forms of persecution to which nazi victims were subjected and what their lives were like .
" in 1935 , we had to leave the apartment and moved to a cheap and dark ground-floor apartment on trogerstrasse -lsb- troger street -rsb- .
it was very close to where hitler lived .
coming home from church once , we saw him in an open mercedes .
my father said to us , ' a little bomb would be just the thing here , " ' recalls one voice in the memory loops project .
it continues , " we lived extremely modestly .
the other boys at school had it pretty good at home - suddenly , their families had jobs and work , and of course their children were all in the hitler youth .
i had to keep quiet about how things were at home with me . "

but many observers say that its chances of succeeding are less than slim . in the current format , the un general assembly annually elects five new , non-permanent security council members to two-year terms to replace the five members that will leave the council at the end of december .
the 10 rotating seats are divided among five regions around the world .
only the united states , britain , france , russia and china hold permanent seats on the un security council and the power to veto all resolutions .
germany has been campaigning to join this elite group as part of a more comprehensive project to revamp the council for most of the past decade .
along with india , japan and brazil , germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the un system as part of the g-4 alliance .
the g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
under the alliance 's plan , four of the permanent six seats would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries .
germany 's determination to pursue its goal is supported by what many see as a justified attempt to receive recognition for its contribution to the modern un and more responsibility for a country of its international standing .
" germany is a significant player at the un , " richard gowan , an international relations expert at the european council on foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the mere fact that it pays 8 percent of the budget ensures that .
germany is a constructive voice not only on iran but on issues like peace-building in africa .
it 's a good citizen at the un . "
self-preservation at the heart of opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council continues to show a reluctance to change but after facing consistent opposition to individual and collective g-4 membership , germany 's efforts and that of the alliance appeared to have lost momentum in recent years , primarily due to the growing relationship between india and the united states , which has at times diverted new delhi 's focus , and japan 's insistence on evolving a formula that can not be opposed by the us .
washington 's opposition and that of other major powers to the g-4 plan has been a major stumbling block in recent years , while the so-called " coffee club " - an alliance of pakistan , italy , mexico , argentina , south korea and several other countries opposed to the g-4 - has also emerged as a rival to complicate the g-4 's attempts at reform .
" some permanent members of the security council , like china and russia , are suspicious of any reform that would dilute their power there , " said gowan . " within europe , italy is particularly opposed to germany 's ambitions . it fears that if germany won a permanent seat alongside britain and france , its own influence at the un would decline . "
" britain and france both have a strong rhetorical commitment to germany 's cause , " he added . " however , they will do nothing that compromises their own positions on the council . in the past , germany has campaigned for a permanent seat alongside japan , india and brazil . however , it is possible to imagine scenarios in which rapidly rising powers like brazil and india won permanent seats and germany and japan did not . " g-4 allies could be both a help and hindrance to germany with india set to rejuvenate the g-4 ahead of the 65th un general assembly with a series of meetings with alliance ministers aimed at getting the campaign back on-track , germany hopes a new vigor in the group 's collective efforts to reform the council can enhance its own campaign for a permanent seat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia prefers india and brazil as permanent members " but never underestimate how complex and nasty security council reform negotiations can become , " said gowan .
" the bloc politics are fantastically difficult .
germany also has to be realistic that , while its bid for a permanent seat is taken seriously , it 's actually peripheral to the question of whether india and japan should get such seats . " " the reasons are geopolitical : if india and japan were in the council full-time , it could become a serious center for debate on asian security issues .
it 's not clear whether china wants that .
germany 's presence would probably change the dynamics of the council rather less .
but it 's very hard to imagine a reform process that gave germany a permanent seat but exclude india . that would be political and historical lunacy . " experts unconvinced that german ambitions can be fulfilled a number of experts believe that germany is wasting its time to again lobby for a permanent seat , given the rise to prominence of other states in the geo-political arena , with some saying that the unlikelihood of success or the reform of the council could even persuade chancellor angela merkel to drop the campaign completely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the un : germany may have to accept defeat " it 's very unlikely that germany will try and resurrect their bid for a seat because there really is n't any hope of getting one , " michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" should the necessary reforms go through , the un will offer seats to the likes of india and brazil over germany , due to its policy of promoting the new powers and because of the over-representation of europe on the council . " " i would be very surprised if this attempt were to be successful , " dr. karen smith at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle .
" enlarging the permanent membership of the security council is , i would think , very unlikely to happen . " " the chances of germany getting a permanent seat with a veto comparable to france or britain 's are fairly low , " richard gowan concluded .
" but it could negotiate some sort of semi-permanent seat , one which only requires reelection once every five or 10 years , without a veto .
compromises of this sort have been on the table since the 2005 negotiations on security council reform , and are probably the most realistic option .

however , one city in the southern state of bavaria , oberstaufen , has publicly supported google street view - and may be the only city in the country that has supported the company to such a great degree .
in an interview with deutsche welle , bianca keybach , the head of oberstaufen 's tourist office , explained why the city even went so far as to bake for google .
deutsche welle : oberstaufen made a video and even baked a cake for google .
is that right ? bianca keybach : yes , we made a cake for google to welcome them and we put it into our facebook fan page and afterward we sent an invitation to google to say that we would be glad to welcome them here , and then google contacted us and we will see what happens .
when google contacted you , what happened ?
they were thankful for being so positive because this was a very big discussion in germany , -lsb- due to privacy -rsb- and taking pictures and everybody says we do n't want that .
we were one of the towns that said we would like -lsb- street view -rsb- .
tell me why you want google taking street view photographs in your town ?
what do you hope to accomplish other than to show how great the town is ?
i think that it would be an additional service for our guests .
when they are choosing a hotel or reading our brochures or they look at our homepage and they ca n't really say if everything is true , if there is a big street next to the hotel .
with google street view they can look into the town and discover the street , discover the region and after the holidays they can show their family and friends where they have been and what they can recommend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bianca keybach is the head of oberstaufen 's tourism office google has sent out their street view vehicles to big cities around germany , and they 're going to be releasing the photos for the 20 biggest cities around germany later this year .
have they actually sent a car to oberstaufen ?
they 've been here last year or at the beginning of this year .
they were in oberstaufen .
nobody saw them , though .
they took pictures and they have them and we 'll all waiting if there 's any chance that we can go on street view as soon as possible .
some have argued against street view because they say criminals could use it to plan robberies .
do you think that 's a valid argument ?
that 's a very interesting argument , because it 's one of the most important arguments for the critics but i think it 's crazy because the pictures were taken five or 10 months ago and they will be online for five or 10 years .
but if i want to get into a house and commit a crime , i wo n't use a picture that is many years old .
i could just use a postcard , for example , as a basis for burglary .
i think that 's not very realistic , but it 's very nice for a symbolic discussion .
are you surprised that there have n't been more cities that have welcomed google like oberstaufen has ?
i was not surprised because usually in germany you wait -lsb- to not draw attention to yourself -rsb- .
as long as you 're waiting , nobody is criticizing you .
i think it 's german , and it 's normal that no other towns really said , " we like google and we welcome google and we see a lot of positive aspects in this theme . "
after we said we like google and we support google street view , in our region , other towns and villages said , " we like would like to have them here , but you have to be the pioneer . "
we are glad that we decided to be very open .
now you mentioned earlier that you sent google a cake .
what kind of cake was it ?
i think it was a chocolate cake that was covered in frosting .
we just took a picture of the cake and sent the picture by e-mail , by twitter and we put it on facebook and we sent a real invitation that as soon as they come to take the other pictures of oberstaufen we will welcome them with the original cake .

but many observers say that its chances of succeeding are less than slim . in the current format , the un general assembly annually elects five new , non-permanent security council members to two-year terms to replace the five members that will leave the council at the end of december .
the 10 rotating seats are divided among five regions around the world .
only the united states , britain , france , russia and china hold permanent seats on the un security council and the power to veto all resolutions .
germany has been campaigning to join this elite group as part of a more comprehensive project to revamp the council for most of the past decade .
along with india , japan and brazil , germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the un system as part of the g-4 alliance .
the g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
under the alliance 's plan , four of the permanent six seats would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries .
germany 's determination to pursue its goal is supported by what many see as a justified attempt to receive recognition for its contribution to the modern un and more responsibility for a country of its international standing .
" germany is a significant player at the un , " richard gowan , an international relations expert at the european council on foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the mere fact that it pays 8 percent of the budget ensures that .
germany is a constructive voice not only on iran but on issues like peace-building in africa .
it 's a good citizen at the un . "
self-preservation at the heart of opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council continues to show a reluctance to change but after facing consistent opposition to individual and collective g-4 membership , germany 's efforts and that of the alliance appeared to have lost momentum in recent years , primarily due to the growing relationship between india and the united states , which has at times diverted new delhi 's focus , and japan 's insistence on evolving a formula that can not be opposed by the us .
washington 's opposition and that of other major powers to the g-4 plan has been a major stumbling block in recent years , while the so-called " coffee club " - an alliance of pakistan , italy , mexico , argentina , south korea and several other countries opposed to the g-4 - has also emerged as a rival to complicate the g-4 's attempts at reform .
" some permanent members of the security council , like china and russia , are suspicious of any reform that would dilute their power there , " said gowan . " within europe , italy is particularly opposed to germany 's ambitions . it fears that if germany won a permanent seat alongside britain and france , its own influence at the un would decline . "
" britain and france both have a strong rhetorical commitment to germany 's cause , " he added . " however , they will do nothing that compromises their own positions on the council . in the past , germany has campaigned for a permanent seat alongside japan , india and brazil . however , it is possible to imagine scenarios in which rapidly rising powers like brazil and india won permanent seats and germany and japan did not . " g-4 allies could be both a help and hindrance to germany with india set to rejuvenate the g-4 ahead of the 65th un general assembly with a series of meetings with alliance ministers aimed at getting the campaign back on-track , germany hopes a new vigor in the group 's collective efforts to reform the council can enhance its own campaign for a permanent seat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia prefers india and brazil as permanent members " but never underestimate how complex and nasty security council reform negotiations can become , " said gowan .
" the bloc politics are fantastically difficult .
germany also has to be realistic that , while its bid for a permanent seat is taken seriously , it 's actually peripheral to the question of whether india and japan should get such seats . " " the reasons are geopolitical : if india and japan were in the council full-time , it could become a serious center for debate on asian security issues .
it 's not clear whether china wants that .
germany 's presence would probably change the dynamics of the council rather less .
but it 's very hard to imagine a reform process that gave germany a permanent seat but exclude india . that would be political and historical lunacy . " experts unconvinced that german ambitions can be fulfilled a number of experts believe that germany is wasting its time to again lobby for a permanent seat , given the rise to prominence of other states in the geo-political arena , with some saying that the unlikelihood of success or the reform of the council could even persuade chancellor angela merkel to drop the campaign completely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the un : germany may have to accept defeat " it 's very unlikely that germany will try and resurrect their bid for a seat because there really is n't any hope of getting one , " michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" should the necessary reforms go through , the un will offer seats to the likes of india and brazil over germany , due to its policy of promoting the new powers and because of the over-representation of europe on the council . " " i would be very surprised if this attempt were to be successful , " dr. karen smith at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle .
" enlarging the permanent membership of the security council is , i would think , very unlikely to happen . " " the chances of germany getting a permanent seat with a veto comparable to france or britain 's are fairly low , " richard gowan concluded .
" but it could negotiate some sort of semi-permanent seat , one which only requires reelection once every five or 10 years , without a veto .
compromises of this sort have been on the table since the 2005 negotiations on security council reform , and are probably the most realistic option .

along with india , japan and brazil , germany has been pushing for an overhaul of the un system as part of the g-4 alliance .
the g-4 group has been calling for the addition of six permanent seats to the council without the power of veto , and a further four non-permanent seats .
under the alliance 's plan , four of the permanent six seats would go to germany , japan , india and brazil , with the other two reserved for unspecified african countries .
germany 's determination to pursue its goal is supported by what many see as a justified attempt to receive recognition for its contribution to the modern un and more responsibility for a country of its international standing .
" germany is a significant player at the un , " richard gowan , an international relations expert at the european council on foreign affairs , told deutsche welle .
" the mere fact that it pays 8 percent of the budget ensures that .
germany is a constructive voice not only on iran but on issues like peace-building in africa .
it 's a good citizen at the un . "
self-preservation at the heart of opposition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council continues to show a reluctance to change but after facing consistent opposition to individual and collective g-4 membership , germany 's efforts and that of the alliance appeared to have lost momentum in recent years , primarily due to the growing relationship between india and the united states , which has at times diverted new delhi 's focus , and japan 's insistence on evolving a formula that can not be opposed by the us .
washington 's opposition and that of other major powers to the g-4 plan has been a major stumbling block in recent years , while the so-called " coffee club " - an alliance of pakistan , italy , mexico , argentina , south korea and several other countries opposed to the g-4 - has also emerged as a rival to complicate the g-4 's attempts at reform .
" some permanent members of the security council , like china and russia , are suspicious of any reform that would dilute their power there , " said gowan . " within europe , italy is particularly opposed to germany 's ambitions . it fears that if germany won a permanent seat alongside britain and france , its own influence at the un would decline . "
" britain and france both have a strong rhetorical commitment to germany 's cause , " he added . " however , they will do nothing that compromises their own positions on the council . in the past , germany has campaigned for a permanent seat alongside japan , india and brazil . however , it is possible to imagine scenarios in which rapidly rising powers like brazil and india won permanent seats and germany and japan did not . " g-4 allies could be both a help and hindrance to germany with india set to rejuvenate the g-4 ahead of the 65th un general assembly with a series of meetings with alliance ministers aimed at getting the campaign back on-track , germany hopes a new vigor in the group 's collective efforts to reform the council can enhance its own campaign for a permanent seat .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia prefers india and brazil as permanent members " but never underestimate how complex and nasty security council reform negotiations can become , " said gowan .
" the bloc politics are fantastically difficult .
germany also has to be realistic that , while its bid for a permanent seat is taken seriously , it 's actually peripheral to the question of whether india and japan should get such seats . " " the reasons are geopolitical : if india and japan were in the council full-time , it could become a serious center for debate on asian security issues .
it 's not clear whether china wants that .
germany 's presence would probably change the dynamics of the council rather less .
but it 's very hard to imagine a reform process that gave germany a permanent seat but exclude india . that would be political and historical lunacy . " experts unconvinced that german ambitions can be fulfilled a number of experts believe that germany is wasting its time to again lobby for a permanent seat , given the rise to prominence of other states in the geo-political arena , with some saying that the unlikelihood of success or the reform of the council could even persuade chancellor angela merkel to drop the campaign completely . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel at the un : germany may have to accept defeat " it 's very unlikely that germany will try and resurrect their bid for a seat because there really is n't any hope of getting one , " michael emerson , a senior research fellow at the center for european policy studies in brussels , told deutsche welle .
" should the necessary reforms go through , the un will offer seats to the likes of india and brazil over germany , due to its policy of promoting the new powers and because of the over-representation of europe on the council . " " i would be very surprised if this attempt were to be successful , " dr. karen smith at the london school of economics and political science told deutsche welle .
" enlarging the permanent membership of the security council is , i would think , very unlikely to happen . " " the chances of germany getting a permanent seat with a veto comparable to france or britain 's are fairly low , " richard gowan concluded .
" but it could negotiate some sort of semi-permanent seat , one which only requires reelection once every five or 10 years , without a veto .
compromises of this sort have been on the table since the 2005 negotiations on security council reform , and are probably the most realistic option .

from stimulus to growth buoyant demand from abroad and economic stimulus are casting german industry in a positive light by international comparison .
for all the media criticism , german economic policy is better than its reputation , even if a broad growth agenda is still in its infancy .
above and beyond the austerity package already presented , government spending must be scrutinised for its contribution to growth .
tax breaks and subsidies need serious pruning , accompanied by income tax relief in the medium term , with windfall revenues being used to reduce deficits more quickly .
the risks inherent in the social welfare system must be brought under control and latent growth potential in the healthcare system leveraged .
labour policy should continue down the successful path of greater flexibilisation .
a better level of education and sufficient supply of skilled staff would generate consistently more economic momentum .
an integrated energy and climate policy remains an absolutely vital growth driver . our country has innovative minds !
curtain up ...
germany is one of the most knowledge-intensive and innovative countries on earth .
in this study we focus on the innovative performance of its sixteen federal states with reference to eight indicators .
the most innovative states lie in the south , while the east trails in terms of absolute levels .
however , interdisciplinarity and regional industrial diversity cushion negative effects of structural change on the regions and offer alternative sources of sustained economic growth .
looking at the dynamic of innovation it is apparent that the states in the east of germany spearheaded by saxony are on the right course . germany : only modest decline in the current account surplus the german export momentum is currently benefiting from extremely dynamic world trade .
however , it is likely to ease significantly in h2 2010 and above all in 2011 .
in addition to the impact of this cyclical development the highly export-dependent german economy is also being hit by the adjustments in europe ’ s crisis-ridden countries , even though the strain on the german current account is likely to remain within bounds .
nevertheless , in the medium term germany ’ s large current account surplus needs to be reduced , as the origins of the crisis lay in undesirable structural developments on both sides , that is not only in current account deficits , but also in the reciprocal surpluses .
all in all , we expect that the german current account surplus will first widen from 5.0 % to 5 ½ % of gdp this year , before narrowing slowly , however .
in 2012 it could then stand at 4 ½ % . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

its creator , michaela melian , wanted to forge a memorial that would draw the attention of young people and pervade the city . what are memorials , and is it important that they occupy public space ?
certainly they 're a call to remembrance and reflection , but does a " digital memorial " leave out something important by letting people choose when they observe it ?
in munich , an audio map titled memory loops by artist and musician michaela melian has raised questions like these .
the project is a digital memorial to the victims of national socialism in the bavarian capital .
it draws on archival and audio footage relating to the holocaust and can be accessed online in both german and english .
melian 's project arose from a juried competition in munich seeking new forms of remembrance for nazi victims .
the event was meant to address a city monument that had become obscure due to increasing car traffic nearby .
" memory loops analyzes the most varied historical dimensions by focusing on certain crystallization points in the city of munich .
using archival material and contemporary witness statements , melian artistically shapes voice-collages of the highest quality , " noted the jury .
but the idea also had detractors , including munich 's mayor , christian ude .
he reacted to melian 's proposal in 2008 by wondering whether " its means can be used to achieve an appropriate memorial . "
young voices two years later , the project has been opened and is accessible online as of late september 2010 -lrb- see the link to memory loops below -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michaela melian wanted the memory loops project to appeal to young audiences melian drew from newspapers and holocaust archives and conducted interviews personally to accumulate the material for the project .
then she sought out actors - especially children and other young voices - to speak and record the accounts she found .
" i really wanted the files to sound like young people , " explained melian .
" many victims were young when they left the camps or returned from russia . "
the stories reflect their daily struggles and the nazi regime 's gradual expansion of control over their lives .
one victim 's account is tagged to the address sonnenstrasse 116 , just beyond the city center : " once , there was an air raid warning as i was out in town and wearing the star .
i wanted to go down into a shelter nearby , but they did n't let the jew boy in .
the old botanical garden is a stone 's throw away .
i hid under a shrub and cried - bombs were falling left and right . "
atmospheric music the short audio files are linked to a map indicating where each scene actually occurred .
michaela melian composed the music that accompanies many of their statements , taking inspiration from jewish musicians and composers who collided with nazi ideology during that period .
" karl amadeus hartmann was forbidden from working back then , coco schumann was prevented from performing , and mendelssohn-bartholdy could only be performed by jewish musicians for jewish audiences , " said melian .
" those are facets of the story that i wanted to include in the audio files in a subliminal way . "
a city-wide memorial at the memory loops homepage , visitors can click on 175 blue circles in the english version - and 300 in the german edition - to hear the stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project is also available as an audio guide for mobile phones the project is also being supported by broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk and will be presented as a series of radio programs .
some munich museums are lending their support as well by making mp3 players available with which people can tour the city and hear the stories as they go .
a similar version in english can be downloaded and installed on smart phones .
memory loops is , then , a kind of monument that is spread out across the city .
" i wanted to use the media that occupy nearly all of young people 's free time as well as their working lives : the internet and cell phones .
these days , many young people spend more time on the internet than at any social or public places , " melian said .
intimate glimpses into history munich was a center of activity for the nazi party .
that 's why the city is particularly revealing for those who want to understand the forms of persecution to which nazi victims were subjected and what their lives were like .
" in 1935 , we had to leave the apartment and moved to a cheap and dark ground-floor apartment on trogerstrasse -lsb- troger street -rsb- .
it was very close to where hitler lived .
coming home from church once , we saw him in an open mercedes .
my father said to us , ' a little bomb would be just the thing here , " ' recalls one voice in the memory loops project .
it continues , " we lived extremely modestly .
the other boys at school had it pretty good at home - suddenly , their families had jobs and work , and of course their children were all in the hitler youth .
i had to keep quiet about how things were at home with me . "

but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.10.2010 germany 's khedira has gone from backup to bulwark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was germany 's heart and soul against turkey as a defensive stopper , sami khedira does n't post the sort of numbers that leap out at you from score sheets .
but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 12.10.2010 european commission to push member states to do more to help roma großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france has deported thousands of roma to romania this summer starting tuesday , romania is hosting a two-day conference of european nations to discuss how to help integrate roma travelers .
europe 's social affairs commissioner said financial help is available to member states . the european commission will once again push member states to do more to improve the situation for roma travelers on tuesday at a conference in bucharest .
the meeting was organized after the french government began its deportations of roma families over the summer , drawing international criticism .
the bucharest conference aims to promote the better use of eu funds to improve the socio-economic situation of the 10 to 12 million roma living on the continent .
they face discrimination , poverty , segregation , and barriers to education and the labor market in many of the european countries in which they settle .
in slovakia , for example , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education .
in bulgaria , over 50 percent of roma are unemployed .
in romania only about a quarter of roma have a steady job .
european funds are under-used in recent years the european union has brought in a comprehensive financial program to promote the integration of the roma and sinti travelers .
but romania and bulgaria , the eu member states with the biggest roma communities , have made little use of the subsidies .
despite the high-profile debate about integration of roma sparked by france 's crackdown on its traveling community , the european union 's commissioner for social affairs and inclusion complained recently that few nations are drawing on the available financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laszlo andor wants countries to make better use of european funds " i would like to stress that this is the responsibility of the european union and the member states together , " andor said in the european parliament .
" the structural funds offer a very useful financial lever for supporting national efforts to improve the situation of the roma .
however , eu funds are often not fully used , or not used in the most effective way . "
currently romania is only using 1 percent of the 2.25 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- made available by the european social fund between 2007 and 2013 to improve the situation of vulnerable groups .
bulgaria is only using 5 percent of the fund .
integration is not just about money however , there is of course no compulsion to use the money .
the german conservative mep manfred weber hopes there is enough incentive for countries to apply for the money if they need it .
" the decisive factor in integration of course is always that it ca n't be proscribed from above , rather it 's got to happen in the towns , in the communities themselves , " weber told deutsche welle .
" it demands creativity . "
the european commission has set up a working group to assess why the roma struggle so much with integration .
the group will deliver its findings by the end of the year .
in the meantime andor wants member states to set ambitious targets for tackling poverty and improving the educational horizons of the roma .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in slovakia , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education " it 's only about poverty reduction , it 's not only about social inclusion , " the commissioner said .
" we have to ensure that the roma are explicitly mentioned in our new employment flagship initiative , because that 's also where a breakthrough has to be made . "
manfred weber believes governments have to tackle the root of the problem by targeting education .
“ we have to follow through the idea that children of this ethnic minority must attend school .
only then can we succeed in truly integrating these travelling families into european societies . ”
the problems for the roma in europe are not new .
there is money available in europe to tackle it .
but it has taken the row over the policy of deporting roma from france to bring this much-beleaguered community into the spotlight .

but not all germans are happy that their homes , cars and even themselves could be online for all to see . some 1 million germans make use of the street view service daily for a virtual ground 's eye look of the world , according to google .
but the company has been heavily criticized in germany as it gets ready to put maps of german cities online , which the company plans to do by the end of the year .
much of that criticism has come from the southern german state of bavaria , and the region around the city of ingolstadt in particular .
" the problem with google street view is that google - without asking - has gone and photographed german houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used , " georg schaeff , the publisher of the ingolstadt-based daily donaukurier , told deutsche welle .
the newspaper has publicized local opposition to the service for the last two years .
that 's a problem in germany since the country 's highest court has affirmed citizens ' rights to control who has their personal information and how it 's used .
google gives ground " we take privacy very seriously , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service . "
the california tech giant has made concessions to german privacy advocates by allowing material to be made unrecognizable before being published , which it has n't done in the other 23 countries street view is online .
furthermore , after facing widespread criticism , it doubled the opt-out period to eight weeks , which ends on friday .
some 200,000 people have taken google up on the offer to have their homes or apartment building blurred , according to a report in the german news magazine der spiegel .
google , which automatically blurs the faces and vehicle license plates its computer can recognize and asks users to point out the ones it misses , has not commented on the number of opt-out it has received .
bildunterschrift : some 200,000 people have removed themselves from street view , a german magazine reported but schaeff said people have no way of making sure what they see as a violation of their privacy really gets deleted .
he added that citizens have little recourse if google does n't agree with their claim of a privacy infringement by the panoramic photos of whatever is visible from the street taken by the eight cameras mounted on the company 's car .
" individual citizens ca n't assert themselves against these kinds of companies , " he said .
" and the corporations do n't bother to consider if what they are doing is illegal or not .
google works on the premise of ' why ask for permission when you can beg for forgiveness after the fact ? " '
privacy rift but privacy advocates still have a lot of convincing to do .
some 41 percent of germans see more positive than negative aspects to street view and 16 percent say they have or will remove their homes from the service , according to an august study by the emnid research institute .
many ingolstadt locals agreed with the poll 's sentiment .
" google can go ahead and do it , because everyone leaves their tracks all over the internet and everywhere else , " said ingo zingel , an ingolstadt resident .
" whether someone takes a picture of the door to my house really does n't matter . "
schaeff said he 's not surprised that some people do n't seem concerned about what 's happening to their personal information .
" i think there is a rift in society where half the people do n't see a problem and do n't know what 's coming down the road , " he said .
" the other half is much more sensitive and is more careful because the situation is far from clear . "
what 's unclear , he added , is how images from street view - or any other type of geodata , such as that collected by mobile phone providers - can be used to create profiles of individuals that are later sold to third parties .
without knowing how personal data will be used , he said people should give out as little as possible .
" each piece of personal information is like a stone that creates a mosaic , " schaeff said .
" every little stone plays a meaningful role , but , unfortunately , you ca n't tell what the role is until the whole picture has been made . "
' sensible areas ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 41 percent germans said street view has more positive than negative aspects but there are some pictures thomas herker , the mayor of pfaffenhofen , just south of ingolstadt , said he knows he does n't want made .
while he insisted that city hall and pubic offices be visible in street view , he added that some public buildings should be unrecognizable on the internet .
" we requested that google remove public kindergartens and schools , " he said referring to a letter the city sent in december 2009 to google 's german headquarters in hamburg .
" two weeks ago we were told they would not do it because only private individuals - not municipalities - have a right to remove property . "
herker led a group of bavarian mayors which sent another request to google asking for the company to respect their wishes and remove kindergartens and other " sensible areas " from street view .
while herker is left hoping google accounts for his city 's wishes , the point may become moot if the service goes online as planned by the end of the year .
the last time herker wrote to google it took 10 months to get a form letter response .
if it takes that long again the pictures will have long been online for all to see .
" there are three companies in germany that , in my opinion , are problematic : deutsche telekom , deutsche bahn , and now i 've added google to the list , " he said .
" i can only hope that google will change its mind and make it possible to remove public property from the service . "

but not all germans are happy that their homes , cars and even themselves could be online for all to see . some 1 million germans make use of the street view service daily for a virtual ground 's eye look of the world , according to google .
but the company has been heavily criticized in germany as it gets ready to put maps of german cities online , which the company plans to do by the end of the year .
much of that criticism has come from the southern german state of bavaria , and the region around the city of ingolstadt in particular .
" the problem with google street view is that google - without asking - has gone and photographed german houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used , " georg schaeff , the publisher of the ingolstadt-based daily donaukurier , told deutsche welle .
the newspaper has publicized local opposition to the service for the last two years .
that 's a problem in germany since the country 's highest court has affirmed citizens ' rights to control who has their personal information and how it 's used .
google gives ground " we take privacy very seriously , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service . "
the california tech giant has made concessions to german privacy advocates by allowing material to be made unrecognizable before being published , which it has n't done in the other 23 countries street view is online .
furthermore , after facing widespread criticism , it doubled the opt-out period to eight weeks , which ends on friday .
some 200,000 people have taken google up on the offer to have their homes or apartment building blurred , according to a report in the german news magazine der spiegel .
google , which automatically blurs the faces and vehicle license plates its computer can recognize and asks users to point out the ones it misses , has not commented on the number of opt-out it has received .
bildunterschrift : some 200,000 people have removed themselves from street view , a german magazine reported but schaeff said people have no way of making sure what they see as a violation of their privacy really gets deleted .
he added that citizens have little recourse if google does n't agree with their claim of a privacy infringement by the panoramic photos of whatever is visible from the street taken by the eight cameras mounted on the company 's car .
" individual citizens ca n't assert themselves against these kinds of companies , " he said .
" and the corporations do n't bother to consider if what they are doing is illegal or not .
google works on the premise of ' why ask for permission when you can beg for forgiveness after the fact ? " '
privacy rift but privacy advocates still have a lot of convincing to do .
some 41 percent of germans see more positive than negative aspects to street view and 16 percent say they have or will remove their homes from the service , according to an august study by the emnid research institute .
many ingolstadt locals agreed with the poll 's sentiment .
" google can go ahead and do it , because everyone leaves their tracks all over the internet and everywhere else , " said ingo zingel , an ingolstadt resident .
" whether someone takes a picture of the door to my house really does n't matter . "
schaeff said he 's not surprised that some people do n't seem concerned about what 's happening to their personal information .
" i think there is a rift in society where half the people do n't see a problem and do n't know what 's coming down the road , " he said .
" the other half is much more sensitive and is more careful because the situation is far from clear . "
what 's unclear , he added , is how images from street view - or any other type of geodata , such as that collected by mobile phone providers - can be used to create profiles of individuals that are later sold to third parties .

but not all germans are happy that their homes , cars and even themselves could be online for all to see . some 1 million germans make use of the street view service daily for a virtual ground 's eye look of the world , according to google .
but the company has been heavily criticized in germany as it gets ready to put maps of german cities online , which the company plans to do by the end of the year .
much of that criticism has come from the southern german state of bavaria , and the region around the city of ingolstadt in particular .
" the problem with google street view is that google - without asking - has gone and photographed german houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used , " georg schaeff , the publisher of the ingolstadt-based daily donaukurier , told deutsche welle .
the newspaper has publicized local opposition to the service for the last two years .
that 's a problem in germany since the country 's highest court has affirmed citizens ' rights to control who has their personal information and how it 's used .
google gives ground " we take privacy very seriously , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service . "
the california tech giant has made concessions to german privacy advocates by allowing material to be made unrecognizable before being published , which it has n't done in the other 23 countries street view is online .
furthermore , after facing widespread criticism , it doubled the opt-out period to eight weeks , which ends on friday .
some 200,000 people have taken google up on the offer to have their homes or apartment building blurred , according to a report in the german news magazine der spiegel .
google , which automatically blurs the faces and vehicle license plates its computer can recognize and asks users to point out the ones it misses , has not commented on the number of opt-out it has received .
bildunterschrift : some 200,000 people have removed themselves from street view , a german magazine reported but schaeff said people have no way of making sure what they see as a violation of their privacy really gets deleted .
he added that citizens have little recourse if google does n't agree with their claim of a privacy infringement by the panoramic photos of whatever is visible from the street taken by the eight cameras mounted on the company 's car .
" individual citizens ca n't assert themselves against these kinds of companies , " he said .
" and the corporations do n't bother to consider if what they are doing is illegal or not .
google works on the premise of ' why ask for permission when you can beg for forgiveness after the fact ? " '
privacy rift but privacy advocates still have a lot of convincing to do .
some 41 percent of germans see more positive than negative aspects to street view and 16 percent say they have or will remove their homes from the service , according to an august study by the emnid research institute .
many ingolstadt locals agreed with the poll 's sentiment .
" google can go ahead and do it , because everyone leaves their tracks all over the internet and everywhere else , " said ingo zingel , an ingolstadt resident .
" whether someone takes a picture of the door to my house really does n't matter . "
schaeff said he 's not surprised that some people do n't seem concerned about what 's happening to their personal information .
" i think there is a rift in society where half the people do n't see a problem and do n't know what 's coming down the road , " he said .
" the other half is much more sensitive and is more careful because the situation is far from clear . "
what 's unclear , he added , is how images from street view - or any other type of geodata , such as that collected by mobile phone providers - can be used to create profiles of individuals that are later sold to third parties .
without knowing how personal data will be used , he said people should give out as little as possible .
" each piece of personal information is like a stone that creates a mosaic , " schaeff said .
" every little stone plays a meaningful role , but , unfortunately , you ca n't tell what the role is until the whole picture has been made . "
' sensible areas ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 41 percent germans said street view has more positive than negative aspects but there are some pictures thomas herker , the mayor of pfaffenhofen , just south of ingolstadt , said he knows he does n't want made .
while he insisted that city hall and pubic offices be visible in street view , he added that some public buildings should be unrecognizable on the internet .
" we requested that google remove public kindergartens and schools , " he said referring to a letter the city sent in december 2009 to google 's german headquarters in hamburg .
" two weeks ago we were told they would not do it because only private individuals - not municipalities - have a right to remove property . "
herker led a group of bavarian mayors which sent another request to google asking for the company to respect their wishes and remove kindergartens and other " sensible areas " from street view .
while herker is left hoping google accounts for his city 's wishes , the point may become moot if the service goes online as planned by the end of the year .
the last time herker wrote to google it took 10 months to get a form letter response .
if it takes that long again the pictures will have long been online for all to see .
" there are three companies in germany that , in my opinion , are problematic : deutsche telekom , deutsche bahn , and now i 've added google to the list , " he said .
" i can only hope that google will change its mind and make it possible to remove public property from the service . "

however , one city in the southern state of bavaria , oberstaufen , has publicly supported google street view - and may be the only city in the country that has supported the company to such a great degree .
in an interview with deutsche welle , bianca keybach , the head of oberstaufen 's tourist office , explained why the city even went so far as to bake for google .
deutsche welle : oberstaufen made a video and even baked a cake for google .
is that right ? bianca keybach : yes , we made a cake for google to welcome them and we put it into our facebook fan page and afterward we sent an invitation to google to say that we would be glad to welcome them here , and then google contacted us and we will see what happens .
when google contacted you , what happened ?
they were thankful for being so positive because this was a very big discussion in germany , -lsb- due to privacy -rsb- and taking pictures and everybody says we do n't want that .
we were one of the towns that said we would like -lsb- street view -rsb- .
tell me why you want google taking street view photographs in your town ?
what do you hope to accomplish other than to show how great the town is ?
i think that it would be an additional service for our guests .
when they are choosing a hotel or reading our brochures or they look at our homepage and they ca n't really say if everything is true , if there is a big street next to the hotel .
with google street view they can look into the town and discover the street , discover the region and after the holidays they can show their family and friends where they have been and what they can recommend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bianca keybach is the head of oberstaufen 's tourism office google has sent out their street view vehicles to big cities around germany , and they 're going to be releasing the photos for the 20 biggest cities around germany later this year .
have they actually sent a car to oberstaufen ?
they 've been here last year or at the beginning of this year .
they were in oberstaufen .
nobody saw them , though .
they took pictures and they have them and we 'll all waiting if there 's any chance that we can go on street view as soon as possible .
some have argued against street view because they say criminals could use it to plan robberies .
do you think that 's a valid argument ?
that 's a very interesting argument , because it 's one of the most important arguments for the critics but i think it 's crazy because the pictures were taken five or 10 months ago and they will be online for five or 10 years .
but if i want to get into a house and commit a crime , i wo n't use a picture that is many years old .
i could just use a postcard , for example , as a basis for burglary .
i think that 's not very realistic , but it 's very nice for a symbolic discussion .
are you surprised that there have n't been more cities that have welcomed google like oberstaufen has ?
i was not surprised because usually in germany you wait -lsb- to not draw attention to yourself -rsb- .
as long as you 're waiting , nobody is criticizing you .
i think it 's german , and it 's normal that no other towns really said , " we like google and we welcome google and we see a lot of positive aspects in this theme . "
after we said we like google and we support google street view , in our region , other towns and villages said , " we like would like to have them here , but you have to be the pioneer . "
we are glad that we decided to be very open .
now you mentioned earlier that you sent google a cake .
what kind of cake was it ?
i think it was a chocolate cake that was covered in frosting .
we just took a picture of the cake and sent the picture by e-mail , by twitter and we put it on facebook and we sent a real invitation that as soon as they come to take the other pictures of oberstaufen we will welcome them with the original cake .

however , one city in the southern state of bavaria , oberstaufen , has publicly supported google street view - and may be the only city in the country that has supported the company to such a great degree .
in an interview with deutsche welle , bianca keybach , the head of oberstaufen 's tourist office , explained why the city even went so far as to bake for google .
deutsche welle : oberstaufen made a video and even baked a cake for google .
is that right ? bianca keybach : yes , we made a cake for google to welcome them and we put it into our facebook fan page and afterward we sent an invitation to google to say that we would be glad to welcome them here , and then google contacted us and we will see what happens .
when google contacted you , what happened ?
they were thankful for being so positive because this was a very big discussion in germany , -lsb- due to privacy -rsb- and taking pictures and everybody says we do n't want that .
we were one of the towns that said we would like -lsb- street view -rsb- .
tell me why you want google taking street view photographs in your town ?
what do you hope to accomplish other than to show how great the town is ?
i think that it would be an additional service for our guests .
when they are choosing a hotel or reading our brochures or they look at our homepage and they ca n't really say if everything is true , if there is a big street next to the hotel .
with google street view they can look into the town and discover the street , discover the region and after the holidays they can show their family and friends where they have been and what they can recommend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bianca keybach is the head of oberstaufen 's tourism office google has sent out their street view vehicles to big cities around germany , and they 're going to be releasing the photos for the 20 biggest cities around germany later this year .
have they actually sent a car to oberstaufen ?
they 've been here last year or at the beginning of this year .
they were in oberstaufen .
nobody saw them , though .
they took pictures and they have them and we 'll all waiting if there 's any chance that we can go on street view as soon as possible .
some have argued against street view because they say criminals could use it to plan robberies .
do you think that 's a valid argument ?
that 's a very interesting argument , because it 's one of the most important arguments for the critics but i think it 's crazy because the pictures were taken five or 10 months ago and they will be online for five or 10 years .
but if i want to get into a house and commit a crime , i wo n't use a picture that is many years old .
i could just use a postcard , for example , as a basis for burglary .
i think that 's not very realistic , but it 's very nice for a symbolic discussion .
are you surprised that there have n't been more cities that have welcomed google like oberstaufen has ?
i was not surprised because usually in germany you wait -lsb- to not draw attention to yourself -rsb- .
as long as you 're waiting , nobody is criticizing you .
i think it 's german , and it 's normal that no other towns really said , " we like google and we welcome google and we see a lot of positive aspects in this theme . "
after we said we like google and we support google street view , in our region , other towns and villages said , " we like would like to have them here , but you have to be the pioneer . "
we are glad that we decided to be very open .
now you mentioned earlier that you sent google a cake .
what kind of cake was it ?
i think it was a chocolate cake that was covered in frosting .
we just took a picture of the cake and sent the picture by e-mail , by twitter and we put it on facebook and we sent a real invitation that as soon as they come to take the other pictures of oberstaufen we will welcome them with the original cake .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 12.10.2010 eu searches for answers in roma integration debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some roma have been deported back to romania from france integrating roma in european countries has proven to be difficult , but experts at an eu conference are trying to find solutions .
the two-day conference is being held in the romanian capital , bucharest . european union officials , romanian politicians and roma representatives are discussing integration issues regarding europe 's roma population at a two-day eu conference held in romania 's capital , bucharest .
the conference is aimed at finding solutions on how to achieve more with the money spent by the european union on integrating roma , said the european commissioner for employment and social affairs , laszlo andor , at the opening of the conference .
" a lot has been done in terms of strategic planning , coordination and implementation , but at the end of the day , not much has really changed . " he said .
andor wants eu member states to become more engaged in integrating their roma population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " not much has really changed " - andor said at the conference " the eu can not solve the multi-layered problems of the roma by itself , " he said .
" the european union is ready to step up its efforts for roma integration , but that is also what we expect from all member states . "
funding is available , yet few members take the money even though the european union has funds available , member states refrain from using the money .
from 2007 until 2013 , the european social fund offered 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.1 billion -rrb- to help finance education and housing projects for roma .
especially countries with a high number of roma population like hungary , bulgaria and romania were expected make use of the funds .
the eu has installed a task force in order to find out why member states do not act even though the funds are available .
the task force is expected to present its results by the end of this year .
hungarian prime minister viktor orban said that the integration of roma would be one of the main focuses in hungary 's term in the eu presidency beginning in january .
according to andor , france 's drastic measures of expelling thousands of roma were " very unfortunate " , but " ironically energized the discussions on roma inclusion . "
problem of roma integration will not affect schengen talks german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting romanian prime minister emil boc that the problem of roma integration would not affect negotiations on romania becoming part of the schengen zone .
being a country within the schengen treaty would give romanian citizen visa-free travel within the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a long way from the end of the road , " - according to chancellor merkel merkel said that germany would judge romania 's development on their way to the schengen treaty fairly - but did not promise a quick entrance to the schengen zone .
" the reforms of the judiciary and of interior affairs are being tackled very courageously , but you are still a long way from the end of the road , " merkel said . " we back romania 's efforts to join the schengen zone ... but we must make sure that visa delivery procedures are not marred by corruption , " she said .
it is crucial that romania only issue visas without signs of corruption or unregularities and that eu 's external borders are safe .
" there are no reasonable alternatives to transparent and clear legal terms . " romania is hoping to enter the schengen zone in the middle of 2011 .
the country has been a member of the eu since 2007 .
most of europe 's roma are said to live in romania , but there are no reliable numbers - with figures ranging from a population of 530,000 up to 2.5 million .

the two-day conference is being held in the romanian capital , bucharest . european union officials , romanian politicians and roma representatives are discussing integration issues regarding europe 's roma population at a two-day eu conference held in romania 's capital , bucharest .
the conference is aimed at finding solutions on how to achieve more with the money spent by the european union on integrating roma , said the european commissioner for employment and social affairs , laszlo andor , at the opening of the conference .
" a lot has been done in terms of strategic planning , coordination and implementation , but at the end of the day , not much has really changed . " he said .
andor wants eu member states to become more engaged in integrating their roma population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " not much has really changed " - andor said at the conference " the eu can not solve the multi-layered problems of the roma by itself , " he said .
" the european union is ready to step up its efforts for roma integration , but that is also what we expect from all member states . "
funding is available , yet few members take the money even though the european union has funds available , member states refrain from using the money .
from 2007 until 2013 , the european social fund offered 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.1 billion -rrb- to help finance education and housing projects for roma .
especially countries with a high number of roma population like hungary , bulgaria and romania were expected make use of the funds .
the eu has installed a task force in order to find out why member states do not act even though the funds are available .
the task force is expected to present its results by the end of this year .
hungarian prime minister viktor orban said that the integration of roma would be one of the main focuses in hungary 's term in the eu presidency beginning in january .
according to andor , france 's drastic measures of expelling thousands of roma were " very unfortunate " , but " ironically energized the discussions on roma inclusion . "
problem of roma integration will not affect schengen talks german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting romanian prime minister emil boc that the problem of roma integration would not affect negotiations on romania becoming part of the schengen zone .
being a country within the schengen treaty would give romanian citizen visa-free travel within the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a long way from the end of the road , " - according to chancellor merkel merkel said that germany would judge romania 's development on their way to the schengen treaty fairly - but did not promise a quick entrance to the schengen zone .
" the reforms of the judiciary and of interior affairs are being tackled very courageously , but you are still a long way from the end of the road , " merkel said . " we back romania 's efforts to join the schengen zone ... but we must make sure that visa delivery procedures are not marred by corruption , " she said .
it is crucial that romania only issue visas without signs of corruption or unregularities and that eu 's external borders are safe .
" there are no reasonable alternatives to transparent and clear legal terms . " romania is hoping to enter the schengen zone in the middle of 2011 .
the country has been a member of the eu since 2007 .
most of europe 's roma are said to live in romania , but there are no reliable numbers - with figures ranging from a population of 530,000 up to 2.5 million .

" learn german !
adjust to the customs of your host country , " he told daily newspaper bild in an interview published on tuesday .
" you do n't have to give up the gift of your identity and culture , but rather think of yourselves as ambassadors for turkey .
only then can you build bridges for a better friendship and partnership between our countries . "
three days before his comments were published , german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan met in berlin on the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between the two countries , pledging to cooperate more on integration of turks living in germany .
multi-faceted integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to work together on integration ines michalowski , a senior researcher at berlin 's social science research center , said the call for turkish-germans to maintain their culture while still adjusting to german customs may seem paradoxical , but that the two are not mutually exclusive .
" the turkish nation-state is a very nationalistic nation , where there are actually claims of turks belonging to the turkish nation-state even though they have been living abroad for several generations , " she told deutsche welle .
" but that does n't mean that integration on the labor market , or in the educational system , or contacts with germans - that these aspects of integration go badly . "
still , research shows that most turkish germans are poorly integrated in these areas - a fact which haci halil uslucan , director of the center for turkish studies and integration research , said can not be entirely attributed to a perceived lack of motivation of immigrants to integrate themselves .
" i think we also have to focus on the conditions of being integrated - and that means the attitudes of the majority , the look of the majority on the minority , " he told deutsche welle .
" the political discussion should not go in this direction of creating ranks - these are the good immigrants and these are the bad ones .
that only increases social tension . "
education is key bagis also said in his interview that turkish-german parents should send their children " to the best schools , so that they have a future , " echoing comments by prime minister erdogan that turkish-germans should prioritize education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research shows other minorities have integrated better than turks michalowski said studies of vietnamese immigrant parents in the eastern state of brandenburg have shown their children to have higher high-school graduation and college entrance rates than non-immigrant german children , partly because the parents place a high priority on education .
" some of the criticism has been that maybe turkish parents are not putting enough emphasis on getting a good education within germany , " she said .
" so if there is a government official from turkey who actually encourages people to pay more attention to the education of their children , i think that can never do any harm . "
but uslucan said other research shows that turkish-german parents have high educational aspirations for their children , and that teachers often send young turkish students to lower-level high schools that do not feed into universities , even when their educational performance is as good as their non-turkish peers .
" the doctrine must be that turkish parents should have more information about the german educational system , " he said .
" i think there is the problem that turkish parents do n't have enough information on what the best school is . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has made entry into the eu a high priority ambassadors for turkish eu accession in addition to his post as eu affairs minister , bagis is also chiefly responsible for negotiating turkey 's accession into the bloc .
while merkel has called turkey 's accession process " open-ended with no guarantees , " the turkish government has made it a high priority .
michalowski said bagis 's call on immigrants to integrate could be seen as a way of enhancing turkey 's chances of gaining eu membership .
" if you have a well-integrated minority , people in germany may be more favorable to the idea of turkey becoming a member of the european union than if the turkish community is always in the media as being badly integrated , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 12.10.2010 asia faces a worsening water crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most rivers in bali are heavily polluted if present trends continue , the gap between demand and supply will be as high as 40 percent by 2030 , the asian development bank has warned in a new report .
inefficient water use and pollution are among the major factors . while tourists are enjoying their vacation on the white beaches and at the well-maintained hotel pools , bali 's children are playing near polluted , stinking rivers .
there is hardly any sewage treatment in indonesia .
waste water from industry , agriculture and private homes mostly pours into the nearest stream or river , without any filtering .
health problems according to estimates by the world health organization , about 50,000 people die from illnesses related to polluted water in indonesia every year .
and there are approximately 120 million cases of diarrhoea , skin diseases and other illnesses caused by contaminated water annually .
yuyun ismawati , the director of the environmental group balifokus , says : " in some areas , people are getting used to using bad water , so they kind of build up their immune system and do not get sick very easily .
but in some areas , especially for visitors and tourists , it affects their stomach and they get diarrhoea and so on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yuyun ismawati receives the goldman environmental prize waterborne diseases not only affect people ’ s health , but also have an economic fallout .
this begins at the family level , yuyun ismawati emphasizes . " children are especially affected .
and in many cases when children get diarrhoea , that also affects their parents because they can not go to work .
and most of them rely on daily wages , so they will lose their income on that day .
or if the children who suffer from diarrhoea are of school age , they lose one day 's opportunity to go to school . "
tourists use more water in bali , the group maintains , the existing water resources are only enough to support a population of 2.7 million people .
by now , the island ’ s population has grown to 3.5 million .
and that does not include the more than 4 million tourists that visit bali every year .
most of them have no idea how much water they use every day .
" not very much .
i imagine it wouldn ’ t be more than 40 liters , " says one man .
" showers are very quick - 20 to 40 liters . "
another tourist guesses wildly : " about 10 liters : take a shower , drinking – oh , no , maybe it is up to 100 liters . "
bildunterschrift : hotels in bali use 500 liters of water per day and room in fact , it is 500 liters per day and hotel room in bali ’ s tourist areas , says the ngo balifokus , which specializes in water issues and wastewater management .
the figure for tourists is much higher than for the general population , taking into account not only the water for the showers , but also for the swimming pool and the watering of the hotel garden .
paradise lost yuyun ismawati from balifokus sees trouble ahead for the fabled ' island of the gods ' : " i think in the next 20 years , we might not be recognized as a paradise island any more because paradise should not be congested , paradise should not be stinky . "
in order to save the island , balifokus is currently developing projects for sewage treatment in cooperation with the bremen overseas research and development association , or borda , from the german city of bremen .

"
he is hoping his visit will help promote “ sensible arrangements . ”
but observers are skeptical . economics minister rainer bruederle has framed his two-day trip to china , which began in beijing on tuesday , as a pacifying mission , following recent acrimony between china and many g-20 countries over trade .
" the danger of a trade war has appeared on the horizon , " bruederle told reporters traveling with him on his two-day trip to china , which is to include stops in beijing and shanghai .
the minister warned that accusations of currency manipulation should not be allowed to escalate , and protectionism must be avoided .
some of china 's trading partners in the us and europe have recently accused beijing of allowing the yuan to depreciate at a faster pace .
critics say the unit could be undervalued by as much as 40 percent .
ambassador and missionary speaking in beijing , bruederle refuted these claims , pointing out that the yuan had increased in value by 15 to 17 percent in the past two years , and he added that he did not expect the chinese government to adopt flexible trading patterns in the future .
" we must not allow the situation to get out of hand , or turn our backs on free trade , " bruederle said , adding that he saw himself as an " ambassador , perhaps even a missionary , for the fight against protectionism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has faced pressure from the eu over currency depreciation bruederle expressed satisfaction with the state of german-chinese trade , which has grown significantly this year .
german exports to china have grown by 52 percent to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of this year , while chinese exports have risen by 34 percent , compared to 2009 figures .
germany is considered one of china 's best friends in the west .
" the germans have been pushing for an open trade policy towards china , " jonathan holslag of the brussels institute of contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" germany 's economic revival after the financial crisis has been - to a large degree - made in china . "
" most of the expansion in germany 's exports – particularly cars and machinery – has been bound for china , " says holslag .
for this reason , holslag believes , the german government has often cautioned against protectionism towards china .
" angela merkel has also openly expressed her support for granting china market economy status , " holslag points out .
" this would make it more difficult for the european commission to apply anti-dumping procedures . "
good on the small-scale , not so much on the large-scale but despite germany 's huge economic interest in china – not only through exports , but also through direct investment from individual companies – bruederle 's leverage during this trip is likely to be limited .
the minister said that one of his main aims for the trip was to ensure that medium-sized german businesses gained better opportunities in china .
after his meetings with chinese commerce minister chen deming and zhang ping , the head of the country 's top economic planning agency , bruederle said he had been assured that german companies could take part in open competition in china provided they used a minimum of 50 percent local products .
but holslag believes this is a secondary priority for bruederle compared to maintaining export agreements .
" it 's important to distinguish degrees of urgency , " he says .
" the most important objective for the german government is to step up exports , and the second level is access to the chinese market .
germany is likely to be very cautious in negotiations , in order to protect exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery has been largely based on exports to china but despite this , there is concern that german companies are being disadvantaged by the chinese government .
rolf langhammer , vice-president of the kiel institute for the world economy , believes that this is where bruederle can at least make sure german businesses can get their voices heard .
" germany enjoys a very good position in china compared to other european countries , but of course there are barriers to mid-sized german companies , " he told deutsche welle .
" a lot of representatives of these firms are accompanying bruederle . "
langhammer does not think that bruederle can apply much pressure on the question of global exchange rates – the issue he addressed on arrival .
" the chinese government has always made clear that it wo n't let itself be influenced on this subject , and bruederle 's visit wo n't change anything in the discussion about the exchange rate . "
langhammer is also unconvinced by bruederle 's attempt to position himself as a mediator between the china and the west .
" that 's a role he can not play , " he says .
" he is much too small for that .
he does n't speak for the eurozone , he speaks for an export country called germany .
of course he can represent the interests of mid-sized companies , and he can voice their concerns if they feel themselves disadvantaged alongside chinese competition , but he ca n't solve the big questions – and he ca n't be a mediator in them . "

german exports to china have grown by 52 percent to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of this year , while chinese exports have risen by 34 percent , compared to 2009 figures .
germany is considered one of china 's best friends in the west .
" the germans have been pushing for an open trade policy towards china , " jonathan holslag of the brussels institute of contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" germany 's economic revival after the financial crisis has been - to a large degree - made in china . "
" most of the expansion in germany 's exports – particularly cars and machinery – has been bound for china , " says holslag .
for this reason , holslag believes , the german government has often cautioned against protectionism towards china .
" angela merkel has also openly expressed her support for granting china market economy status , " holslag points out .
" this would make it more difficult for the european commission to apply anti-dumping procedures . "
good on the small-scale , not so much on the large-scale but despite germany 's huge economic interest in china – not only through exports , but also through direct investment from individual companies – bruederle 's leverage during this trip is likely to be limited .
the minister said that one of his main aims for the trip was to ensure that medium-sized german businesses gained better opportunities in china .
after his meetings with chinese commerce minister chen deming and zhang ping , the head of the country 's top economic planning agency , bruederle said he had been assured that german companies could take part in open competition in china provided they used a minimum of 50 percent local products .
but holslag believes this is a secondary priority for bruederle compared to maintaining export agreements .
" it 's important to distinguish degrees of urgency , " he says .
" the most important objective for the german government is to step up exports , and the second level is access to the chinese market .
germany is likely to be very cautious in negotiations , in order to protect exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery has been largely based on exports to china but despite this , there is concern that german companies are being disadvantaged by the chinese government .
rolf langhammer , vice-president of the kiel institute for the world economy , believes that this is where bruederle can at least make sure german businesses can get their voices heard .
" germany enjoys a very good position in china compared to other european countries , but of course there are barriers to mid-sized german companies , " he told deutsche welle .
" a lot of representatives of these firms are accompanying bruederle . "
langhammer does not think that bruederle can apply much pressure on the question of global exchange rates – the issue he addressed on arrival .
" the chinese government has always made clear that it wo n't let itself be influenced on this subject , and bruederle 's visit wo n't change anything in the discussion about the exchange rate . "
langhammer is also unconvinced by bruederle 's attempt to position himself as a mediator between the china and the west .
" that 's a role he can not play , " he says .
" he is much too small for that .
he does n't speak for the eurozone , he speaks for an export country called germany .
of course he can represent the interests of mid-sized companies , and he can voice their concerns if they feel themselves disadvantaged alongside chinese competition , but he ca n't solve the big questions – and he ca n't be a mediator in them . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 12.10.2010 digital memorial to nazi victims combines technology , history and artistry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english version of memory loops contains 175 sites munich has opened a new digital monument to the victims of national socialism .
its creator , michaela melian , wanted to forge a memorial that would draw the attention of young people and pervade the city . what are memorials , and is it important that they occupy public space ?
certainly they 're a call to remembrance and reflection , but does a " digital memorial " leave out something important by letting people choose when they observe it ?
in munich , an audio map titled memory loops by artist and musician michaela melian has raised questions like these .
the project is a digital memorial to the victims of national socialism in the bavarian capital .
it draws on archival and audio footage relating to the holocaust and can be accessed online in both german and english .
melian 's project arose from a juried competition in munich seeking new forms of remembrance for nazi victims .
the event was meant to address a city monument that had become obscure due to increasing car traffic nearby .
" memory loops analyzes the most varied historical dimensions by focusing on certain crystallization points in the city of munich .
using archival material and contemporary witness statements , melian artistically shapes voice-collages of the highest quality , " noted the jury .
but the idea also had detractors , including munich 's mayor , christian ude .
he reacted to melian 's proposal in 2008 by wondering whether " its means can be used to achieve an appropriate memorial . "
young voices two years later , the project has been opened and is accessible online as of late september 2010 -lrb- see the link to memory loops below -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michaela melian wanted the memory loops project to appeal to young audiences melian drew from newspapers and holocaust archives and conducted interviews personally to accumulate the material for the project .
then she sought out actors - especially children and other young voices - to speak and record the accounts she found .
" i really wanted the files to sound like young people , " explained melian .
" many victims were young when they left the camps or returned from russia . "
the stories reflect their daily struggles and the nazi regime 's gradual expansion of control over their lives .
one victim 's account is tagged to the address sonnenstrasse 116 , just beyond the city center : " once , there was an air raid warning as i was out in town and wearing the star .
i wanted to go down into a shelter nearby , but they did n't let the jew boy in .
the old botanical garden is a stone 's throw away .
i hid under a shrub and cried - bombs were falling left and right . "
atmospheric music the short audio files are linked to a map indicating where each scene actually occurred .
michaela melian composed the music that accompanies many of their statements , taking inspiration from jewish musicians and composers who collided with nazi ideology during that period .
" karl amadeus hartmann was forbidden from working back then , coco schumann was prevented from performing , and mendelssohn-bartholdy could only be performed by jewish musicians for jewish audiences , " said melian .
" those are facets of the story that i wanted to include in the audio files in a subliminal way . "
a city-wide memorial at the memory loops homepage , visitors can click on 175 blue circles in the english version - and 300 in the german edition - to hear the stories .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project is also available as an audio guide for mobile phones the project is also being supported by broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk and will be presented as a series of radio programs .
some munich museums are lending their support as well by making mp3 players available with which people can tour the city and hear the stories as they go .
a similar version in english can be downloaded and installed on smart phones .
memory loops is , then , a kind of monument that is spread out across the city .
" i wanted to use the media that occupy nearly all of young people 's free time as well as their working lives : the internet and cell phones .
these days , many young people spend more time on the internet than at any social or public places , " melian said .
intimate glimpses into history munich was a center of activity for the nazi party .
that 's why the city is particularly revealing for those who want to understand the forms of persecution to which nazi victims were subjected and what their lives were like .
" in 1935 , we had to leave the apartment and moved to a cheap and dark ground-floor apartment on trogerstrasse -lsb- troger street -rsb- .
it was very close to where hitler lived .
coming home from church once , we saw him in an open mercedes .
my father said to us , ' a little bomb would be just the thing here , " ' recalls one voice in the memory loops project .
it continues , " we lived extremely modestly .
the other boys at school had it pretty good at home - suddenly , their families had jobs and work , and of course their children were all in the hitler youth .
i had to keep quiet about how things were at home with me . "

its creator , michaela melian , wanted to forge a memorial that would draw the attention of young people and pervade the city . what are memorials , and is it important that they occupy public space ?
certainly they 're a call to remembrance and reflection , but does a " digital memorial " leave out something important by letting people choose when they observe it ?
in munich , an audio map titled memory loops by artist and musician michaela melian has raised questions like these .
the project is a digital memorial to the victims of national socialism in the bavarian capital .
it draws on archival and audio footage relating to the holocaust and can be accessed online in both german and english .
melian 's project arose from a juried competition in munich seeking new forms of remembrance for nazi victims .
the event was meant to address a city monument that had become obscure due to increasing car traffic nearby .
" memory loops analyzes the most varied historical dimensions by focusing on certain crystallization points in the city of munich .
using archival material and contemporary witness statements , melian artistically shapes voice-collages of the highest quality , " noted the jury .
but the idea also had detractors , including munich 's mayor , christian ude .
he reacted to melian 's proposal in 2008 by wondering whether " its means can be used to achieve an appropriate memorial . "
young voices two years later , the project has been opened and is accessible online as of late september 2010 -lrb- see the link to memory loops below -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michaela melian wanted the memory loops project to appeal to young audiences melian drew from newspapers and holocaust archives and conducted interviews personally to accumulate the material for the project .
then she sought out actors - especially children and other young voices - to speak and record the accounts she found .
" i really wanted the files to sound like young people , " explained melian .
" many victims were young when they left the camps or returned from russia . "
the stories reflect their daily struggles and the nazi regime 's gradual expansion of control over their lives .
one victim 's account is tagged to the address sonnenstrasse 116 , just beyond the city center : " once , there was an air raid warning as i was out in town and wearing the star .

inefficient water use and pollution are among the major factors . while tourists are enjoying their vacation on the white beaches and at the well-maintained hotel pools , bali 's children are playing near polluted , stinking rivers .
there is hardly any sewage treatment in indonesia .
waste water from industry , agriculture and private homes mostly pours into the nearest stream or river , without any filtering .
health problems according to estimates by the world health organization , about 50,000 people die from illnesses related to polluted water in indonesia every year .
and there are approximately 120 million cases of diarrhoea , skin diseases and other illnesses caused by contaminated water annually .
yuyun ismawati , the director of the environmental group balifokus , says : " in some areas , people are getting used to using bad water , so they kind of build up their immune system and do not get sick very easily .
but in some areas , especially for visitors and tourists , it affects their stomach and they get diarrhoea and so on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yuyun ismawati receives the goldman environmental prize waterborne diseases not only affect people ’ s health , but also have an economic fallout .
this begins at the family level , yuyun ismawati emphasizes . " children are especially affected .
and in many cases when children get diarrhoea , that also affects their parents because they can not go to work .
and most of them rely on daily wages , so they will lose their income on that day .
or if the children who suffer from diarrhoea are of school age , they lose one day 's opportunity to go to school . "
tourists use more water in bali , the group maintains , the existing water resources are only enough to support a population of 2.7 million people .
by now , the island ’ s population has grown to 3.5 million .
and that does not include the more than 4 million tourists that visit bali every year .
most of them have no idea how much water they use every day .
" not very much .
i imagine it wouldn ’ t be more than 40 liters , " says one man .
" showers are very quick - 20 to 40 liters . "
another tourist guesses wildly : " about 10 liters : take a shower , drinking – oh , no , maybe it is up to 100 liters . "
bildunterschrift : hotels in bali use 500 liters of water per day and room in fact , it is 500 liters per day and hotel room in bali ’ s tourist areas , says the ngo balifokus , which specializes in water issues and wastewater management .
the figure for tourists is much higher than for the general population , taking into account not only the water for the showers , but also for the swimming pool and the watering of the hotel garden .
paradise lost yuyun ismawati from balifokus sees trouble ahead for the fabled ' island of the gods ' : " i think in the next 20 years , we might not be recognized as a paradise island any more because paradise should not be congested , paradise should not be stinky . "
in order to save the island , balifokus is currently developing projects for sewage treatment in cooperation with the bremen overseas research and development association , or borda , from the german city of bremen .
in 2009 , balifokus ' director yuyun ismawati was awarded the goldman environmental prize for grassroots environmental action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 12.10.2010 german economics minister warns of ' trade war ' with china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle arrived in china on tuesday economics minister rainer bruederle began his two-day trip to china with warnings of a " trade war . "
he is hoping his visit will help promote “ sensible arrangements . ”
but observers are skeptical . economics minister rainer bruederle has framed his two-day trip to china , which began in beijing on tuesday , as a pacifying mission , following recent acrimony between china and many g-20 countries over trade .
" the danger of a trade war has appeared on the horizon , " bruederle told reporters traveling with him on his two-day trip to china , which is to include stops in beijing and shanghai .
the minister warned that accusations of currency manipulation should not be allowed to escalate , and protectionism must be avoided .
some of china 's trading partners in the us and europe have recently accused beijing of allowing the yuan to depreciate at a faster pace .
critics say the unit could be undervalued by as much as 40 percent .
ambassador and missionary speaking in beijing , bruederle refuted these claims , pointing out that the yuan had increased in value by 15 to 17 percent in the past two years , and he added that he did not expect the chinese government to adopt flexible trading patterns in the future .
" we must not allow the situation to get out of hand , or turn our backs on free trade , " bruederle said , adding that he saw himself as an " ambassador , perhaps even a missionary , for the fight against protectionism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has faced pressure from the eu over currency depreciation bruederle expressed satisfaction with the state of german-chinese trade , which has grown significantly this year .
german exports to china have grown by 52 percent to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of this year , while chinese exports have risen by 34 percent , compared to 2009 figures .
germany is considered one of china 's best friends in the west .
" the germans have been pushing for an open trade policy towards china , " jonathan holslag of the brussels institute of contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" germany 's economic revival after the financial crisis has been - to a large degree - made in china . "
" most of the expansion in germany 's exports – particularly cars and machinery – has been bound for china , " says holslag .
for this reason , holslag believes , the german government has often cautioned against protectionism towards china .
" angela merkel has also openly expressed her support for granting china market economy status , " holslag points out .
" this would make it more difficult for the european commission to apply anti-dumping procedures . "
good on the small-scale , not so much on the large-scale but despite germany 's huge economic interest in china – not only through exports , but also through direct investment from individual companies – bruederle 's leverage during this trip is likely to be limited .
the minister said that one of his main aims for the trip was to ensure that medium-sized german businesses gained better opportunities in china .
after his meetings with chinese commerce minister chen deming and zhang ping , the head of the country 's top economic planning agency , bruederle said he had been assured that german companies could take part in open competition in china provided they used a minimum of 50 percent local products .
but holslag believes this is a secondary priority for bruederle compared to maintaining export agreements .
" it 's important to distinguish degrees of urgency , " he says .
" the most important objective for the german government is to step up exports , and the second level is access to the chinese market .
germany is likely to be very cautious in negotiations , in order to protect exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery has been largely based on exports to china but despite this , there is concern that german companies are being disadvantaged by the chinese government .
rolf langhammer , vice-president of the kiel institute for the world economy , believes that this is where bruederle can at least make sure german businesses can get their voices heard .
" germany enjoys a very good position in china compared to other european countries , but of course there are barriers to mid-sized german companies , " he told deutsche welle .
" a lot of representatives of these firms are accompanying bruederle . "
langhammer does not think that bruederle can apply much pressure on the question of global exchange rates – the issue he addressed on arrival .
" the chinese government has always made clear that it wo n't let itself be influenced on this subject , and bruederle 's visit wo n't change anything in the discussion about the exchange rate . "
langhammer is also unconvinced by bruederle 's attempt to position himself as a mediator between the china and the west .
" that 's a role he can not play , " he says .
" he is much too small for that .
he does n't speak for the eurozone , he speaks for an export country called germany .
of course he can represent the interests of mid-sized companies , and he can voice their concerns if they feel themselves disadvantaged alongside chinese competition , but he ca n't solve the big questions – and he ca n't be a mediator in them . "

but for various reasons the un security council has seldom functioned as it was intended .
history shows why . the security council , like the united nations itself , is a child of world war ii .
the decision to form the council was the centerpiece of the dumbarton oaks conference near washington in 1944 , at which the un was founded .
the idea was to create a body that , once nazi germany had been defeated , would allow the most powerful of the allied nations to act as one and prevent any similar acts of aggression .
" they were quite serious about it being a military command center , " david bosco , assistant professor of political science at american university and the author of a book on the security council , told deutsche welle .
" it was supposed to have what they called a military staff committee and countries were supposed to designate armed forces that would be used by the security council . "
by the time of the yalta conference in 1945 , the structure of institution was formalized and the five permanent members - the us , britain , france , china and the soviet union - were given the power of veto .
the so-called big three - the us , britain and the soviet union - insisted on this provision over the objections of the smaller of the 50 nations that joined the un .
the veto was intended to prevent the council from ever being used against its founding members .
but it also meant that all substantive decisions had to be unanimous , a situation that proved immediately problematic .
' no ' votes and empty seats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the details were finalized at a meeting between churchill , roosevelt and stalin in 1945 after world war ii , with the united states and the soviet union no longer allies but rivals , the divergent interests with the council were all too apparent .
the institution was only a month old when the soviet union exercised its veto power for the first time .
in the first 10 years of its existence , the soviet union vetoed 79 resolutions .
by january 1950 , the soviets were officially boycotting the council to protest the fact that china 's seat was occupied by the republic of china -lrb- today 's taiwan -rrb- rather than the communist people 's republic , which had emerged from the chinese civil war the proceeding year .
ironically , the soviet union 's " empty seat " policy allowed the council to show for the first time that it could act effectively .
" the security council was able to do relatively little in its first couple decades of operation , " bosco said .
" the exception was the korean war when the soviets were boycotting the council .
because they were boycotting , when the korean war broke out , the united states , the united kingdom and france were able to use the security council to push through resolutions condemning the -lsb- north korean -rsb- invasion of south korea and creating a un command to respond to that aggression . "
the un sent troops to korea on september 15 , 1950 and succeeded in pushing communist troops back to the north .
an armistice , which remains in force today , was agreed in 1953 .
the end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers , in their trademark blue helmets , were deployed most often in the 1990s american and soviet interests rarely coincided in the decades that followed , and with very few exceptions , such as the wars in the middle east in the 1960s and ' 70s , the council 's effectiveness was limited .
more often than not , as was the case with the cuban missile crisis , the institution was a stage for heated confrontations between the us and the soviet union .
that changed when mikhail gorbachev became soviet premier in 1985 .
at the time , one of the world 's most pressing security issues was the iran-iraq war .
" at a certain point , the permanent members decided to start having very quiet meetings amongst themselves to try to figure out a way to resolve that conflict , " bosco said .
the end of the cold war and the subsequent collapse of the soviet union broke through many of the ideological loggerheads and ushered in the council 's most productive period .
the council authorized un troops to drive iraqi forces from kuwait in 1990 , and the success of that operation inspired further missions .
" the activity of the council really peaks in 1993-1994 , when the council was passing dozens of resolutions - in the balkans , somalia , rwanda , just a lot of activity , " bosco explained .
" since that period there 's been a little of a retreat and some periods of lesser activity , but it 's never gone back to the -lsb- low -rsb- levels of the cold war . "
new dividing lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us secretary of state powell was unable to pursuade the council in 2003 the bolstered reputation that came with the increased effectiveness of the council took a serious knock in 2003 , when the us , unable to convince all of the permanent members to go to war against iraq , put together a " coalition of the willing " to topple iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
washington 's military-diplomatic run around the council reinforced stereotypes of the un as an impotent debating club rather than a global governing institution .
today , the us exercises its veto more often than any of the other permanent members .
the exclusive privileges of the permanent members also remain a perennial target for critics , who feel that the council 's structure no longer reflects the realities of power around the world .
some larger nations , including india , brazil and germany , have broached the idea that more permanent members should be added .
but for better or worse , the council remains the world 's premier global peacekeeping body .
and despite its inability to bring resolution to issues such as iran 's nuclear program , experts say its actions do have an effect .
" other countries are watching what 's happening with iran , watching it be isolated and its economy suffer , " bosco said .
" and they 're thinking : maybe we do n't want to go through that . "
fifty-five years on from its founding , the united nations security council still does n't function the way it was originally envisioned , but it does seem to be heading , however tentatively , in the right direction .

germany is up against portugal and canada . the 192-member general assembly convened in new york on tuesday to select five countries to serve two-year terms that begin on january 1 , 2011 .
the race for two of the seats on the united nations security council was expected to be tight , with germany , portugal and canada all vying for two non-permanent seats in the western europe and others category .
south africa , india , and colombia are running for the african , asian and latin american seats , respectively , and are almost certain to be elected on the first ballot , since their candidacies are unopposed .
germany confident german chancellor angela merkel , on the sidelines of the un millennium development summit in new york last month , campaigned personally for a seat on the security council .
foreign minister guido westerwelle , also at the summit , expressed confidence that his country would be named to the world body .
" germany is renowned around the world for its reliability , for its active pursuit of freedom and global development , " westerwelle told the general assembly and a host of world leaders at the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is confident that germany will be chosen he also referred in his speech to germany 's status as the third largest financial contributor to the united nations , in addition to insisting that berlin would continue to strive for peace as part of the security council .
" to be a member of the security council would mean a very important opportunity for germany .
it would mean that we could play an active role in establishing peace and disarmament around the world .
for , in the end , we must prevent countries around the world - among them even terrorist nations - from acquiring nuclear weapons . "
germany 's ambassador to the un , peter wittig , said ahead of tuesday 's vote that the country had been " working on the campaign for years , " adding that it would be " a significant contribution to germany 's position in the world . "
" canada and portugal are very strong candidates and they are close allies and friends .
secret votes are always unpredictable , but we are convinced that we have a very good chance , " wittig added .
5 + -lrb- 5 + 5 -rrb- = 15 the security council is composed of five permanent members who wield veto power : the united states , china , france , russia and britain .
ten other non-permanent members are selected to the body for two-year terms , with five replaced each year . the five categories represent the african , asian , latin-american , and western european and other geographical regions .
bildunterschrift : this vote is expected to be more interesting than those previous years diplomats see the 2011 race as more interesting than in previous years because of the presence of india , brazil and possibly germany -lrb- if elected on tuesday -rrb- , countries that have demanded permanent veto seats in the past .
permanent seat germany 's ultimate goal if elected to a non-permanent role on tuesday , germany says it will push to expand the 15-member council , which would greatly enhance its chances to become a permanent veto member .
the general assembly began discussion in the 1980s to reform and enlarge the security council from the current 15 to 21 or 26 members in order to reflect un membership 's demands for representation .
at the moment , the composition of the security council still reflects the distribution of political power as it stood at the end of the second world war .

when google contacted you , what happened ?
they were thankful for being so positive because this was a very big discussion in germany , -lsb- due to privacy -rsb- and taking pictures and everybody says we do n't want that .
we were one of the towns that said we would like -lsb- street view -rsb- .
tell me why you want google taking street view photographs in your town ?
what do you hope to accomplish other than to show how great the town is ?
i think that it would be an additional service for our guests .
when they are choosing a hotel or reading our brochures or they look at our homepage and they ca n't really say if everything is true , if there is a big street next to the hotel .
with google street view they can look into the town and discover the street , discover the region and after the holidays they can show their family and friends where they have been and what they can recommend .

have they actually sent a car to oberstaufen ?
they 've been here last year or at the beginning of this year .
they were in oberstaufen .
nobody saw them , though .
they took pictures and they have them and we 'll all waiting if there 's any chance that we can go on street view as soon as possible .
some have argued against street view because they say criminals could use it to plan robberies .
do you think that 's a valid argument ?
that 's a very interesting argument , because it 's one of the most important arguments for the critics but i think it 's crazy because the pictures were taken five or 10 months ago and they will be online for five or 10 years .
but if i want to get into a house and commit a crime , i wo n't use a picture that is many years old .
i could just use a postcard , for example , as a basis for burglary .
i think that 's not very realistic , but it 's very nice for a symbolic discussion .
are you surprised that there have n't been more cities that have welcomed google like oberstaufen has ?
i was not surprised because usually in germany you wait -lsb- to not draw attention to yourself -rsb- .
as long as you 're waiting , nobody is criticizing you .
i think it 's german , and it 's normal that no other towns really said , " we like google and we welcome google and we see a lot of positive aspects in this theme . "
after we said we like google and we support google street view , in our region , other towns and villages said , " we like would like to have them here , but you have to be the pioneer . "
we are glad that we decided to be very open .
now you mentioned earlier that you sent google a cake .
what kind of cake was it ?
i think it was a chocolate cake that was covered in frosting .
we just took a picture of the cake and sent the picture by e-mail , by twitter and we put it on facebook and we sent a real invitation that as soon as they come to take the other pictures of oberstaufen we will welcome them with the original cake .

germany is up against portugal and canada . the 192-member general assembly convened in new york on tuesday to select five countries to serve two-year terms that begin on january 1 , 2011 .
the race for two of the seats on the united nations security council was expected to be tight , with germany , portugal and canada all vying for two non-permanent seats in the western europe and others category .
south africa , india , and colombia are running for the african , asian and latin american seats , respectively , and are almost certain to be elected on the first ballot , since their candidacies are unopposed .
germany confident german chancellor angela merkel , on the sidelines of the un millennium development summit in new york last month , campaigned personally for a seat on the security council .
foreign minister guido westerwelle , also at the summit , expressed confidence that his country would be named to the world body .
" germany is renowned around the world for its reliability , for its active pursuit of freedom and global development , " westerwelle told the general assembly and a host of world leaders at the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is confident that germany will be chosen he also referred in his speech to germany 's status as the third largest financial contributor to the united nations , in addition to insisting that berlin would continue to strive for peace as part of the security council .
" to be a member of the security council would mean a very important opportunity for germany .
it would mean that we could play an active role in establishing peace and disarmament around the world .
for , in the end , we must prevent countries around the world - among them even terrorist nations - from acquiring nuclear weapons . "
germany 's ambassador to the un , peter wittig , said ahead of tuesday 's vote that the country had been " working on the campaign for years , " adding that it would be " a significant contribution to germany 's position in the world . "
" canada and portugal are very strong candidates and they are close allies and friends .
secret votes are always unpredictable , but we are convinced that we have a very good chance , " wittig added .
5 + -lrb- 5 + 5 -rrb- = 15 the security council is composed of five permanent members who wield veto power : the united states , china , france , russia and britain .
ten other non-permanent members are selected to the body for two-year terms , with five replaced each year . the five categories represent the african , asian , latin-american , and western european and other geographical regions .
bildunterschrift : this vote is expected to be more interesting than those previous years diplomats see the 2011 race as more interesting than in previous years because of the presence of india , brazil and possibly germany -lrb- if elected on tuesday -rrb- , countries that have demanded permanent veto seats in the past .
permanent seat germany 's ultimate goal if elected to a non-permanent role on tuesday , germany says it will push to expand the 15-member council , which would greatly enhance its chances to become a permanent veto member .
the general assembly began discussion in the 1980s to reform and enlarge the security council from the current 15 to 21 or 26 members in order to reflect un membership 's demands for representation .
at the moment , the composition of the security council still reflects the distribution of political power as it stood at the end of the second world war .

germany is up against portugal and canada . the 192-member general assembly convened in new york on tuesday to select five countries to serve two-year terms that begin on january 1 , 2011 .
the race for two of the seats on the united nations security council was expected to be tight , with germany , portugal and canada all vying for two non-permanent seats in the western europe and others category .
south africa , india , and colombia are running for the african , asian and latin american seats , respectively , and are almost certain to be elected on the first ballot , since their candidacies are unopposed .
germany confident german chancellor angela merkel , on the sidelines of the un millennium development summit in new york last month , campaigned personally for a seat on the security council .
foreign minister guido westerwelle , also at the summit , expressed confidence that his country would be named to the world body .
" germany is renowned around the world for its reliability , for its active pursuit of freedom and global development , " westerwelle told the general assembly and a host of world leaders at the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is confident that germany will be chosen he also referred in his speech to germany 's status as the third largest financial contributor to the united nations , in addition to insisting that berlin would continue to strive for peace as part of the security council .
" to be a member of the security council would mean a very important opportunity for germany .
it would mean that we could play an active role in establishing peace and disarmament around the world .
for , in the end , we must prevent countries around the world - among them even terrorist nations - from acquiring nuclear weapons . "
germany 's ambassador to the un , peter wittig , said ahead of tuesday 's vote that the country had been " working on the campaign for years , " adding that it would be " a significant contribution to germany 's position in the world . "
" canada and portugal are very strong candidates and they are close allies and friends .
secret votes are always unpredictable , but we are convinced that we have a very good chance , " wittig added .
5 + -lrb- 5 + 5 -rrb- = 15 the security council is composed of five permanent members who wield veto power : the united states , china , france , russia and britain .
ten other non-permanent members are selected to the body for two-year terms , with five replaced each year . the five categories represent the african , asian , latin-american , and western european and other geographical regions .
bildunterschrift : this vote is expected to be more interesting than those previous years diplomats see the 2011 race as more interesting than in previous years because of the presence of india , brazil and possibly germany -lrb- if elected on tuesday -rrb- , countries that have demanded permanent veto seats in the past .
permanent seat germany 's ultimate goal if elected to a non-permanent role on tuesday , germany says it will push to expand the 15-member council , which would greatly enhance its chances to become a permanent veto member .
the general assembly began discussion in the 1980s to reform and enlarge the security council from the current 15 to 21 or 26 members in order to reflect un membership 's demands for representation .
at the moment , the composition of the security council still reflects the distribution of political power as it stood at the end of the second world war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 12.10.2010 german economics minister warns of ' trade war ' with china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rainer bruederle arrived in china on tuesday economics minister rainer bruederle began his two-day trip to china with warnings of a " trade war . "
he is hoping his visit will help promote “ sensible arrangements . ”
but observers are skeptical . economics minister rainer bruederle has framed his two-day trip to china , which began in beijing on tuesday , as a pacifying mission , following recent acrimony between china and many g-20 countries over trade .
" the danger of a trade war has appeared on the horizon , " bruederle told reporters traveling with him on his two-day trip to china , which is to include stops in beijing and shanghai .
the minister warned that accusations of currency manipulation should not be allowed to escalate , and protectionism must be avoided .
some of china 's trading partners in the us and europe have recently accused beijing of allowing the yuan to depreciate at a faster pace .
critics say the unit could be undervalued by as much as 40 percent .
ambassador and missionary speaking in beijing , bruederle refuted these claims , pointing out that the yuan had increased in value by 15 to 17 percent in the past two years , and he added that he did not expect the chinese government to adopt flexible trading patterns in the future .
" we must not allow the situation to get out of hand , or turn our backs on free trade , " bruederle said , adding that he saw himself as an " ambassador , perhaps even a missionary , for the fight against protectionism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has faced pressure from the eu over currency depreciation bruederle expressed satisfaction with the state of german-chinese trade , which has grown significantly this year .
german exports to china have grown by 52 percent to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of this year , while chinese exports have risen by 34 percent , compared to 2009 figures .
germany is considered one of china 's best friends in the west .
" the germans have been pushing for an open trade policy towards china , " jonathan holslag of the brussels institute of contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" germany 's economic revival after the financial crisis has been - to a large degree - made in china . "
" most of the expansion in germany 's exports – particularly cars and machinery – has been bound for china , " says holslag .
for this reason , holslag believes , the german government has often cautioned against protectionism towards china .
" angela merkel has also openly expressed her support for granting china market economy status , " holslag points out .
" this would make it more difficult for the european commission to apply anti-dumping procedures . "
good on the small-scale , not so much on the large-scale but despite germany 's huge economic interest in china – not only through exports , but also through direct investment from individual companies – bruederle 's leverage during this trip is likely to be limited .
the minister said that one of his main aims for the trip was to ensure that medium-sized german businesses gained better opportunities in china .
after his meetings with chinese commerce minister chen deming and zhang ping , the head of the country 's top economic planning agency , bruederle said he had been assured that german companies could take part in open competition in china provided they used a minimum of 50 percent local products .
but holslag believes this is a secondary priority for bruederle compared to maintaining export agreements .
" it 's important to distinguish degrees of urgency , " he says .
" the most important objective for the german government is to step up exports , and the second level is access to the chinese market .
germany is likely to be very cautious in negotiations , in order to protect exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery has been largely based on exports to china but despite this , there is concern that german companies are being disadvantaged by the chinese government .
rolf langhammer , vice-president of the kiel institute for the world economy , believes that this is where bruederle can at least make sure german businesses can get their voices heard .
" germany enjoys a very good position in china compared to other european countries , but of course there are barriers to mid-sized german companies , " he told deutsche welle .
" a lot of representatives of these firms are accompanying bruederle . "
langhammer does not think that bruederle can apply much pressure on the question of global exchange rates – the issue he addressed on arrival .
" the chinese government has always made clear that it wo n't let itself be influenced on this subject , and bruederle 's visit wo n't change anything in the discussion about the exchange rate . "
langhammer is also unconvinced by bruederle 's attempt to position himself as a mediator between the china and the west .
" that 's a role he can not play , " he says .
" he is much too small for that .
he does n't speak for the eurozone , he speaks for an export country called germany .
of course he can represent the interests of mid-sized companies , and he can voice their concerns if they feel themselves disadvantaged alongside chinese competition , but he ca n't solve the big questions – and he ca n't be a mediator in them . "

however , one city in the southern state of bavaria , oberstaufen , has publicly supported google street view - and may be the only city in the country that has supported the company to such a great degree .
in an interview with deutsche welle , bianca keybach , the head of oberstaufen 's tourist office , explained why the city even went so far as to bake for google .
deutsche welle : oberstaufen made a video and even baked a cake for google .
is that right ? bianca keybach : yes , we made a cake for google to welcome them and we put it into our facebook fan page and afterward we sent an invitation to google to say that we would be glad to welcome them here , and then google contacted us and we will see what happens .
when google contacted you , what happened ?
they were thankful for being so positive because this was a very big discussion in germany , -lsb- due to privacy -rsb- and taking pictures and everybody says we do n't want that .
we were one of the towns that said we would like -lsb- street view -rsb- .
tell me why you want google taking street view photographs in your town ?
what do you hope to accomplish other than to show how great the town is ?
i think that it would be an additional service for our guests .
when they are choosing a hotel or reading our brochures or they look at our homepage and they ca n't really say if everything is true , if there is a big street next to the hotel .
with google street view they can look into the town and discover the street , discover the region and after the holidays they can show their family and friends where they have been and what they can recommend .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bianca keybach is the head of oberstaufen 's tourism office google has sent out their street view vehicles to big cities around germany , and they 're going to be releasing the photos for the 20 biggest cities around germany later this year .
have they actually sent a car to oberstaufen ?
they 've been here last year or at the beginning of this year .
they were in oberstaufen .
nobody saw them , though .
they took pictures and they have them and we 'll all waiting if there 's any chance that we can go on street view as soon as possible .
some have argued against street view because they say criminals could use it to plan robberies .
do you think that 's a valid argument ?
that 's a very interesting argument , because it 's one of the most important arguments for the critics but i think it 's crazy because the pictures were taken five or 10 months ago and they will be online for five or 10 years .
but if i want to get into a house and commit a crime , i wo n't use a picture that is many years old .
i could just use a postcard , for example , as a basis for burglary .
i think that 's not very realistic , but it 's very nice for a symbolic discussion .
are you surprised that there have n't been more cities that have welcomed google like oberstaufen has ?
i was not surprised because usually in germany you wait -lsb- to not draw attention to yourself -rsb- .
as long as you 're waiting , nobody is criticizing you .
i think it 's german , and it 's normal that no other towns really said , " we like google and we welcome google and we see a lot of positive aspects in this theme . "
after we said we like google and we support google street view , in our region , other towns and villages said , " we like would like to have them here , but you have to be the pioneer . "
we are glad that we decided to be very open .
now you mentioned earlier that you sent google a cake .
what kind of cake was it ?
i think it was a chocolate cake that was covered in frosting .
we just took a picture of the cake and sent the picture by e-mail , by twitter and we put it on facebook and we sent a real invitation that as soon as they come to take the other pictures of oberstaufen we will welcome them with the original cake .

"
he is hoping his visit will help promote “ sensible arrangements . ”
but observers are skeptical . economics minister rainer bruederle has framed his two-day trip to china , which began in beijing on tuesday , as a pacifying mission , following recent acrimony between china and many g-20 countries over trade .
" the danger of a trade war has appeared on the horizon , " bruederle told reporters traveling with him on his two-day trip to china , which is to include stops in beijing and shanghai .
the minister warned that accusations of currency manipulation should not be allowed to escalate , and protectionism must be avoided .
some of china 's trading partners in the us and europe have recently accused beijing of allowing the yuan to depreciate at a faster pace .
critics say the unit could be undervalued by as much as 40 percent .
ambassador and missionary speaking in beijing , bruederle refuted these claims , pointing out that the yuan had increased in value by 15 to 17 percent in the past two years , and he added that he did not expect the chinese government to adopt flexible trading patterns in the future .
" we must not allow the situation to get out of hand , or turn our backs on free trade , " bruederle said , adding that he saw himself as an " ambassador , perhaps even a missionary , for the fight against protectionism . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has faced pressure from the eu over currency depreciation bruederle expressed satisfaction with the state of german-chinese trade , which has grown significantly this year .
german exports to china have grown by 52 percent to 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 42 billion -rrb- in the first seven months of this year , while chinese exports have risen by 34 percent , compared to 2009 figures .
germany is considered one of china 's best friends in the west .
" the germans have been pushing for an open trade policy towards china , " jonathan holslag of the brussels institute of contemporary china studies -lrb- biccs -rrb- told deutsche welle .
" germany 's economic revival after the financial crisis has been - to a large degree - made in china . "
" most of the expansion in germany 's exports – particularly cars and machinery – has been bound for china , " says holslag .
for this reason , holslag believes , the german government has often cautioned against protectionism towards china .
" angela merkel has also openly expressed her support for granting china market economy status , " holslag points out .
" this would make it more difficult for the european commission to apply anti-dumping procedures . "
good on the small-scale , not so much on the large-scale but despite germany 's huge economic interest in china – not only through exports , but also through direct investment from individual companies – bruederle 's leverage during this trip is likely to be limited .
the minister said that one of his main aims for the trip was to ensure that medium-sized german businesses gained better opportunities in china .
after his meetings with chinese commerce minister chen deming and zhang ping , the head of the country 's top economic planning agency , bruederle said he had been assured that german companies could take part in open competition in china provided they used a minimum of 50 percent local products .
but holslag believes this is a secondary priority for bruederle compared to maintaining export agreements .
" it 's important to distinguish degrees of urgency , " he says .
" the most important objective for the german government is to step up exports , and the second level is access to the chinese market .
germany is likely to be very cautious in negotiations , in order to protect exports . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's recovery has been largely based on exports to china but despite this , there is concern that german companies are being disadvantaged by the chinese government .
rolf langhammer , vice-president of the kiel institute for the world economy , believes that this is where bruederle can at least make sure german businesses can get their voices heard .
" germany enjoys a very good position in china compared to other european countries , but of course there are barriers to mid-sized german companies , " he told deutsche welle .
" a lot of representatives of these firms are accompanying bruederle . "
langhammer does not think that bruederle can apply much pressure on the question of global exchange rates – the issue he addressed on arrival .
" the chinese government has always made clear that it wo n't let itself be influenced on this subject , and bruederle 's visit wo n't change anything in the discussion about the exchange rate . "
langhammer is also unconvinced by bruederle 's attempt to position himself as a mediator between the china and the west .
" that 's a role he can not play , " he says .
" he is much too small for that .
he does n't speak for the eurozone , he speaks for an export country called germany .
of course he can represent the interests of mid-sized companies , and he can voice their concerns if they feel themselves disadvantaged alongside chinese competition , but he ca n't solve the big questions – and he ca n't be a mediator in them . "

the move is part of the bank 's long slog towards re-privatization . state-owned german bank hypo real estate -lrb- hre -rrb- is planning to return some 23.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 32.5 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees to the federal government , according to a report in the financial daily handelsblatt .
the guarantees were part of a 142-billion-euro state support package the bank received along with 10 billion euros in cash to keep it from collapsing during the financial crisis .
hre kept the guarantees in reserve to ensure the smooth division of its assets among two new entities earlier this month .
some 173 billion euros of risky assets were transferred to a so-called " bad bank " named fms wertmanagement .
the healthy parts of hre ’ s balance sheet were consolidated to form the deutsche pfandbriefbank -lrb- pbb -rrb- .
although this " good bank " still depends on substantial state guarantees to reassure creditors and obtain financing on favorable terms , it no longer requires the full volume of public funds placed at its disposal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bank has been under state control for a year divide to survive " hre does n't exist anymore .
it 's just the deutsche pfandbriefbank and the bad bank , " konrad becker , banking analyst for private banking company merck finck , told deutsche welle .
" the name is still used in the media because it 's well-known and infamous and does n't need explaining , but the fact is it no longer exists . "
" what we 're witnessing is the attempt to make at least a part of hre viable , " becker said . " we saw a split between the assets that are no longer seen as strategically important – these all went to the bad bank – and those considered important , primarily the covered bonds and the mortgages that can be re-financed through bonds – these were put into the pbb deutsche pfandbriefbank , which is now expected to continue . "
the division was part of a salvage plan set down over a year ago , but the ultimate goal of re-privatization is still a long way off , according to becker .
" it 's impossible to speculate when the bank can be re-privatized , " he said .
" there are no official figures yet , but i think the bank will have to show an operating profit first . "
" people are really cautious .
so many people have lost so much money with hre , and everyone knows where deutsche pfandbriefbank came from .
i think the bank will have to prove that it is profitable for two or three years , and at the end of these two or three years it will have to show a business model that can convince investors . "
in order to meet these aims , hre has been positioning itself more modestly as a property financier for europe , and decided to stop taking on new business in asia and the us .

the country is ethnically divided along bosniak , serb and croat lines .
" hatreds have eased , but nationalism persists , " she said .
" meanwhile , the promise of greater stability and opportunity , represented by integration into europe , remains out of reach .

earlier , she warned bosnia it was falling behind in integrating with europe . us secretary of state hillary clinton has praised the decision by balkan nation serbia to return to talks with its breakaway province of kosovo , in an effort to resolve the long-running standoff over kosovo ’ s 2008 declaration of independence .
" that dialog can and will benefit people in kosovo and in serbia by addressing practical , day-to-day issues and the long-term relationship between you , " clinton said after talks with serbian president boris tadic in belgrade .
tadic , meanwhile , said serbia wanted " to be predictable partners , " adding that " only in that way will we rebuild trust . "
many serbians still remember clinton 's husband , former us president bill clinton , as the leader who supported the 1999 nato bombing that led to serbia 's withdrawal from kosovo .
praise for police clinton also used her visit to belgrade to praise serbian police for protecting a weekend gay pride march from attacks , as prosecutors opened a criminal investigation against the leader of a far-right group for orchestrating the violent anti-gay protests .
" i especially want to commend the bravery of the police who provided security for the event at last sunday 's pride parade , " clinton said .
" it was not easy , and yet we watched as the official law enforcement forces demonstrated unequivocally your support for the rights of all . "
more than 150 people were injured sunday in downtown belgrade in running battles with police as thousands of far-right demonstrators tried to disrupt the march by hurling molotov cocktails and stun grenades at police .

some say this ban on trading in ' impure ' wares is keeping businesses from signing on the dotted line . berlin 's inner-city ernst-reuter square is a prime business location , housing the offices of companies from around the world .
but the nine-storey office building at no. 2 stands half empty with a huge billboard near the entrance offering office space .
this is at least in part because of a number of restrictions placed on commercial tenants of the building .
" companies seeking to rent office space here are not allowed to operate business that involves selling pork " , said simone krziwanek , a lawyer representing a small communications firm on the groundfloor of the building .
what is also banned , she said , are businesses offering " interest-paying financial products , as well as sex shops , gambling halls and liquor stores " .

"
outcry over sharia laws the building was once the berlin headquarters of the american computer giant international business machines , ibm .

on monday , germany 's mass-circulation newspaper bild published details of the controversial rental contracts , describing their clauses as " sharia laws and multi-cultural madness which is now also undermining german business . "
chicago-based property developer jones , lang , lasallem which is marketing the building in the name of the arab investor , ca n't understand the " fuss " that has been made about the contracts .
" quite frankly , most of the preconditions are not unusual , besides maybe the pork meat clause , " ruediger thraene , the firm 's berlin representative told deutsche welle .
he said clauses excluding the sex business , drugs , alcohol and gambling were " quite common and part of many contracts for office space in germany . "
political dimension according to the german association of property owners , the commercial property market in berlin is attractive for international investors , notably for those coming from rich countries in the arab world .

" there 's always a political dimension in what they see as a clash with western civilization .

earlier , she warned bosnia it was falling behind in integrating with europe . us secretary of state hillary clinton has praised the decision by balkan nation serbia to return to talks with its breakaway province of kosovo , in an effort to resolve the long-running standoff over kosovo ’ s 2008 declaration of independence .
" that dialog can and will benefit people in kosovo and in serbia by addressing practical , day-to-day issues and the long-term relationship between you , " clinton said after talks with serbian president boris tadic in belgrade .
tadic , meanwhile , said serbia wanted " to be predictable partners , " adding that " only in that way will we rebuild trust . "
many serbians still remember clinton 's husband , former us president bill clinton , as the leader who supported the 1999 nato bombing that led to serbia 's withdrawal from kosovo .
praise for police clinton also used her visit to belgrade to praise serbian police for protecting a weekend gay pride march from attacks , as prosecutors opened a criminal investigation against the leader of a far-right group for orchestrating the violent anti-gay protests .
" i especially want to commend the bravery of the police who provided security for the event at last sunday 's pride parade , " clinton said .
" it was not easy , and yet we watched as the official law enforcement forces demonstrated unequivocally your support for the rights of all . "
more than 150 people were injured sunday in downtown belgrade in running battles with police as thousands of far-right demonstrators tried to disrupt the march by hurling molotov cocktails and stun grenades at police .
clinton : bosnia must do more bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton was welcomed by the serbian people earlier tuesday , clinton visited bosnia , where she warned the balkan country it was falling behind its neighbors in integrating with europe .
she said bosnia risked having its hopes of joining the european union and nato dashed unless it starts bridging its internal political and ethnic divide .
the country is ethnically divided along bosniak , serb and croat lines .
" hatreds have eased , but nationalism persists , " she said .
" meanwhile , the promise of greater stability and opportunity , represented by integration into europe , remains out of reach .
" your neighbors have taken strides in that direction , " clinton continued .
" now is the time for the citizens of this country to make your voices heard . "
clinton will travel to kosovo on wednesday on the second and final day of her diplomatic tour of the war-torn region .
she is expected to push the government in pristina to make the most of talks with serbia .
the us is among 70 states , including most of the 27 eu countries , to have recognized kosovo 's independence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de privacy -pipe- 12.10.2010 deadline looms for germans to blur homes from google street view großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last day for germans to opt-out is october 15 google plans to launch its street view project in germany 's 20 biggest cities by the end of the year .
but not all germans are happy that their homes , cars and even themselves could be online for all to see . some 1 million germans make use of the street view service daily for a virtual ground 's eye look of the world , according to google .
but the company has been heavily criticized in germany as it gets ready to put maps of german cities online , which the company plans to do by the end of the year .
much of that criticism has come from the southern german state of bavaria , and the region around the city of ingolstadt in particular .
" the problem with google street view is that google - without asking - has gone and photographed german houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used , " georg schaeff , the publisher of the ingolstadt-based daily donaukurier , told deutsche welle .
the newspaper has publicized local opposition to the service for the last two years .
that 's a problem in germany since the country 's highest court has affirmed citizens ' rights to control who has their personal information and how it 's used .
google gives ground " we take privacy very seriously , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service . "
the california tech giant has made concessions to german privacy advocates by allowing material to be made unrecognizable before being published , which it has n't done in the other 23 countries street view is online .
furthermore , after facing widespread criticism , it doubled the opt-out period to eight weeks , which ends on friday .
some 200,000 people have taken google up on the offer to have their homes or apartment building blurred , according to a report in the german news magazine der spiegel .
google , which automatically blurs the faces and vehicle license plates its computer can recognize and asks users to point out the ones it misses , has not commented on the number of opt-out it has received .
bildunterschrift : some 200,000 people have removed themselves from street view , a german magazine reported but schaeff said people have no way of making sure what they see as a violation of their privacy really gets deleted .
he added that citizens have little recourse if google does n't agree with their claim of a privacy infringement by the panoramic photos of whatever is visible from the street taken by the eight cameras mounted on the company 's car .
" individual citizens ca n't assert themselves against these kinds of companies , " he said .
" and the corporations do n't bother to consider if what they are doing is illegal or not .
google works on the premise of ' why ask for permission when you can beg for forgiveness after the fact ? " '
privacy rift but privacy advocates still have a lot of convincing to do .
some 41 percent of germans see more positive than negative aspects to street view and 16 percent say they have or will remove their homes from the service , according to an august study by the emnid research institute .
many ingolstadt locals agreed with the poll 's sentiment .
" google can go ahead and do it , because everyone leaves their tracks all over the internet and everywhere else , " said ingo zingel , an ingolstadt resident .
" whether someone takes a picture of the door to my house really does n't matter . "
schaeff said he 's not surprised that some people do n't seem concerned about what 's happening to their personal information .
" i think there is a rift in society where half the people do n't see a problem and do n't know what 's coming down the road , " he said .
" the other half is much more sensitive and is more careful because the situation is far from clear . "
what 's unclear , he added , is how images from street view - or any other type of geodata , such as that collected by mobile phone providers - can be used to create profiles of individuals that are later sold to third parties .
without knowing how personal data will be used , he said people should give out as little as possible .
" each piece of personal information is like a stone that creates a mosaic , " schaeff said .
" every little stone plays a meaningful role , but , unfortunately , you ca n't tell what the role is until the whole picture has been made . "
' sensible areas ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 41 percent germans said street view has more positive than negative aspects but there are some pictures thomas herker , the mayor of pfaffenhofen , just south of ingolstadt , said he knows he does n't want made .
while he insisted that city hall and pubic offices be visible in street view , he added that some public buildings should be unrecognizable on the internet .
" we requested that google remove public kindergartens and schools , " he said referring to a letter the city sent in december 2009 to google 's german headquarters in hamburg .
" two weeks ago we were told they would not do it because only private individuals - not municipalities - have a right to remove property . "
herker led a group of bavarian mayors which sent another request to google asking for the company to respect their wishes and remove kindergartens and other " sensible areas " from street view .
while herker is left hoping google accounts for his city 's wishes , the point may become moot if the service goes online as planned by the end of the year .
the last time herker wrote to google it took 10 months to get a form letter response .
if it takes that long again the pictures will have long been online for all to see .
" there are three companies in germany that , in my opinion , are problematic : deutsche telekom , deutsche bahn , and now i 've added google to the list , " he said .
" i can only hope that google will change its mind and make it possible to remove public property from the service . "

but not all germans are happy that their homes , cars and even themselves could be online for all to see . some 1 million germans make use of the street view service daily for a virtual ground 's eye look of the world , according to google .
but the company has been heavily criticized in germany as it gets ready to put maps of german cities online , which the company plans to do by the end of the year .
much of that criticism has come from the southern german state of bavaria , and the region around the city of ingolstadt in particular .
" the problem with google street view is that google - without asking - has gone and photographed german houses and streets and people do not know how the information is used , " georg schaeff , the publisher of the ingolstadt-based daily donaukurier , told deutsche welle .
the newspaper has publicized local opposition to the service for the last two years .
that 's a problem in germany since the country 's highest court has affirmed citizens ' rights to control who has their personal information and how it 's used .
google gives ground " we take privacy very seriously , " said lena wagner , a google germany spokesperson , in an e-mail sent to deutsche welle .
" while the street view feature enables people to easily find , discover , and plan activities relevant to a location , we respect the fact that people may not want certain types of images featured on the service . "
the california tech giant has made concessions to german privacy advocates by allowing material to be made unrecognizable before being published , which it has n't done in the other 23 countries street view is online .
furthermore , after facing widespread criticism , it doubled the opt-out period to eight weeks , which ends on friday .
some 200,000 people have taken google up on the offer to have their homes or apartment building blurred , according to a report in the german news magazine der spiegel .
google , which automatically blurs the faces and vehicle license plates its computer can recognize and asks users to point out the ones it misses , has not commented on the number of opt-out it has received .
bildunterschrift : some 200,000 people have removed themselves from street view , a german magazine reported but schaeff said people have no way of making sure what they see as a violation of their privacy really gets deleted .
he added that citizens have little recourse if google does n't agree with their claim of a privacy infringement by the panoramic photos of whatever is visible from the street taken by the eight cameras mounted on the company 's car .
" individual citizens ca n't assert themselves against these kinds of companies , " he said .
" and the corporations do n't bother to consider if what they are doing is illegal or not .
google works on the premise of ' why ask for permission when you can beg for forgiveness after the fact ? " '
privacy rift but privacy advocates still have a lot of convincing to do .
some 41 percent of germans see more positive than negative aspects to street view and 16 percent say they have or will remove their homes from the service , according to an august study by the emnid research institute .
many ingolstadt locals agreed with the poll 's sentiment .
" google can go ahead and do it , because everyone leaves their tracks all over the internet and everywhere else , " said ingo zingel , an ingolstadt resident .
" whether someone takes a picture of the door to my house really does n't matter . "
schaeff said he 's not surprised that some people do n't seem concerned about what 's happening to their personal information .
" i think there is a rift in society where half the people do n't see a problem and do n't know what 's coming down the road , " he said .
" the other half is much more sensitive and is more careful because the situation is far from clear . "
what 's unclear , he added , is how images from street view - or any other type of geodata , such as that collected by mobile phone providers - can be used to create profiles of individuals that are later sold to third parties .
without knowing how personal data will be used , he said people should give out as little as possible .
" each piece of personal information is like a stone that creates a mosaic , " schaeff said .
" every little stone plays a meaningful role , but , unfortunately , you ca n't tell what the role is until the whole picture has been made . "
' sensible areas ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 41 percent germans said street view has more positive than negative aspects but there are some pictures thomas herker , the mayor of pfaffenhofen , just south of ingolstadt , said he knows he does n't want made .
while he insisted that city hall and pubic offices be visible in street view , he added that some public buildings should be unrecognizable on the internet .
" we requested that google remove public kindergartens and schools , " he said referring to a letter the city sent in december 2009 to google 's german headquarters in hamburg .
" two weeks ago we were told they would not do it because only private individuals - not municipalities - have a right to remove property . "
herker led a group of bavarian mayors which sent another request to google asking for the company to respect their wishes and remove kindergartens and other " sensible areas " from street view .
while herker is left hoping google accounts for his city 's wishes , the point may become moot if the service goes online as planned by the end of the year .
the last time herker wrote to google it took 10 months to get a form letter response .
if it takes that long again the pictures will have long been online for all to see .
" there are three companies in germany that , in my opinion , are problematic : deutsche telekom , deutsche bahn , and now i 've added google to the list , " he said .
" i can only hope that google will change its mind and make it possible to remove public property from the service . "

walkouts reduced flights from paris 's main airports by as much as 50 percent .
around 30 percent of france 's high-speed tgv trains were running , with the paris metro also running a limited service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no tourists climbed the eifel tower on tuesday afternoon during the afternoon , the eifel tower was closed due to lack of staff , and hundreds of schools were shut down throughout the country .
students in paris chanted slogans , waved banners and climbed up on the roofs of bus shelters with loudspeakers .
" this law ignores the reality for young people , " said eloi simon , 21 , a student near paris .
" it 's hard enough to find a steady job and if this goes through it will be even harder , " she added .
sarkozy pledges to persevere sarkozy 's pension plan is quickly becoming one of the biggest battles of his presidency , pitting him against unions that crushed a previous attempt to reform the system in 1995 .
his administration , however , is refusing to buckle under the pressure . " we have reached the limit of the -lrb- concessions -rrb- that are possible , " prime minister francois fillon said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sarkozy administration says it wo n't back down the french senate voted on monday to raise the age at which workers can retire on full pensions from 65 to 67 , after already voting on raising the age for early retirement from 60 to 62 .
sarkozy has already made small concessions in the reform legislation , but has said he will not back down on the bill 's key points .
union leaders , meanwhile , vow to keep up the pressure with a fourth pension protest in just over a month , pledging further that it would n't be the last .
" from this point on the question is whether we need to have open-ended strikes , " jean-claude mailly , head of the more radical force ouvriere union told reporters .
unions have called a further day of protest on oct .
16 and will meet again on wednesday to review their position .
nonetheless , the government hopes to have its pension and retirement reforms passed by the end of the month .

europe 's social affairs commissioner said financial help is available to member states . the european commission will once again push member states to do more to improve the situation for roma travelers on tuesday at a conference in bucharest .
the meeting was organized after the french government began its deportations of roma families over the summer , drawing international criticism .
the bucharest conference aims to promote the better use of eu funds to improve the socio-economic situation of the 10 to 12 million roma living on the continent .
they face discrimination , poverty , segregation , and barriers to education and the labor market in many of the european countries in which they settle .
in slovakia , for example , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education .
in bulgaria , over 50 percent of roma are unemployed .
in romania only about a quarter of roma have a steady job .
european funds are under-used in recent years the european union has brought in a comprehensive financial program to promote the integration of the roma and sinti travelers .
but romania and bulgaria , the eu member states with the biggest roma communities , have made little use of the subsidies .
despite the high-profile debate about integration of roma sparked by france 's crackdown on its traveling community , the european union 's commissioner for social affairs and inclusion complained recently that few nations are drawing on the available financial aid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laszlo andor wants countries to make better use of european funds " i would like to stress that this is the responsibility of the european union and the member states together , " andor said in the european parliament .
" the structural funds offer a very useful financial lever for supporting national efforts to improve the situation of the roma .
however , eu funds are often not fully used , or not used in the most effective way . "
currently romania is only using 1 percent of the 2.25 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.1 billion -rrb- made available by the european social fund between 2007 and 2013 to improve the situation of vulnerable groups .
bulgaria is only using 5 percent of the fund .
integration is not just about money however , there is of course no compulsion to use the money .
the german conservative mep manfred weber hopes there is enough incentive for countries to apply for the money if they need it .
" the decisive factor in integration of course is always that it ca n't be proscribed from above , rather it 's got to happen in the towns , in the communities themselves , " weber told deutsche welle .
" it demands creativity . "
the european commission has set up a working group to assess why the roma struggle so much with integration .
the group will deliver its findings by the end of the year .
in the meantime andor wants member states to set ambitious targets for tackling poverty and improving the educational horizons of the roma .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in slovakia , only 3 percent of roma children finish secondary education " it 's only about poverty reduction , it 's not only about social inclusion , " the commissioner said .
" we have to ensure that the roma are explicitly mentioned in our new employment flagship initiative , because that 's also where a breakthrough has to be made . "
manfred weber believes governments have to tackle the root of the problem by targeting education .
“ we have to follow through the idea that children of this ethnic minority must attend school .
only then can we succeed in truly integrating these travelling families into european societies . ”
the problems for the roma in europe are not new .
there is money available in europe to tackle it .
but it has taken the row over the policy of deporting roma from france to bring this much-beleaguered community into the spotlight .

the two-day conference is being held in the romanian capital , bucharest . european union officials , romanian politicians and roma representatives are discussing integration issues regarding europe 's roma population at a two-day eu conference held in romania 's capital , bucharest .
the conference is aimed at finding solutions on how to achieve more with the money spent by the european union on integrating roma , said the european commissioner for employment and social affairs , laszlo andor , at the opening of the conference .
" a lot has been done in terms of strategic planning , coordination and implementation , but at the end of the day , not much has really changed . " he said .
andor wants eu member states to become more engaged in integrating their roma population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " not much has really changed " - andor said at the conference " the eu can not solve the multi-layered problems of the roma by itself , " he said .
" the european union is ready to step up its efforts for roma integration , but that is also what we expect from all member states . "
funding is available , yet few members take the money even though the european union has funds available , member states refrain from using the money .
from 2007 until 2013 , the european social fund offered 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 18.1 billion -rrb- to help finance education and housing projects for roma .
especially countries with a high number of roma population like hungary , bulgaria and romania were expected make use of the funds .
the eu has installed a task force in order to find out why member states do not act even though the funds are available .
the task force is expected to present its results by the end of this year .
hungarian prime minister viktor orban said that the integration of roma would be one of the main focuses in hungary 's term in the eu presidency beginning in january .
according to andor , france 's drastic measures of expelling thousands of roma were " very unfortunate " , but " ironically energized the discussions on roma inclusion . "
problem of roma integration will not affect schengen talks german chancellor angela merkel said after a meeting romanian prime minister emil boc that the problem of roma integration would not affect negotiations on romania becoming part of the schengen zone .
being a country within the schengen treaty would give romanian citizen visa-free travel within the european union .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a long way from the end of the road , " - according to chancellor merkel merkel said that germany would judge romania 's development on their way to the schengen treaty fairly - but did not promise a quick entrance to the schengen zone .
" the reforms of the judiciary and of interior affairs are being tackled very courageously , but you are still a long way from the end of the road , " merkel said . " we back romania 's efforts to join the schengen zone ... but we must make sure that visa delivery procedures are not marred by corruption , " she said .
it is crucial that romania only issue visas without signs of corruption or unregularities and that eu 's external borders are safe .
" there are no reasonable alternatives to transparent and clear legal terms . " romania is hoping to enter the schengen zone in the middle of 2011 .
the country has been a member of the eu since 2007 .
most of europe 's roma are said to live in romania , but there are no reliable numbers - with figures ranging from a population of 530,000 up to 2.5 million .

" learn german !
adjust to the customs of your host country , " he told daily newspaper bild in an interview published on tuesday .
" you do n't have to give up the gift of your identity and culture , but rather think of yourselves as ambassadors for turkey .
only then can you build bridges for a better friendship and partnership between our countries . "
three days before his comments were published , german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan met in berlin on the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between the two countries , pledging to cooperate more on integration of turks living in germany .
multi-faceted integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to work together on integration ines michalowski , a senior researcher at berlin 's social science research center , said the call for turkish-germans to maintain their culture while still adjusting to german customs may seem paradoxical , but that the two are not mutually exclusive .
" the turkish nation-state is a very nationalistic nation , where there are actually claims of turks belonging to the turkish nation-state even though they have been living abroad for several generations , " she told deutsche welle .
" but that does n't mean that integration on the labor market , or in the educational system , or contacts with germans - that these aspects of integration go badly . "
still , research shows that most turkish germans are poorly integrated in these areas - a fact which haci halil uslucan , director of the center for turkish studies and integration research , said can not be entirely attributed to a perceived lack of motivation of immigrants to integrate themselves .
" i think we also have to focus on the conditions of being integrated - and that means the attitudes of the majority , the look of the majority on the minority , " he told deutsche welle .
" the political discussion should not go in this direction of creating ranks - these are the good immigrants and these are the bad ones .
that only increases social tension . "
education is key bagis also said in his interview that turkish-german parents should send their children " to the best schools , so that they have a future , " echoing comments by prime minister erdogan that turkish-germans should prioritize education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research shows other minorities have integrated better than turks michalowski said studies of vietnamese immigrant parents in the eastern state of brandenburg have shown their children to have higher high-school graduation and college entrance rates than non-immigrant german children , partly because the parents place a high priority on education .
" some of the criticism has been that maybe turkish parents are not putting enough emphasis on getting a good education within germany , " she said .
" so if there is a government official from turkey who actually encourages people to pay more attention to the education of their children , i think that can never do any harm . "
but uslucan said other research shows that turkish-german parents have high educational aspirations for their children , and that teachers often send young turkish students to lower-level high schools that do not feed into universities , even when their educational performance is as good as their non-turkish peers .
" the doctrine must be that turkish parents should have more information about the german educational system , " he said .
" i think there is the problem that turkish parents do n't have enough information on what the best school is . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has made entry into the eu a high priority ambassadors for turkish eu accession in addition to his post as eu affairs minister , bagis is also chiefly responsible for negotiating turkey 's accession into the bloc .
while merkel has called turkey 's accession process " open-ended with no guarantees , " the turkish government has made it a high priority .
michalowski said bagis 's call on immigrants to integrate could be seen as a way of enhancing turkey 's chances of gaining eu membership .
" if you have a well-integrated minority , people in germany may be more favorable to the idea of turkey becoming a member of the european union than if the turkish community is always in the media as being badly integrated , " she said .

" learn german !
adjust to the customs of your host country , " he told daily newspaper bild in an interview published on tuesday .
" you do n't have to give up the gift of your identity and culture , but rather think of yourselves as ambassadors for turkey .
only then can you build bridges for a better friendship and partnership between our countries . "
three days before his comments were published , german chancellor angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan met in berlin on the 50th anniversary of a guest worker pact between the two countries , pledging to cooperate more on integration of turks living in germany .
multi-faceted integration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and erdogan pledged to work together on integration ines michalowski , a senior researcher at berlin 's social science research center , said the call for turkish-germans to maintain their culture while still adjusting to german customs may seem paradoxical , but that the two are not mutually exclusive .
" the turkish nation-state is a very nationalistic nation , where there are actually claims of turks belonging to the turkish nation-state even though they have been living abroad for several generations , " she told deutsche welle .
" but that does n't mean that integration on the labor market , or in the educational system , or contacts with germans - that these aspects of integration go badly . "
still , research shows that most turkish germans are poorly integrated in these areas - a fact which haci halil uslucan , director of the center for turkish studies and integration research , said can not be entirely attributed to a perceived lack of motivation of immigrants to integrate themselves .
" i think we also have to focus on the conditions of being integrated - and that means the attitudes of the majority , the look of the majority on the minority , " he told deutsche welle .
" the political discussion should not go in this direction of creating ranks - these are the good immigrants and these are the bad ones .
that only increases social tension . "
education is key bagis also said in his interview that turkish-german parents should send their children " to the best schools , so that they have a future , " echoing comments by prime minister erdogan that turkish-germans should prioritize education .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : research shows other minorities have integrated better than turks michalowski said studies of vietnamese immigrant parents in the eastern state of brandenburg have shown their children to have higher high-school graduation and college entrance rates than non-immigrant german children , partly because the parents place a high priority on education .
" some of the criticism has been that maybe turkish parents are not putting enough emphasis on getting a good education within germany , " she said .
" so if there is a government official from turkey who actually encourages people to pay more attention to the education of their children , i think that can never do any harm . "
but uslucan said other research shows that turkish-german parents have high educational aspirations for their children , and that teachers often send young turkish students to lower-level high schools that do not feed into universities , even when their educational performance is as good as their non-turkish peers .
" the doctrine must be that turkish parents should have more information about the german educational system , " he said .
" i think there is the problem that turkish parents do n't have enough information on what the best school is . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey has made entry into the eu a high priority ambassadors for turkish eu accession in addition to his post as eu affairs minister , bagis is also chiefly responsible for negotiating turkey 's accession into the bloc .
while merkel has called turkey 's accession process " open-ended with no guarantees , " the turkish government has made it a high priority .
michalowski said bagis 's call on immigrants to integrate could be seen as a way of enhancing turkey 's chances of gaining eu membership .
" if you have a well-integrated minority , people in germany may be more favorable to the idea of turkey becoming a member of the european union than if the turkish community is always in the media as being badly integrated , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 12.10.2010 asia faces a worsening water crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most rivers in bali are heavily polluted if present trends continue , the gap between demand and supply will be as high as 40 percent by 2030 , the asian development bank has warned in a new report .
inefficient water use and pollution are among the major factors . while tourists are enjoying their vacation on the white beaches and at the well-maintained hotel pools , bali 's children are playing near polluted , stinking rivers .
there is hardly any sewage treatment in indonesia .
waste water from industry , agriculture and private homes mostly pours into the nearest stream or river , without any filtering .
health problems according to estimates by the world health organization , about 50,000 people die from illnesses related to polluted water in indonesia every year .
and there are approximately 120 million cases of diarrhoea , skin diseases and other illnesses caused by contaminated water annually .
yuyun ismawati , the director of the environmental group balifokus , says : " in some areas , people are getting used to using bad water , so they kind of build up their immune system and do not get sick very easily .
but in some areas , especially for visitors and tourists , it affects their stomach and they get diarrhoea and so on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yuyun ismawati receives the goldman environmental prize waterborne diseases not only affect people ’ s health , but also have an economic fallout .
this begins at the family level , yuyun ismawati emphasizes . " children are especially affected .
and in many cases when children get diarrhoea , that also affects their parents because they can not go to work .
and most of them rely on daily wages , so they will lose their income on that day .
or if the children who suffer from diarrhoea are of school age , they lose one day 's opportunity to go to school . "
tourists use more water in bali , the group maintains , the existing water resources are only enough to support a population of 2.7 million people .
by now , the island ’ s population has grown to 3.5 million .
and that does not include the more than 4 million tourists that visit bali every year .
most of them have no idea how much water they use every day .
" not very much .
i imagine it wouldn ’ t be more than 40 liters , " says one man .
" showers are very quick - 20 to 40 liters . "
another tourist guesses wildly : " about 10 liters : take a shower , drinking – oh , no , maybe it is up to 100 liters . "
bildunterschrift : hotels in bali use 500 liters of water per day and room in fact , it is 500 liters per day and hotel room in bali ’ s tourist areas , says the ngo balifokus , which specializes in water issues and wastewater management .
the figure for tourists is much higher than for the general population , taking into account not only the water for the showers , but also for the swimming pool and the watering of the hotel garden .
paradise lost yuyun ismawati from balifokus sees trouble ahead for the fabled ' island of the gods ' : " i think in the next 20 years , we might not be recognized as a paradise island any more because paradise should not be congested , paradise should not be stinky . "
in order to save the island , balifokus is currently developing projects for sewage treatment in cooperation with the bremen overseas research and development association , or borda , from the german city of bremen .
in 2009 , balifokus ' director yuyun ismawati was awarded the goldman environmental prize for grassroots environmental action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 12.10.2010 un security council is a perennial bone of contention among nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council meets in the norwegian room in the un 's new york headquarters on paper , it ’ s the military command center and thus the most powerful body within the united nations .
but for various reasons the un security council has seldom functioned as it was intended .
history shows why . the security council , like the united nations itself , is a child of world war ii .
the decision to form the council was the centerpiece of the dumbarton oaks conference near washington in 1944 , at which the un was founded .
the idea was to create a body that , once nazi germany had been defeated , would allow the most powerful of the allied nations to act as one and prevent any similar acts of aggression .
" they were quite serious about it being a military command center , " david bosco , assistant professor of political science at american university and the author of a book on the security council , told deutsche welle .
" it was supposed to have what they called a military staff committee and countries were supposed to designate armed forces that would be used by the security council . "
by the time of the yalta conference in 1945 , the structure of institution was formalized and the five permanent members - the us , britain , france , china and the soviet union - were given the power of veto .
the so-called big three - the us , britain and the soviet union - insisted on this provision over the objections of the smaller of the 50 nations that joined the un .
the veto was intended to prevent the council from ever being used against its founding members .
but it also meant that all substantive decisions had to be unanimous , a situation that proved immediately problematic .
' no ' votes and empty seats bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the details were finalized at a meeting between churchill , roosevelt and stalin in 1945 after world war ii , with the united states and the soviet union no longer allies but rivals , the divergent interests with the council were all too apparent .
the institution was only a month old when the soviet union exercised its veto power for the first time .
in the first 10 years of its existence , the soviet union vetoed 79 resolutions .
by january 1950 , the soviets were officially boycotting the council to protest the fact that china 's seat was occupied by the republic of china -lrb- today 's taiwan -rrb- rather than the communist people 's republic , which had emerged from the chinese civil war the proceeding year .
ironically , the soviet union 's " empty seat " policy allowed the council to show for the first time that it could act effectively .
" the security council was able to do relatively little in its first couple decades of operation , " bosco said .
" the exception was the korean war when the soviets were boycotting the council .
because they were boycotting , when the korean war broke out , the united states , the united kingdom and france were able to use the security council to push through resolutions condemning the -lsb- north korean -rsb- invasion of south korea and creating a un command to respond to that aggression . "
the un sent troops to korea on september 15 , 1950 and succeeded in pushing communist troops back to the north .
an armistice , which remains in force today , was agreed in 1953 .
the end of the cold war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers , in their trademark blue helmets , were deployed most often in the 1990s american and soviet interests rarely coincided in the decades that followed , and with very few exceptions , such as the wars in the middle east in the 1960s and ' 70s , the council 's effectiveness was limited .
more often than not , as was the case with the cuban missile crisis , the institution was a stage for heated confrontations between the us and the soviet union .
that changed when mikhail gorbachev became soviet premier in 1985 .
at the time , one of the world 's most pressing security issues was the iran-iraq war .
" at a certain point , the permanent members decided to start having very quiet meetings amongst themselves to try to figure out a way to resolve that conflict , " bosco said .
the end of the cold war and the subsequent collapse of the soviet union broke through many of the ideological loggerheads and ushered in the council 's most productive period .
the council authorized un troops to drive iraqi forces from kuwait in 1990 , and the success of that operation inspired further missions .
" the activity of the council really peaks in 1993-1994 , when the council was passing dozens of resolutions - in the balkans , somalia , rwanda , just a lot of activity , " bosco explained .
" since that period there 's been a little of a retreat and some periods of lesser activity , but it 's never gone back to the -lsb- low -rsb- levels of the cold war . "
new dividing lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us secretary of state powell was unable to pursuade the council in 2003 the bolstered reputation that came with the increased effectiveness of the council took a serious knock in 2003 , when the us , unable to convince all of the permanent members to go to war against iraq , put together a " coalition of the willing " to topple iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
washington 's military-diplomatic run around the council reinforced stereotypes of the un as an impotent debating club rather than a global governing institution .
today , the us exercises its veto more often than any of the other permanent members .
the exclusive privileges of the permanent members also remain a perennial target for critics , who feel that the council 's structure no longer reflects the realities of power around the world .
some larger nations , including india , brazil and germany , have broached the idea that more permanent members should be added .
but for better or worse , the council remains the world 's premier global peacekeeping body .
and despite its inability to bring resolution to issues such as iran 's nuclear program , experts say its actions do have an effect .
" other countries are watching what 's happening with iran , watching it be isolated and its economy suffer , " bosco said .
" and they 're thinking : maybe we do n't want to go through that . "
fifty-five years on from its founding , the united nations security council still does n't function the way it was originally envisioned , but it does seem to be heading , however tentatively , in the right direction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 12.10.2010 asia faces a worsening water crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most rivers in bali are heavily polluted if present trends continue , the gap between demand and supply will be as high as 40 percent by 2030 , the asian development bank has warned in a new report .
inefficient water use and pollution are among the major factors . while tourists are enjoying their vacation on the white beaches and at the well-maintained hotel pools , bali 's children are playing near polluted , stinking rivers .
there is hardly any sewage treatment in indonesia .
waste water from industry , agriculture and private homes mostly pours into the nearest stream or river , without any filtering .
health problems according to estimates by the world health organization , about 50,000 people die from illnesses related to polluted water in indonesia every year .
and there are approximately 120 million cases of diarrhoea , skin diseases and other illnesses caused by contaminated water annually .
yuyun ismawati , the director of the environmental group balifokus , says : " in some areas , people are getting used to using bad water , so they kind of build up their immune system and do not get sick very easily .
but in some areas , especially for visitors and tourists , it affects their stomach and they get diarrhoea and so on . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yuyun ismawati receives the goldman environmental prize waterborne diseases not only affect people ’ s health , but also have an economic fallout .
this begins at the family level , yuyun ismawati emphasizes . " children are especially affected .
and in many cases when children get diarrhoea , that also affects their parents because they can not go to work .
and most of them rely on daily wages , so they will lose their income on that day .
or if the children who suffer from diarrhoea are of school age , they lose one day 's opportunity to go to school . "
tourists use more water in bali , the group maintains , the existing water resources are only enough to support a population of 2.7 million people .
by now , the island ’ s population has grown to 3.5 million .
and that does not include the more than 4 million tourists that visit bali every year .
most of them have no idea how much water they use every day .
" not very much .
i imagine it wouldn ’ t be more than 40 liters , " says one man .
" showers are very quick - 20 to 40 liters . "
another tourist guesses wildly : " about 10 liters : take a shower , drinking – oh , no , maybe it is up to 100 liters . "
bildunterschrift : hotels in bali use 500 liters of water per day and room in fact , it is 500 liters per day and hotel room in bali ’ s tourist areas , says the ngo balifokus , which specializes in water issues and wastewater management .
the figure for tourists is much higher than for the general population , taking into account not only the water for the showers , but also for the swimming pool and the watering of the hotel garden .
paradise lost yuyun ismawati from balifokus sees trouble ahead for the fabled ' island of the gods ' : " i think in the next 20 years , we might not be recognized as a paradise island any more because paradise should not be congested , paradise should not be stinky . "
in order to save the island , balifokus is currently developing projects for sewage treatment in cooperation with the bremen overseas research and development association , or borda , from the german city of bremen .
in 2009 , balifokus ' director yuyun ismawati was awarded the goldman environmental prize for grassroots environmental action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.10.2010 germany 's khedira has gone from backup to bulwark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was germany 's heart and soul against turkey as a defensive stopper , sami khedira does n't post the sort of numbers that leap out at you from score sheets .
but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 12.10.2010 militant islam gains ground in the balkans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's feared that some muslim charities could encourage wahhabism a recent online music video featuring macedonians praising osama bin laden has fueled fears that southeastern europe could be emerging as the latest breeding ground for homegrown islamist militants . it has also focused attention on muslim charities active in bosnia , kosovo , serbia , albania , macedonia and european union member bulgaria since the wars in former yugoslavia in the mid-1990s .
many of those charities are funded by oil-rich saudi arabia and propagate wahhabism - the kingdom 's austere and puritan interpretation of islam .
a majority of wahhabis favor peaceful proselytizing of islam while saudi king abdullah has been seeking to soften wahhabi practices as part of his reforms in the kingdom .
militant groups such as osama bin laden 's al-qaeda , the taliban and jihadists in somalia have however embraced significant elements of wahhabism as part of their ideology .
jasmin merdan , a young bosnian who wrote a book after disassociating himself from wahhabis groups in bosnia , warned that " they express their convictions with violence , introduce anarchy in mosques and preach intolerance . " women in the albanian city of skadar have reportedly started covering their heads or wearing the niqab , a full body covering that hides everything but the eyes , in newly found religiosity .
the video posted on youtube is one of several produced by home grown jihadists in the balkans and circulating in the region .
" oh osama , annihilate the american army .
oh osama , raise the muslims ’ honor , " a group of macedonian men chant in albanian on the video .
" in september 2001 you conquered a power .
we all pray for you . "
similar songs calling on southeastern european muslims to join the jihad have been produced in bosnian .
governments and security forces fear that that increased wahhabi activity will produce committed jihadis that could destabilize already fragile nations in southeastern europe and , in the case of bulgaria - where one sixth of the country 's 7.6 million people is muslim - produce a pool of jihadists whose eu passports would grant them easy access to western europe and allow them to blend into society . bulgaria seen as potential breeding ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most bulgarian muslims are of turkish ethnicity bulgaria is the only eu member whose muslim population are not recent immigrants .
most bulgarian muslims like those elsewhere in the balkans are descendants of ethnic turks who arrived during five centuries of ottoman rule .
three ethnic albanian brothers from macedonia were convicted to life in prison in 2008 on charges of plotting to attack the us army 's fort dix military base in new jersey .
a fourth member of the group from kosovo was sentenced to five years in jail .
across the balkans , minority wahhabi groups seek to convert mainstream islam to their more militant interpretation through the operation of cultural centers , mosques , schools and at times by battling for control of majority muslim organizations and community-owned property .
a majority of the region 's muslims are secular and analysts caution against overstating the wahhabi threat .
" it should not be ignored , but neither should it be exaggerated , " said hajrudin somun a former bosnian ambassador to turkey and history professor at sarajevo 's philip noel-baker international university .
the analysts say militant islam is gaining ground on the fringe of a more general return to religion in the balkans .
several thousand orthodox christian bulgarians demonstrated in sofia recently demanding that religious instruction be made compulsory in schools - a demand supported by mainstream muslim organizations .
muslim organizations are believed to have spent large amounts of money over the last decade to build some 150 new mosques and educational centers in predominantly orthodox bulgaria .
a minority are believed to promote wahhabism .
analysts say that radical islam has gained ground in southern and northeastern bulgaria where militant islamists , according to former bulgarian chief mufti nedim gendzhev , are seeking to create a " fundamentalist triangle " in areas of bosnia , macedonia and bulgaria 's western rhodope mountains .
fears of increasing radicalism bulgarian authorities last year arrested a mayor and a village teacher in the south of the country on charges of preaching radical islam .
in 2003 , authorities shut down several islamic centers because they were financed by saudi-funded muslim groups believed to have links to militant islamic organizations and " to prevent terrorists getting a foothold in bulgaria . "
some analysts estimate that 3,000 young muslims have graduated from militant schools still operating in bulgaria ; it was not immediately clear what they went on to do following their graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations are tense between muslims and serbs in bosnia the threat posed by the wahhabis is a major bone of contention in tense relations between muslims and serbs in bosnia , which so far has successfully neutralized wahhabi influence by controlling the appointment of imams in mosques and teachers at islamic educational institutions and employing law enforcement .
some bosnian wahhabis , estimated to number 3,000 , are former foreign fighters who married bosnian women and stayed in the country after the bosnian war that ended in 1995 .
bosnia recently stepped up its fight against militancy and organized crime to meet an eu requirement for visa-free travel for bosnians and closer ties with the bloc .
in early september , bosnian police uncovered a cache of weapons and detained a third suspect as part of their inquiry into a june bomb attack that killed one policeman and injured six others .
the attack on a police station in the town of bugojno was one of the most serious security incidents in bosnia .
police arrested the suspected mastermind and an aide shortly after the blast .
bosnia tries to crackdown on militants boris grubesic , a spokesman for the bosnian prosecutor 's office , told reporters in mid-september that prosecutors were investigating several people from bugojno and gornja maoca on suspicion of wahhabi ties , terrorism and human trafficking .
in february , bosnian and eu police raided gornja maoca and arrested seven men described as wahhabis because of their beards and shortened trousers .
police said they were detained for suspected illegal possession of arms and threatening the country 's " territorial integrity , constitutional order and provoking inter-ethnic and religious hatred . " gornja maoca was home to some 30 families who lived by strict shariah laws , organized schooling in arabic for their children outside the state system and opposed the primacy of bosnia 's mainstream islamic community .
nusret imamovic , the town 's self-proclaimed wahhabi leader , endorsed suicide attacks on the group 's bosnian language website , saying they should be launched only in " exceptional circumstances . "
the site features statements by al-qaeda and islamic groups fighting in the caucasus and celebrates suicide bombers as joyful muslims .
serbian officials say 12 alleged wahhabis convicted last year to prison terms of up to 13 years for planning terrorist attacks , including on the us embassy in belgrade , had close ties to their brethren in gornja maoca .
one of the convicted , adnan hot , said during the trial that imamovic was one of only three muslim leaders that he followed .
four other wahhabis were sentenced in a separate case to jail terms of up to eight years on charges of planning to bomb a football stadium in the southern serbian town of novi pazar .
in macedonia , suleyman rexhepim rexhepi , head of the official islamic religious community -lrb- ivz -rrb- , recently called on the government and the international community to crack down on increasingly influential wahabbi groups .
rexhepi is locked into a bitter battle with ramadan ramadani , the imam of the isa beg mosque in skopje , that has caused a rift in the country 's muslim community .
ramadani accuses rexhep of financial msmangement and is seeking his ouster .
he organized a petition signed by thousands of his followers supporting his bid for leadership of the community after rexhepi banned him from organizing prayers .
ramadani denies that wahhabis are active among macedonian muslims who account for roughly one quarter of the population as well as allegations that the pro-bin laden music video was played in mosques he controls .
a ramadani associate , radical kosovo imam sefket krasnici , shocked macedonians , when he recently denounced mother teresa , a native of skopje whom many consider a saint , during a sermon in the macedonian capital .
" she belongs in the middle of hell because she did not believe in allah , the prophet and the koran ...
even if she believed in god her belief was incomplete , with deficiencies .
god does not accept such worship , " krasnici said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 12.10.2010 germany 's khedira has gone from backup to bulwark großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sami khedira was germany 's heart and soul against turkey as a defensive stopper , sami khedira does n't post the sort of numbers that leap out at you from score sheets .
but more than any other germany squad member , he 's elevated his game to a whole new level . if you had asked sami khedira six months ago to describe his role in the german national team , he probably would have said he was just happy to be a part of it .
fast forward to october 8 , 2010 , and with bastian schweinsteiger sidelined with injury , khedira was responsible for holding together germany 's defensive midfield in an important euro 2012 qualifier against turkey .
khedira got his big break after german superstar michael ballack was hurt shortly before the 2010 world cup in south africa .
and he 's made the most of it .
ballack , as germany coach joachim loew has repeatedly made clear , will have to prove his superiority to regain his former status in the team .
the coach is full of praise for khedira .
" thus far , he 's done his job excellently , " loew said ahead of the turkey match .
" sami is the midfield player who bears the most responsibility , and i 'm absolutely satisfied with him . "
as if that were n't enough , khedira also made the jump from stuttgart to real madrid on the back of a fine world cup .
many observers predicted he 'd land straight on the bench , but real coach jose morinho has been just as impressed as loew .
" i 've been playing regularly at real , mostly over the full ninety minutes , " the 23-year-old told reporters before playing against the turks .
" and i 've been happy with my performances in the spanish championship and the champions league . "
in fact , despite initial skepticism about his abilities in the spanish media , khedira has played in all of real 's matches in those competitions .
and the fact that he soft-pedals his own success is probably part of that side of his character which so appeals to coaches .
the young veteran bildunterschrift : khedira made the move to madrid this summer together with mesut oezil some germany fans and commentators were concerned about how their team would fare against turkey - on paper their toughest group a opponents - without on-the-field leader schweinsteiger .
as it turned out , they were fine .
turkey had two decent chances but were otherwise frustrated by the iron curtain thrown up by khedira and fellow stopper toni kroos .
khedira led by example - and that 's not by accident .
" i 'm not a player who goes around talking big , " khedira said in an interview with deutsche welle .
" i 'm not a mouthpiece for the team in the sense of someone who gets loud in the changing rooms or anything like that .
i think you have to demonstrate leadership on the pitch .
you can talk as much as you want , but the truth is on the pitch . "
khedira is known for his direct , reliable game , which forgoes tricks on the ball for physical presence and a knack for good positional play .
those attributes once led the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper to dub him the " world 's youngest veteran . "
the new breed khedira is part of a new generation of germany stars who come from mixed ethnic and cultural heritage .
his father is tunisian , while his mother is german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : khedira does n't score many but his goals have been big ones but unlike many of peers , khedira never had any doubts about which national side he wanted to play for .
" to be honest it was never an issue because i was born in germany and grew up here , " khedira told deutsche welle .
" i was a part of all the german national youth teams , from the under 15s on up .
i was trained by german football coaches , and i think germany is where i feel at home . "
khedira has made a habit of repaying trust invested in him .
on october 29 , 2006 , at the age of 19 , he made his professional debut in the bundesliga .
less than seven months later , he secured the league title for his club stuttgart with a crucial game-winning header .
likewise , he made his debut in the german national team under loew in september 2009 .
ten months down the line , he scored the decisive goal in germany 's match for third place in the world cup against uruguay .
but scoring goals is n't khedira 's main task .
as long as he anchors the defensive midfield with the skill and calm he displayed against turkey , joachim loew probably would n't complain if he never found the net again for the nationalelf .
and that 's going to make it difficult for anyone , including michael ballack , to supplant him in germany 's starting eleven in the near future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de extremism -pipe- 12.10.2010 militant islam gains ground in the balkans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's feared that some muslim charities could encourage wahhabism a recent online music video featuring macedonians praising osama bin laden has fueled fears that southeastern europe could be emerging as the latest breeding ground for homegrown islamist militants . it has also focused attention on muslim charities active in bosnia , kosovo , serbia , albania , macedonia and european union member bulgaria since the wars in former yugoslavia in the mid-1990s .
many of those charities are funded by oil-rich saudi arabia and propagate wahhabism - the kingdom 's austere and puritan interpretation of islam .
a majority of wahhabis favor peaceful proselytizing of islam while saudi king abdullah has been seeking to soften wahhabi practices as part of his reforms in the kingdom .
militant groups such as osama bin laden 's al-qaeda , the taliban and jihadists in somalia have however embraced significant elements of wahhabism as part of their ideology .
jasmin merdan , a young bosnian who wrote a book after disassociating himself from wahhabis groups in bosnia , warned that " they express their convictions with violence , introduce anarchy in mosques and preach intolerance . " women in the albanian city of skadar have reportedly started covering their heads or wearing the niqab , a full body covering that hides everything but the eyes , in newly found religiosity .
the video posted on youtube is one of several produced by home grown jihadists in the balkans and circulating in the region .
" oh osama , annihilate the american army .
oh osama , raise the muslims ’ honor , " a group of macedonian men chant in albanian on the video .
" in september 2001 you conquered a power .
we all pray for you . "
similar songs calling on southeastern european muslims to join the jihad have been produced in bosnian .
governments and security forces fear that that increased wahhabi activity will produce committed jihadis that could destabilize already fragile nations in southeastern europe and , in the case of bulgaria - where one sixth of the country 's 7.6 million people is muslim - produce a pool of jihadists whose eu passports would grant them easy access to western europe and allow them to blend into society . bulgaria seen as potential breeding ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most bulgarian muslims are of turkish ethnicity bulgaria is the only eu member whose muslim population are not recent immigrants .
most bulgarian muslims like those elsewhere in the balkans are descendants of ethnic turks who arrived during five centuries of ottoman rule .
three ethnic albanian brothers from macedonia were convicted to life in prison in 2008 on charges of plotting to attack the us army 's fort dix military base in new jersey .
a fourth member of the group from kosovo was sentenced to five years in jail .
across the balkans , minority wahhabi groups seek to convert mainstream islam to their more militant interpretation through the operation of cultural centers , mosques , schools and at times by battling for control of majority muslim organizations and community-owned property .
a majority of the region 's muslims are secular and analysts caution against overstating the wahhabi threat .
" it should not be ignored , but neither should it be exaggerated , " said hajrudin somun a former bosnian ambassador to turkey and history professor at sarajevo 's philip noel-baker international university .
the analysts say militant islam is gaining ground on the fringe of a more general return to religion in the balkans .
several thousand orthodox christian bulgarians demonstrated in sofia recently demanding that religious instruction be made compulsory in schools - a demand supported by mainstream muslim organizations .
muslim organizations are believed to have spent large amounts of money over the last decade to build some 150 new mosques and educational centers in predominantly orthodox bulgaria .
a minority are believed to promote wahhabism .
analysts say that radical islam has gained ground in southern and northeastern bulgaria where militant islamists , according to former bulgarian chief mufti nedim gendzhev , are seeking to create a " fundamentalist triangle " in areas of bosnia , macedonia and bulgaria 's western rhodope mountains .
fears of increasing radicalism bulgarian authorities last year arrested a mayor and a village teacher in the south of the country on charges of preaching radical islam .
in 2003 , authorities shut down several islamic centers because they were financed by saudi-funded muslim groups believed to have links to militant islamic organizations and " to prevent terrorists getting a foothold in bulgaria . "
some analysts estimate that 3,000 young muslims have graduated from militant schools still operating in bulgaria ; it was not immediately clear what they went on to do following their graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations are tense between muslims and serbs in bosnia the threat posed by the wahhabis is a major bone of contention in tense relations between muslims and serbs in bosnia , which so far has successfully neutralized wahhabi influence by controlling the appointment of imams in mosques and teachers at islamic educational institutions and employing law enforcement .
some bosnian wahhabis , estimated to number 3,000 , are former foreign fighters who married bosnian women and stayed in the country after the bosnian war that ended in 1995 .
bosnia recently stepped up its fight against militancy and organized crime to meet an eu requirement for visa-free travel for bosnians and closer ties with the bloc .
in early september , bosnian police uncovered a cache of weapons and detained a third suspect as part of their inquiry into a june bomb attack that killed one policeman and injured six others .
the attack on a police station in the town of bugojno was one of the most serious security incidents in bosnia .
police arrested the suspected mastermind and an aide shortly after the blast .
bosnia tries to crackdown on militants boris grubesic , a spokesman for the bosnian prosecutor 's office , told reporters in mid-september that prosecutors were investigating several people from bugojno and gornja maoca on suspicion of wahhabi ties , terrorism and human trafficking .
in february , bosnian and eu police raided gornja maoca and arrested seven men described as wahhabis because of their beards and shortened trousers .
police said they were detained for suspected illegal possession of arms and threatening the country 's " territorial integrity , constitutional order and provoking inter-ethnic and religious hatred . " gornja maoca was home to some 30 families who lived by strict shariah laws , organized schooling in arabic for their children outside the state system and opposed the primacy of bosnia 's mainstream islamic community .
nusret imamovic , the town 's self-proclaimed wahhabi leader , endorsed suicide attacks on the group 's bosnian language website , saying they should be launched only in " exceptional circumstances . "
the site features statements by al-qaeda and islamic groups fighting in the caucasus and celebrates suicide bombers as joyful muslims .
serbian officials say 12 alleged wahhabis convicted last year to prison terms of up to 13 years for planning terrorist attacks , including on the us embassy in belgrade , had close ties to their brethren in gornja maoca .
one of the convicted , adnan hot , said during the trial that imamovic was one of only three muslim leaders that he followed .
four other wahhabis were sentenced in a separate case to jail terms of up to eight years on charges of planning to bomb a football stadium in the southern serbian town of novi pazar .
in macedonia , suleyman rexhepim rexhepi , head of the official islamic religious community -lrb- ivz -rrb- , recently called on the government and the international community to crack down on increasingly influential wahabbi groups .
rexhepi is locked into a bitter battle with ramadan ramadani , the imam of the isa beg mosque in skopje , that has caused a rift in the country 's muslim community .
ramadani accuses rexhep of financial msmangement and is seeking his ouster .
he organized a petition signed by thousands of his followers supporting his bid for leadership of the community after rexhepi banned him from organizing prayers .
ramadani denies that wahhabis are active among macedonian muslims who account for roughly one quarter of the population as well as allegations that the pro-bin laden music video was played in mosques he controls .
a ramadani associate , radical kosovo imam sefket krasnici , shocked macedonians , when he recently denounced mother teresa , a native of skopje whom many consider a saint , during a sermon in the macedonian capital .
" she belongs in the middle of hell because she did not believe in allah , the prophet and the koran ...
even if she believed in god her belief was incomplete , with deficiencies .
god does not accept such worship , " krasnici said .

many of those charities are funded by oil-rich saudi arabia and propagate wahhabism - the kingdom 's austere and puritan interpretation of islam .
a majority of wahhabis favor peaceful proselytizing of islam while saudi king abdullah has been seeking to soften wahhabi practices as part of his reforms in the kingdom .
militant groups such as osama bin laden 's al-qaeda , the taliban and jihadists in somalia have however embraced significant elements of wahhabism as part of their ideology .
jasmin merdan , a young bosnian who wrote a book after disassociating himself from wahhabis groups in bosnia , warned that " they express their convictions with violence , introduce anarchy in mosques and preach intolerance . " women in the albanian city of skadar have reportedly started covering their heads or wearing the niqab , a full body covering that hides everything but the eyes , in newly found religiosity .
the video posted on youtube is one of several produced by home grown jihadists in the balkans and circulating in the region .
" oh osama , annihilate the american army .
oh osama , raise the muslims ’ honor , " a group of macedonian men chant in albanian on the video .
" in september 2001 you conquered a power .
we all pray for you . "
similar songs calling on southeastern european muslims to join the jihad have been produced in bosnian .
governments and security forces fear that that increased wahhabi activity will produce committed jihadis that could destabilize already fragile nations in southeastern europe and , in the case of bulgaria - where one sixth of the country 's 7.6 million people is muslim - produce a pool of jihadists whose eu passports would grant them easy access to western europe and allow them to blend into society . bulgaria seen as potential breeding ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most bulgarian muslims are of turkish ethnicity bulgaria is the only eu member whose muslim population are not recent immigrants .
most bulgarian muslims like those elsewhere in the balkans are descendants of ethnic turks who arrived during five centuries of ottoman rule .
three ethnic albanian brothers from macedonia were convicted to life in prison in 2008 on charges of plotting to attack the us army 's fort dix military base in new jersey .
a fourth member of the group from kosovo was sentenced to five years in jail .
across the balkans , minority wahhabi groups seek to convert mainstream islam to their more militant interpretation through the operation of cultural centers , mosques , schools and at times by battling for control of majority muslim organizations and community-owned property .
a majority of the region 's muslims are secular and analysts caution against overstating the wahhabi threat .
" it should not be ignored , but neither should it be exaggerated , " said hajrudin somun a former bosnian ambassador to turkey and history professor at sarajevo 's philip noel-baker international university .
the analysts say militant islam is gaining ground on the fringe of a more general return to religion in the balkans .
several thousand orthodox christian bulgarians demonstrated in sofia recently demanding that religious instruction be made compulsory in schools - a demand supported by mainstream muslim organizations .
muslim organizations are believed to have spent large amounts of money over the last decade to build some 150 new mosques and educational centers in predominantly orthodox bulgaria .
a minority are believed to promote wahhabism .
analysts say that radical islam has gained ground in southern and northeastern bulgaria where militant islamists , according to former bulgarian chief mufti nedim gendzhev , are seeking to create a " fundamentalist triangle " in areas of bosnia , macedonia and bulgaria 's western rhodope mountains .
fears of increasing radicalism bulgarian authorities last year arrested a mayor and a village teacher in the south of the country on charges of preaching radical islam .
in 2003 , authorities shut down several islamic centers because they were financed by saudi-funded muslim groups believed to have links to militant islamic organizations and " to prevent terrorists getting a foothold in bulgaria . "
some analysts estimate that 3,000 young muslims have graduated from militant schools still operating in bulgaria ; it was not immediately clear what they went on to do following their graduation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations are tense between muslims and serbs in bosnia the threat posed by the wahhabis is a major bone of contention in tense relations between muslims and serbs in bosnia , which so far has successfully neutralized wahhabi influence by controlling the appointment of imams in mosques and teachers at islamic educational institutions and employing law enforcement .
some bosnian wahhabis , estimated to number 3,000 , are former foreign fighters who married bosnian women and stayed in the country after the bosnian war that ended in 1995 .
bosnia recently stepped up its fight against militancy and organized crime to meet an eu requirement for visa-free travel for bosnians and closer ties with the bloc .
in early september , bosnian police uncovered a cache of weapons and detained a third suspect as part of their inquiry into a june bomb attack that killed one policeman and injured six others .
the attack on a police station in the town of bugojno was one of the most serious security incidents in bosnia .
police arrested the suspected mastermind and an aide shortly after the blast .
bosnia tries to crackdown on militants boris grubesic , a spokesman for the bosnian prosecutor 's office , told reporters in mid-september that prosecutors were investigating several people from bugojno and gornja maoca on suspicion of wahhabi ties , terrorism and human trafficking .
in february , bosnian and eu police raided gornja maoca and arrested seven men described as wahhabis because of their beards and shortened trousers .
police said they were detained for suspected illegal possession of arms and threatening the country 's " territorial integrity , constitutional order and provoking inter-ethnic and religious hatred . " gornja maoca was home to some 30 families who lived by strict shariah laws , organized schooling in arabic for their children outside the state system and opposed the primacy of bosnia 's mainstream islamic community .
nusret imamovic , the town 's self-proclaimed wahhabi leader , endorsed suicide attacks on the group 's bosnian language website , saying they should be launched only in " exceptional circumstances . "
the site features statements by al-qaeda and islamic groups fighting in the caucasus and celebrates suicide bombers as joyful muslims .
serbian officials say 12 alleged wahhabis convicted last year to prison terms of up to 13 years for planning terrorist attacks , including on the us embassy in belgrade , had close ties to their brethren in gornja maoca .
one of the convicted , adnan hot , said during the trial that imamovic was one of only three muslim leaders that he followed .
four other wahhabis were sentenced in a separate case to jail terms of up to eight years on charges of planning to bomb a football stadium in the southern serbian town of novi pazar .
in macedonia , suleyman rexhepim rexhepi , head of the official islamic religious community -lrb- ivz -rrb- , recently called on the government and the international community to crack down on increasingly influential wahabbi groups .
rexhepi is locked into a bitter battle with ramadan ramadani , the imam of the isa beg mosque in skopje , that has caused a rift in the country 's muslim community .
ramadani accuses rexhep of financial msmangement and is seeking his ouster .
he organized a petition signed by thousands of his followers supporting his bid for leadership of the community after rexhepi banned him from organizing prayers .
ramadani denies that wahhabis are active among macedonian muslims who account for roughly one quarter of the population as well as allegations that the pro-bin laden music video was played in mosques he controls .
a ramadani associate , radical kosovo imam sefket krasnici , shocked macedonians , when he recently denounced mother teresa , a native of skopje whom many consider a saint , during a sermon in the macedonian capital .
" she belongs in the middle of hell because she did not believe in allah , the prophet and the koran ...
even if she believed in god her belief was incomplete , with deficiencies .
god does not accept such worship , " krasnici said .

the pupils , from king henry viii school , are concerned about possible changes to higher education funding .
the rise is likely as ministers respond to a report by lord browne , which says the current £ 3,000 cap on tuition fees should be removed .
in simple terms , it is expected to mean students having to pay a lot more for their university fees .
coventry reaction lord browne published the findings of his independent review of higher education funding and student finance on 12 october 2010 .
jason slack still urges pupils to go to university in response , the head teacher of king henry viii school , jason slack , is encouraging parents and pupils to plan well for further education , commenting : " it 's going to be a lot more expensive to send your children to university .
" i 'd still advise people to go but to prioritise financial planning .
cuts have to be made but we need to keep our university education accessible to all pupils from all backgrounds so something needs to be put in place to make it more affordable . "
anna clarke , sixth form pupil at the school , said : " if people work that hard to get the grades it is completely unfair to turn around and say but you ca n't afford the top university anyway .
it takes away any incentive to actually try if you know you ca n't go where you can get the best education . "
the pupils back the idea of a tax after graduation joseph harrison , 17 , is angry the decision-makers all benefited from free university education in their youth : " the people who are deciding this have had that step up to get into good universities .
it 's simply unfair . "
chris briggs , a parent of a sixth form pupil at the school , added her concern : " university should be fair so it 's accessible to all students and i worry what they 're going to come up with .
" university gives you huge life skills and independence and you learn so much about yourself .
i 'd be very sad if some students could n't partake in that because of the financial aspect . "
spending cuts students have published pictures of nick clegg pledging to oppose fee rises the government has indicated that it will not protect higher education from spending cuts and university leaders warn of a future reduction in student numbers either because fees increase or because government funding is reduced .
lord browne 's proposal of a free market in fees could allow universities in england to charge up to £ 12,000 per year for a degree course .

the years which followed saw protracted conflicts culminating in independence for algeria and most other french colonies in africa as well as decolonisation in south-east asia .
overview overview facts leaders media france was one of the founding fathers of european integration as the continent sought to rebuild after the devastation of world war ii .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
in the 1990s franco-german cooperation was central to european economic integration .
the bond between the two countries was again to the fore in the new millennium when their leaders voiced strong opposition as the us-led campaign in iraq began .
but france sent shockwaves through european union capitals when its voters rejected the proposed eu constitution in a referendum in may 2005 .
france 's colonial past is a major contributing factor in the presence of a richly diverse multicultural population .
it is home to more than five million people of arab and african descent .
a french icon for the 21st century : the millau bridge in massif central it has a number of territories overseas which , together with mainland france and corsica , go to make up the 26 regions which the country comprises .
it is further divided into 100 departements , four of which - french guiana , guadeloupe , martinique and réunion - are geographically distant from europe .
government in france is known for its high degree of centralisation but in march 2003 parliament approved amendments to the constitution allowing for the devolution of quite wide-ranging powers to the regions and departements .
in the light of low election turnout , the move was widely seen as a bid to re-engage in the political process french people disillusioned by the ubiquitous influence of what is often perceived as the paris elite .
france has produced some of the continent 's most influential writers and thinkers from descartes and pascal in the 17th century , through rousseau and voltaire in the 18th , baudelaire and flaubert in the 19th to sartre and camus in the 20th .
in the last two centuries it has given the art world the works of renoir , monet , cezanne , gauguin , matisse and braque , to name but a few .
it is also famous for its strong culinary tradition .
france produces more than 250 cheeses and some of the world 's best-loved wines .

nicolas sarkozy has acquired a reputation for plain speaking profile : nicolas sarkozy sarkozy 's media management testing days for sarkozy he cast himself as a moderniser and claimed to represent a clean break with the country 's traditional ruling elite .
his first cabinet had a definite new look , with more female ministers than previous french governments .
he had fought his election campaign on a promise to introduce pro-market reforms to tackle sluggish economic growth and high unemployment .
he vowed to cut taxes , rein in powerful trades unions and reduce public spending .
the implementation of mr sarkozy 's policies was bound to hit public sector workers hard , and since he assumed the presidency there have been regular public sector strikes in protest at planned cuts to pay and pension benefits .
on foreign policy , mr sarkozy has singled out france 's role in europe as a priority .
he campaigned vigorously for ratification of the lisbon treaty , which was intended to replace the draft eu constitution rejected by french voters in 2005 .
he has also taken a lead in calling for fundamental reform of the world 's financial system in response to the global credit crunch .
he is seen as being more pro-american than previous french presidents .
he cultivated close ties with us president george w. bush and has made no secret of his admiration for bush 's successor , barack obama .
tough domestic challenges - by the spring of 2010 , unemployment was running at more than 10 % - led to the french people becoming disillusioned with mr sarkozy 's leadership , and in march of that year his party suffered a bruising defeat in regional elections .
his popularity was further damaged by allegations that his election campaign had been partly funded by illegal donations from france 's richest woman , the l 'oreal heiress liliane bettencourt .
nicolas sarkozy , who was 52 when he was elected , is the son of a hungarian immigrant and a french mother of greek jewish origin .
he grew up in paris .
thrice married , currently to singer carla bruni , he has three children .
his predecessor , jacques chirac , had held office since 1995 .
french presidents are elected to five-year terms after a constitutional change in 2002 reduced the term from seven years .
a candidate can win in one round if he or she secures an absolute majority .
otherwise , the top two candidates go through to a second round .
the president , who exercises executive power , appoints a council of ministers headed by the prime minister .
prime minister : francois fillon francois fillon , a confidante of the president francois fillon worked closely with nicolas sarkozy during the presidential election campaign .
upon taking office , he promised to carry out the president 's reform programme and to secure an " eminent " place for france in the 21st century .
as a minister under president chirac he overhauled the pension system .
he is seen as a moderate within the ump and is accustomed to negotiating with france 's powerful trades unions .

over 200,000 people attempt to climb the mountain every year .
the area is a site of special scientific interest -lrb- sssi -rrb- and a special area for conservation -lrb- sac -rrb- .
the mountain is under the guardianship of the john muir trust .
volunteers from the trust carry out work parties clearing litter from ben nevis each year .
the last rubbish-clearing work party for 2010 took place on 2 october with nine sacks of rubbish being removed with litter ranging from banana skins to plastic bags .
the trust collects litter from the summit of ben nevis four times a year while the summit is free from snow .
in pictures : ben nevis as well as removing rubbish , the trust maintains the mountain path and monitors biodiversity in the area .
the trust held its first work party on ben nevis in 2001 , after purchasing the land in 2000 .
work parties are also organised on other properties owned by the trust or where a landowner partnership exists .
publicity stunt as the highest mountain in britain , ben nevis has been the focus of stunts and events not always in keeping with the natural wilderness .
ken campbell sent in this photo of his grandfather in 1911 edinburgh motorist , henry alexander , drove a model t ford up the mountain as a publicity stunt for his company .
ken campbell sent in a photo of his grandfather , james inglis , who served as an apprentice with the company at the time .
inglis can be seen in the back of the car with alexander and another man in the front .
according to ken this was photographed as part of the publicity for the ben nevis trip .
' big impact ' the remains of a piano were found on the mountain in 2006 by volunteers from the john muir trust .
the piano was carried up ben nevis in 1986 by a group of dundee removal men as a charity fund-raising exercise .
keeping the mountain free from rubbish can be an uphill struggle but some veterans return to the same property year after year , with men and women of all ages taking part in the work parties .
sandy maxwell , work party coordinator said : " ben nevis is one of the most popular hills in the uk , with 200,000 people climbing every year .
it 's great that so many people are taking to the hills but clearly a small minority are irresponsible and leave their litter behind . "
" if visitors to the ben took away at least one piece of other people 's litter when they climb the mountain it would have a big impact , and we would be able to concentrate our efforts on other things . "

advertisement joan rivers comes to sheffield doc / fest 2010 by owen anthony bbc sheffield and south yorkshire contributor comedienne , joan rivers , will be at the opening of doc / fest october has been the month of festivals in sheffield - with a comedy festival , a literary festival and a horror film festival all vying for your spare time .
if you 're concerned that , in comparison , november is looking remarkably free of festivals then fear not - doc / fest is back from 3-7 november .
this is the 17th year of doc / fest and over the last few years it has rapidly expanded to become the biggest documentary festival in the uk .
last year had a wealth of films including the high profile uk premiere of michael moore 's ' capitalism : a love story ' , followed by a satellite linked q & a session with the oscar winning director and ' moving to mars ' , a documentary following two burmese families who had been relocated to sheffield .
this year 's festival plans to pick up and run with the gauntlet thrown down last year .
the festival opens with ' joan rivers : the making of a piece of work ' , the uk premiere of award-winning filmmakers ricki stern and annie sundberg .
the film follows the comedienne and pop icon joan rivers over the course of a year .
joan rivers will be attending doc / fest and holding a q & a session afterwards , which is likely to be a no-holds-barred event if her stand-up style is anything to go by .

once the first film kicks the doors open the festival programme reveals a rush of films and events piling through behind it .
with a 132 strong line-up of features , shorts , student and cross-platform docs from 26 countries - including 17 world premieres , 26 uk premieres , five european premieres and one international premiere wedged into five days - there will be some spinning heads , bleary eyes and numb posteriors for anyone trying to get a serious number of documentaries under their belt .
however , what makes a film festival truly a film festival and not just a bunch of films put on by some enthusiasts are the activities and events staged around the screenings .
masterclasses from film makers , awards ceremonies , q & a sessions and thousands of industry insiders descending to scout , view , review and commission add to the hubbub .
expect to see lots of people with badges dangling round their necks walking quickly between screenings shouting into mobile phones .
last year we followed an aspiring filmmaker from sheffield , alice carder , who successfully pitched an idea at doc / fest that ended up as a film that was broadcast on bbc 3 this summer .
who knows what might come out of this year 's meetings for those of us not on the cutting edge of moving and shaking deals , who just want to see some interesting films , the programme is available at the showroom cinema or on the sheffield doc / fest website .
rolf 's life and work are the subject of vikram jayanti 's film the programme is split thematically into groups including : doc / uk ; a special focus on the middle east including works from lebanon , palestine , turkey , israel , iran and tunisia ; a career retrospective and masterclass from india 's renowned documentary filmmaker anand patwardhan featuring four feature films curated by mark cousins ; doc / international ; arts docs ; bent docs ; cross platform docs ; first cut ; music docs ; scottish documentary institute and shorts .
having taken my highlighter pen to the timetable , here are a few films i plan to see based on nothing other than a good reputation or an interesting write up : • in etienne sauret 's ' dirty pictures ' we meet alexander sasha shulgin who synthesized the drug mdma in the 1960s and has devoted his -lrb- and his wife 's -rrb- lives to tinkering with mind-altering drugs ever since . • in ' the miscreants of taliwood ' from veteran australian director george gittoes , he travels once more to a war zone in search of art and culture , to peshawar in pakistan 's northwest frontier .
he launches himself into the local film industry -lrb- cheesy overblown films which make bollywood look tame -rrb- and self-funds two dramas which take him and his frightened crew into the mountains were bin laden apparently lurks . • sundance hit ' catfish ' is a dark and wildly weird look at the alternate side to the social media phenomenon . • in ' vapour trail ' john gianvito gives uncensored voice to filipinos living with contamination left around abandoned us airbases . • award-winning director vikram jayanti follows 80 year old rolf harris ' latest work-in-progress in ' arena : rolf harris paints his dream ' . • in ' jean-michel basquiat : the radiant child ' tamra davis portrays one of the most enigmatic and accomplished artists of the 1980s , who died aged 27 .
combining a rare and remarkably candid interview filmed at the height of his fame together with archive and input from many of basquiat 's admirers , including julian schnabel , and fab 5 freddy .
playwright alan bennett is the subject of a documentary by adam low • adam low 's multi-layered ' alan bennett and the habit of art ' looks at the collaboration between bennett and nicholas hytner . • yony leyser 's ' william s burroughs - a man within ' features footage of burroughs and exclusive interviews with some of his closest friends including john waters , david cronenberg , iggy pop , peter weller , anne waldman and many others . • ' now as it was then - heaven 17 the story of penthouse & pavement ' , directed by james strong , is the story of how sheffield pop icons heaven 17 recorded their debut lp against a backdrop of economic hardship and social division . • stig björkman 's ' but film is my mistress ' takes us behind the scenes of eight ingmar bergman films and includes interviews with liv ullman , martin scorsese , woody allen and lars von trier . • four minutes of werner herzog 's powerful and equivocal fusion of film and opera ' la bohème ' featuring incredible imagery of the mursi people of south-west ethiopa and puccini 's love duet ' o soave fanciulla ' -lrb- oh gentle angel -rrb- from la bohème .

but it did - for 50 years so far and counting .
john burrell , from south shields , met brenda at the cinema - ten months later she was pregnant .
john 's mum did n't like her , brenda 's mum did n't like him - fearing the worst they ran away to scotland to get married .
half a century later those teenagers are celebrating their golden wedding anniversary .
brenda remembers : " when i found out i was pregnant we just sat and i says , ' me dad 'll kill us , we 'll be dead , should we run away ? "
john bought her a ring at woolworths for 2d and off they went .
the ring turned brenda 's fingers green and she had to keep polishing it so people would n't know it was from woolworth 's until john could afford to buy her a new one .
she need n't have bothered - no-one believed they were married anyway .
she says : " we did n't know where we were running , you know .
we just got to newcastle , got on a train and got off at glasgow . "
missing gretna in scotland couples can get married at 16 without parental consent they had half intended to get off at gretna green - the haven for all 16-18 year olds who would need parental permission in england - but somehow ended up a little further north .
both admit they did n't really know where they were going or what they were going to do .
they arrived in glasgow with £ 20 between them and soon discovered they needed to be resident for 21 days before they could get married - not the three days they had thought .
those three weeks were n't the nicest precursor to married life , as brenda recalls : " there was this old lady on the corner of the street , i think she was a lady of the night , and we asked if there was anywhere to go .
" we 're in the gorbals and -lsb- she -rsb- took us to these tenements , she got us this room and , when we got in the room , it was horrible .
" it was a brothel .
all the ladies of the night went in it .
we were terrified at night coz you could hear all the shouting and the fighting . "
tramp witnesses that train to scotland started a journey that 's lasted 50 years ... so far their money did n't go far , they were nearly starving and brenda - pregnant - kept collapsing .
john tried to provide , brenda says : " he used to go round the shops and used to say , ' i 'll get us something ' , and i said , ' no the police 'll get us then we 'll get locked up ' . "
back home the police were indeed involved - and the papers .
everyone thought they must be in gretna green so john and brenda 's disorganisation proved to be , as brenda puts it , a godsend .
the wedding was at martha street register office with two " scruffy " tramps off the street as witnesses .
now - fifty years , three children , four grandchildren and two great grandchildren later - they 've proved wrong those who said it would never last .
brenda says : " we do argue .
i 'm the bad tempered one , not him .
" we never , ever go to bed without speaking .
never , ever have we gone to bed without speaking . "

the developments will be officially unveiled on 30 october , when the high street will be reopened to traffic .
the work is part of multi-million pound regeneration plans for dawley and malinslee .
the project also includes new housing , retail , and a £ 20 million sports and learning community to replace the existing phoenix school .
project officer james dunn said the plans included a supermarket : " the idea is to retain as many people in dawley , so they spend money on their food retail in dawley and then ... spend more money on the high street . "
the biggest investment is a replacement for the phoenix school , parts of which date back to the 1950s .
work on the new school on paddock mount is not due to be completed until 2013 , but the plans have already excited teachers and pupils alike .
work at the paddock mount site has involved treating old mine shafts head teacher neil stonehouse said facilities at the new school would be " state-of-the-art " and represented " an amazing opportunity for the school ... and the wider community " .
mr stonehouse said the local community would be able to use the resources at the new school , including access to sports and leisure facilities .
the head teacher also said pupils would benefit from new technology : " i expect that all students will be able to have access to ict -lrb- information and communications technology -rrb- at any part of the school ... and that they 'd be able to use handheld devices within their learning .
" learning is changing and the new school will have facilities that will allow for personalised learning and independent learning , rather than just classrooms that sit 30 people . "
the dawley regeneration is part of telford and wrekin council 's borough towns initiative , launched in 2006 .
the project included plans for randlay , dawley , madeley , wellington madeley , sutton hill and leegomery .
