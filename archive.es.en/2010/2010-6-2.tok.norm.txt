among them were at least 11 germans , one of whom was injured during the raid . israeli officials on wednesday said that all detainees from the gaza aid flotilla had been released and were being deported .
some have been bussed to the border with jordan , while most have been brought to tel aviv 's ben gurion airport .
according to israeli foreign ministry spokesman jigdal palmor , the majority of the activists have already returned to their home countries .
of the 11 germans , five have arrived back home .
of the six still waiting to be cleared for flights , one had to be treated for injuries at a hospital near the airport .
the activists on board the ships claimed to be part of a humanitarian mission to gaza and were being held in israel for questioning about the incident .

" this has been a clear act of piracy , " he angrily told reporters .
" i 'm anxious to hear what the german government and parliament have to say about this act of piracy , which if it had occurred near somalia would be treated as such . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle has criticised the israeli raid while german chancellor angela merkel has called for a lifting of the blockade of gaza . also on board were matthias jochheim , a german representative of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war ; inge hoeger and annette groth , current left party members of parliament ; and nadel el sakka , a representative of the palestinian community in germany .
bildunterschrift : among those detained onboard the aid flotilla were least 38 different nationalities , many of them turks but also israelis , palestinians and more than a hundred europeans .
hoeger , one of the two members of parliament , said the women on the ship were quickly shut in a lower level of the ship , the so-called ' women 's deck , ' during the night .
" we could n't get out , we did n't know what was going on above because we were locked in , " she said .
" we put on our life vests and eventually we figured out that the ship was occupied , that the israelis had taken it over . "
hoeger and her colleague groth said they did not know who had shut them in - the organizers of the flotilla or the israelis .
after they were let out they were searched , handcuffed and brought to the port in the israeli city of ashdod .
there they were allowed to contact the german embassy , she said .
" this is against any kind of international law , just like the blockade of gaza is against international law , " she said .
" and through our actions we wanted to make it known that this is illegal . "
netanyahu dismisses un criticism israel says it has processed activists of at least 38 different nationalities , many of them turks but also israelis , palestinians and more than a hundred europeans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel prime minister netanyahu accused international critics of " hypocrisy " the united nations ' human rights council has meanwhile condemned israel for the attack on the flotilla .
the 47-member body on wednesday passed a resolution to establish a fact-finding mission into possible violations of international law .
tel aviv has refused to cooperate with previous probes ordered by the council .
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on monday defended the seizure of the aid flotilla , accusing critics of " hypocrisy " .
in a televised address to the nation , he said he would continue to blockade the hamas-run gaza strip , arguing that lifting the embargo would turn the palestinian enclave into a base of iranian missiles. ai / reuters / ap / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 02.06.2010 european commission plans reform of rating agency regulation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies are blamed for worsening the financial crisis credit rating agencies in the european union could soon be subject to new operating regulations , but some analysts fear that too much regulation will stifle competition in an sector already under a virtual oligopoly . the european commission on wednesday unveiled new proposals for regulating credit rating agencies -lrb- cras -rrb- , which some analysts blame for exacerbating the turmoil in european financial markets .
the new guidelines provide stricter transparency guidelines , and place cra regulation under the authority of the european securities and markets authority -lrb- esma -rrb- , which the commission established last year and is due to come into force at the start of 2011 .
the esma would have the authority to impose sanctions on agencies , and even withdraw their licenses when they fail to comply with regulations .
the three main credit rating agencies , standard & poor 's , moody 's and fitch , had operated with significant latitude before the eu began issuing licenses and demanding a certain level of transparency just last year , according to karel lannoo , director of the european credit research institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lowered bond ratings have made it hard for greece to finance its budget " when the financial crisis started in 2007 , it was very clear that the ratings which the rating agencies gave were not based on pure objective facts , " he told deutsche welle .
" there were huge conflicts of interest .
that 's why the eu was then convinced that there should be a piece of regulation . "
case for regulation one function of rating agencies is to rate the risk of government bonds , using a scale of aaa for the most secure to d for an almost certain default .
the agencies then sell these ratings to investors and banks .
the conflict of interest appears when the agencies rate the very institutions that buy their services , said robert halver , stock analyst for baader bank .
" the rating agencies finance themselves very strongly with the sale of analytical instruments on pension funds , insurance agencies and banks , because everyone assumes that they have a lot of knowledge about country 's risks , " he told deutsche welle .
another reason for further regulation is the role cras have played in crises related to the public finance of budgets , most notably in greece but also in spain , portugal and italy , said lannoo .
when ratings agencies devalue government bonds , it creates a problem of " systemic stability . "
" all of a sudden these ratings agencies have drastically downgraded the debt of these countries , which as given rise to systemic effects , in the sense that many investors have started to sell the securities or the bonds of these countries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker has proposed a new cra close to the european central bank more competition halver said one solution to europe 's problem with cras would be the creation of a european rating agency to compete with the " big three , " as long as it was n't under the supervision of a public entity like the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- or the european commission , as eurogroup president jean-claude juncker recently suggested .
" then there would be suspicion that they would exercise their influence and try to sugarcoat negative evaluations , " he said .
" that can not happen . "
lannoo said the big three already have a european component in fitch , whose main shareholder is european .
rather than constructing a new european rating agency , he said regulators should instead make it easier for already-existing agencies to be licensed as cras .
" what in fact we need to do is ... to lower the entry barriers into the sector , " he said .
" but what we in fact have done with this european regulation now is just the opposite - we have increased the entry thresholds because it 's extremely difficult to be in line with this piece of regulation . "

much of the action during monday 's pre-dawn raid by israeli commandos was focused on a turkish-flagged ship and at least four of the nine fatalities arising from the attack were pro-palestinian turks . in the days following , relations between turkey and israel have been strained to breaking point with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan calling the raid a " bloody massacre " and accusing israel of " unacceptable lawlessness . " erdogan has even gone so far as to refer to israel - a close partner since diplomatic ties with the jewish state were established in 1949 - as " a festering boil in the middle east that spreads hate and enmity , dynamites regional peace and spreads instability . " in such a situation , it is unsurprising that relations between turkey and israel are currently plummeting to an all-time low , even lower than when the relationship soured over israel 's military operations in gaza in 2008 .
but experts are also watching closely how relations between turkey and israel 's most powerful ally – the united states – will develop as the shockwaves from the flotilla raid ripple on . a furious erdogan wasted no time calling us president barack obama after the incident . " israel is faced with the danger of losing its sole friend in the region and the greatest contributor so far to regional peace , " erdogan told the us president in a one-hour telephone conversation , according to a turkish government statement on wednesday . bildunterschrift : erdogan suggested that turkey could abandon israel but trade and military ties remain too strong turkey-israel ties ' too strong to break ' turkey has been israel 's chief regional ally since a military cooperation deal was signed between the two countries in 1996 .
however , some sections of the us media claim the implication behind erdogan 's statement is that turkey , with its mainly muslim population , could shift its allegiance towards its new-found friends in the arab world , partners which the islamist-rooted government in ankara have been courting for some time . joost lagendijk , a senior advisor at the istanbul policy center , disagrees .
he believes that the connections between turkey and israel are too strong to be severed . " while we will see the two sides divided at an official , political level , turkey and israel will still have strong military and business ties , " he told deutsche welle . " it makes good sense to have good relations with the arabs but rejecting israel for the arabs is not a viable alternative . " while relations – especially those concerning trade – have been improving over the past few years with a host of arab nations , including syria , iran , lebanon and jordan , turkey still has its eyes set on europe and eu membership .
the european union is still the main power that turkey trusts most in the international arena , despite the eu 's continued ambivalence towards ankara 's accession hopes . however , some observers claim that the israeli raid offers turkey an opportunity to dangle the possibility of an eastward shift in the face of the united states to gain some leverage in a number of issues .
joost lagendijk believes it would be foolish to do so . " turkey 's standing in the middle east and its dealing with its arab partners are only possible because it has such good connections with both the us and the eu , ” he said .
“ that 's what makes turkey such an interesting partner to the arabs .
what would the value of turkey be without that ? " steven cook , a middle east expert at the council on foreign relations , believes turkey will pursue its own goals in the middle east and wo n't feel the need to pressure the us into supporting it . " turkey has economic , political and strategic interests in the arab middle east and turkish leaders obviously feel less inhibited to pursue their own interests in the region , regardless of washington 's wishes , " he told deutsche welle .
" the turks are willing to bend the regional rules of the game to serve ankara 's own interests .
if the resulting policies serve us goals at the same time , all well and good .
if not , so be it . " the united states may be closely watching turkey 's growing connection to regional arab powers but is unlikely to feel any threat from its closer ties with the likes of iran and syria .
despite its ambitions , turkey 's current economic and strategic power is still not enough to project discernible influence in the middle east and it still requires good relations with the us and eu to add weight to its status in the region . us looking to keep muslim ally turkey on side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain good relations with turkey bilateral relations by their nature have mutual benefits and turkey is n't the only partner seeking support .
the united states sees turkey as a key muslim ally and the obama administration has been working hard to repair the damage to relations caused by the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion . since then , the us and turkey have set-up intelligence sharing networks in the on-going fight against international terrorism while turkey hosts the us military infrastructure needed for its missions in neighbouring iraq and afghanistan . " turkey is still a key muslim ally to the us and is a favorite partner , one which is held up as an example of a predominantly islamic country with a growing democracy , " joost lagendijk said .
" the us wo n't want to jeapordise that .
if it turns on turkey for any reason , then the whole rhetoric washington has created about reforming the islamic world will crumble . " despite this , steven cook says , the two nations are increasingly finding themselves at odds with each other . " washington and ankara do share the same goals : peace between israel and the palestinians ; a stable , unified iraq ; an iran without nuclear weapons ; stability in afghanistan ; and a western-oriented syria , " he said . " when you get down to details , however , washington and ankara are on the opposite ends of virtually all these issues . " but after six decades of strategic cooperation , the stark reality is that while turkey and the united states are not enemies in the middle east , they are fast becoming strategic competitors . " turkey is asserting itself more in the middle east , where it has gone from a tepid observer to an influential player in eight short years , " cook added . washington faces balancing act with ankara , jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ties with israel will impact on its relations with turkey while turkey and the united states will not want to fall out , the situation arising from the israeli flotilla raid may still give turkey an opportunity to press its own agenda while maintaining strong ties with the us .
as pressure from the international community grows , turkey currently stands a greater chance at getting its own way over ending the blockade of gaza " the world has woken up to the gaza situation and now it is not only turkey calling for the end of the blockade , ” lagendijk said .
“ turkey , if it is clever , can use this to pressure the us which itself is growing more frustrated with the netanyahu government in israel .
maybe this will lead to the us calling for an end to the embargo . " author : nick amies editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey has attempted to play mediator in middle east , but that was before an israeli military attack on a turkish aid ship .
ankara is playing with fire , says baha guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . the whole world knows that israel is not squeamish about enforcing its interests .
and in light of the latest attacks on gaza , it is a fact that israel will not hesitate violating human rights under the pretext of self-defense and attacking people with brute military force without regard for civilian casualties .
the question must be asked : what was the purpose of the actions of this independent turkish aid organization ?
the officially stated goals were not achieved ; the flotilla could neither break the israeli naval blockade nor bring relief supplies directly to gaza .
for weeks , israel had communicated to turkey through all available diplomatic channels that such aid action would , if necessary , be stopped with violence .
israel made good on its threats and boarded the largest ship of the maritime aid convoy , contravening international maritime law .
in the process there was a shoot-out : at least nine people died and dozens more were injured .
and now , the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan rages unchecked against israel and is playing a dangerous game .
turkey has been a nato member for almost 60 years .
as an ally in the western defense alliance , turkey has a peace obligation .
recent turkish diplomacy has succeeded in smoothing the tensions between iran and the west and mediating between syria and israel while remaining credible in the process .
but with this week 's incident , turkey has reduced itself to just another member of the anti-israel front in the middle east .
at the very least , turkey 's credibility regarding future mediation is put in doubt .
the turkish ship was decorated with giant turkish and palestinian flags .
the image of the incident was that israeli soldiers captured a turkish ship .
in turkey , tens of thousands of demonstrators were mobilized and laid siege to israel 's diplomatic missions .
prime minister erdogan raged on against israel , speaking of " state terrorism , " a " regime of lies " and arguing that israel must now be " punished . "
according to erdogan , whoever chooses to ignore the atrocities of israel makes himself " complicit in the crime against humanity . "
the arduous international efforts to achieve a lasting peace in the middle east are important to turkey , as is the peace process in the caucasus or the balkans .
therefore , they should not be harnessed to the cart of discordant states in the middle east that lack basic democratic structures . there are very few , barely audible voices in turkey that warn against a further verbal escalation .
in europe , the erdogan 's arguments fall on stunned ears .
although he condemns anti-semitism and promises the jewish community in his country security , the waves of anti-israeli hatred have reached turkey .
one of the few sensible voices in europe came from ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign committee of the german bundestag .
he called , contrary to the stance of germany 's christian democrats , for attempts to further motivate turkey towards eu membership rather than to reject it on religious and cultural grounds . it 's easy to see which camp turkey will fall into if its bid for eu membership fails . the eu would be acting in their own foreign policy interests by keeping turkey on the membership track .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 02.06.2010 turkey and us face tough decisions on relations after israeli flotilla raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as turkey 's relations with israel dive , ankara looks to the us while its relations with israel continue to plummet to new depths in the wake of the gaza flotilla raid , turkey is considering how to handle the us as washington tries to balance its ties with jerusalem and ankara . few countries are more enraged by israel 's raid on the gaza aid flotilla than turkey .
much of the action during monday 's pre-dawn raid by israeli commandos was focused on a turkish-flagged ship and at least four of the nine fatalities arising from the attack were pro-palestinian turks . in the days following , relations between turkey and israel have been strained to breaking point with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan calling the raid a " bloody massacre " and accusing israel of " unacceptable lawlessness . " erdogan has even gone so far as to refer to israel - a close partner since diplomatic ties with the jewish state were established in 1949 - as " a festering boil in the middle east that spreads hate and enmity , dynamites regional peace and spreads instability . " in such a situation , it is unsurprising that relations between turkey and israel are currently plummeting to an all-time low , even lower than when the relationship soured over israel 's military operations in gaza in 2008 .
but experts are also watching closely how relations between turkey and israel 's most powerful ally – the united states – will develop as the shockwaves from the flotilla raid ripple on . a furious erdogan wasted no time calling us president barack obama after the incident . " israel is faced with the danger of losing its sole friend in the region and the greatest contributor so far to regional peace , " erdogan told the us president in a one-hour telephone conversation , according to a turkish government statement on wednesday . bildunterschrift : erdogan suggested that turkey could abandon israel but trade and military ties remain too strong turkey-israel ties ' too strong to break ' turkey has been israel 's chief regional ally since a military cooperation deal was signed between the two countries in 1996 .
however , some sections of the us media claim the implication behind erdogan 's statement is that turkey , with its mainly muslim population , could shift its allegiance towards its new-found friends in the arab world , partners which the islamist-rooted government in ankara have been courting for some time . joost lagendijk , a senior advisor at the istanbul policy center , disagrees .
he believes that the connections between turkey and israel are too strong to be severed . " while we will see the two sides divided at an official , political level , turkey and israel will still have strong military and business ties , " he told deutsche welle . " it makes good sense to have good relations with the arabs but rejecting israel for the arabs is not a viable alternative . " while relations – especially those concerning trade – have been improving over the past few years with a host of arab nations , including syria , iran , lebanon and jordan , turkey still has its eyes set on europe and eu membership .
the european union is still the main power that turkey trusts most in the international arena , despite the eu 's continued ambivalence towards ankara 's accession hopes . however , some observers claim that the israeli raid offers turkey an opportunity to dangle the possibility of an eastward shift in the face of the united states to gain some leverage in a number of issues .
joost lagendijk believes it would be foolish to do so . " turkey 's standing in the middle east and its dealing with its arab partners are only possible because it has such good connections with both the us and the eu , ” he said .
“ that 's what makes turkey such an interesting partner to the arabs .
what would the value of turkey be without that ? " steven cook , a middle east expert at the council on foreign relations , believes turkey will pursue its own goals in the middle east and wo n't feel the need to pressure the us into supporting it . " turkey has economic , political and strategic interests in the arab middle east and turkish leaders obviously feel less inhibited to pursue their own interests in the region , regardless of washington 's wishes , " he told deutsche welle .
" the turks are willing to bend the regional rules of the game to serve ankara 's own interests .
if the resulting policies serve us goals at the same time , all well and good .
if not , so be it . " the united states may be closely watching turkey 's growing connection to regional arab powers but is unlikely to feel any threat from its closer ties with the likes of iran and syria .
despite its ambitions , turkey 's current economic and strategic power is still not enough to project discernible influence in the middle east and it still requires good relations with the us and eu to add weight to its status in the region . us looking to keep muslim ally turkey on side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain good relations with turkey bilateral relations by their nature have mutual benefits and turkey is n't the only partner seeking support .
the united states sees turkey as a key muslim ally and the obama administration has been working hard to repair the damage to relations caused by the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion . since then , the us and turkey have set-up intelligence sharing networks in the on-going fight against international terrorism while turkey hosts the us military infrastructure needed for its missions in neighbouring iraq and afghanistan . " turkey is still a key muslim ally to the us and is a favorite partner , one which is held up as an example of a predominantly islamic country with a growing democracy , " joost lagendijk said .
" the us wo n't want to jeapordise that .
if it turns on turkey for any reason , then the whole rhetoric washington has created about reforming the islamic world will crumble . " despite this , steven cook says , the two nations are increasingly finding themselves at odds with each other . " washington and ankara do share the same goals : peace between israel and the palestinians ; a stable , unified iraq ; an iran without nuclear weapons ; stability in afghanistan ; and a western-oriented syria , " he said . " when you get down to details , however , washington and ankara are on the opposite ends of virtually all these issues . " but after six decades of strategic cooperation , the stark reality is that while turkey and the united states are not enemies in the middle east , they are fast becoming strategic competitors . " turkey is asserting itself more in the middle east , where it has gone from a tepid observer to an influential player in eight short years , " cook added . washington faces balancing act with ankara , jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ties with israel will impact on its relations with turkey while turkey and the united states will not want to fall out , the situation arising from the israeli flotilla raid may still give turkey an opportunity to press its own agenda while maintaining strong ties with the us .
as pressure from the international community grows , turkey currently stands a greater chance at getting its own way over ending the blockade of gaza " the world has woken up to the gaza situation and now it is not only turkey calling for the end of the blockade , ” lagendijk said .
“ turkey , if it is clever , can use this to pressure the us which itself is growing more frustrated with the netanyahu government in israel .
maybe this will lead to the us calling for an end to the embargo . " author : nick amies editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey has attempted to play mediator in middle east , but that was before an israeli military attack on a turkish aid ship .
ankara is playing with fire , says baha guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . the whole world knows that israel is not squeamish about enforcing its interests .
and in light of the latest attacks on gaza , it is a fact that israel will not hesitate violating human rights under the pretext of self-defense and attacking people with brute military force without regard for civilian casualties .
the question must be asked : what was the purpose of the actions of this independent turkish aid organization ?
the officially stated goals were not achieved ; the flotilla could neither break the israeli naval blockade nor bring relief supplies directly to gaza .
for weeks , israel had communicated to turkey through all available diplomatic channels that such aid action would , if necessary , be stopped with violence .
israel made good on its threats and boarded the largest ship of the maritime aid convoy , contravening international maritime law .
in the process there was a shoot-out : at least nine people died and dozens more were injured .
and now , the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan rages unchecked against israel and is playing a dangerous game .
turkey has been a nato member for almost 60 years .
as an ally in the western defense alliance , turkey has a peace obligation .
recent turkish diplomacy has succeeded in smoothing the tensions between iran and the west and mediating between syria and israel while remaining credible in the process .
but with this week 's incident , turkey has reduced itself to just another member of the anti-israel front in the middle east .
at the very least , turkey 's credibility regarding future mediation is put in doubt .
the turkish ship was decorated with giant turkish and palestinian flags .
the image of the incident was that israeli soldiers captured a turkish ship .
in turkey , tens of thousands of demonstrators were mobilized and laid siege to israel 's diplomatic missions .
prime minister erdogan raged on against israel , speaking of " state terrorism , " a " regime of lies " and arguing that israel must now be " punished . "
according to erdogan , whoever chooses to ignore the atrocities of israel makes himself " complicit in the crime against humanity . "
the arduous international efforts to achieve a lasting peace in the middle east are important to turkey , as is the peace process in the caucasus or the balkans .
therefore , they should not be harnessed to the cart of discordant states in the middle east that lack basic democratic structures . there are very few , barely audible voices in turkey that warn against a further verbal escalation .
in europe , the erdogan 's arguments fall on stunned ears .
although he condemns anti-semitism and promises the jewish community in his country security , the waves of anti-israeli hatred have reached turkey .
one of the few sensible voices in europe came from ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign committee of the german bundestag .
he called , contrary to the stance of germany 's christian democrats , for attempts to further motivate turkey towards eu membership rather than to reject it on religious and cultural grounds . it 's easy to see which camp turkey will fall into if its bid for eu membership fails . the eu would be acting in their own foreign policy interests by keeping turkey on the membership track .

she denounces the government 's anti-maoist offensive , which has been codenamed operation green hunt . " it has gone terribly wrong , " she told deutsche welle .
" to try and sort out this very deep problem militarily is to create a situation , which is quickly spiraling out of anybody 's ability to extract any kind of morality out of the various atrocities that are taking place .
unless they try to negotiate some kind of ceasefire , somehow , i do n't see how it is going to be sorted out .
i do n't even know whether talks can sort it out but certainly they have to try another tack . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 50,000 paramilitary troops are involved in operation green hunt the offensive to quell the maoist rebellion in the rural heartland involves 56,000 paramilitary troops in six states . offensive linked to economic interests roy claims the offensive is closely linked with economic interests .
" in states like orissa and jharkand , the security forces are moving against everybody resisting the takeover of their land by mining corporations , " she said . " millions of people are displaced from their lands by a government which is taking over resources .
i hate that word but they are taking over mountains , forests and land to hand them over to corporations .
hundreds and hundreds of mous have been signed .
environmental engineering and social engineering is taking place in the country .
anybody who thwarts that plan , whether maoists , gandhians or gandhian socialists or whoever they are , the minute somebody raises their voice or if somebody is effective , security moves against them .
they do n't mind dissent as long as they know it is entirely ineffective . " after meeting maoist guerrillas in their forest base earlier this year , roy penned a 20,000 word essay , arguing that the maoists had a point when they say the gap between the rich and the poor has increased .
the levers of government , she maintained , are increasingly controlled by private entities . " india today is a country where a lot of the growth rate is fuelled by this mining money , " she reiterated to deutsche welle .
" this situation is not new .
latin america has seen it , africa has seen it .
the kind of money you are talking about is so great that you can buy governments , buy the media , buy the courts , you can buy the whole country .
you can run the country and these people are gradually running the country .
the elections are not between the bjp , congress or the samajwadi party .
they are between the ambanis , the tatas , the mittals – the people pulling the strings now . " " two-pronged strategy is moronic " this situation is what makes the current offensive against the maoists even more absurd , she argues .
" this two-pronged strategy is moronic because the government 's idea of development is what caused the problem in the first place , " she said . " how are you going to solve it by what 's creating the problem as well as a military assault ?
operation green hunt is being built up as a war – they do n't want to use the word war but as an offensive let 's say – against the communist party of india -lrb- maoist -rrb- , which is a banned party . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last week , over 140 people were killed when a mumbai-bound train derailed .
the accident was blamed on the maoists .
the debate around the maoists in indian society is polarized – some support military action , others such as roy and certain rights activists say the rebels are a symptom of social inequity and decry the military offensive . the discussion is not likely to subside and has become more heated of late , as maoist attacks have become more deadly , increasingly targeting security personnel and even civilians . author : murali krishnan -lrb- new delhi -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some have been bussed to the border with jordan , while most have been brought to tel aviv 's ben gurion airport .
according to israeli foreign ministry spokesman jigdal palmor , the majority of the activists have already returned to their home countries .
of the 11 germans , five have arrived back home .
of the six still waiting to be cleared for flights , one had to be treated for injuries at a hospital near the airport .
the activists on board the ships claimed to be part of a humanitarian mission to gaza and were being held in israel for questioning about the incident .

" this has been a clear act of piracy , " he angrily told reporters .
" i 'm anxious to hear what the german government and parliament have to say about this act of piracy , which if it had occurred near somalia would be treated as such . "
german foreign minister guido westerwelle has criticised the israeli raid while german chancellor angela merkel has called for a lifting of the blockade of gaza . also on board were matthias jochheim , a german representative of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war ; inge hoeger and annette groth , current left party members of parliament ; and nadel el sakka , a representative of the palestinian community in germany .
bildunterschrift : among those detained onboard the aid flotilla were least 38 different nationalities , many of them turks but also israelis , palestinians and more than a hundred europeans .
hoeger , one of the two members of parliament , said the women on the ship were quickly shut in a lower level of the ship , the so-called ' women 's deck , ' during the night .
" we could n't get out , we did n't know what was going on above because we were locked in , " she said .
" we put on our life vests and eventually we figured out that the ship was occupied , that the israelis had taken it over . "
hoeger and her colleague groth said they did not know who had shut them in - the organizers of the flotilla or the israelis .
after they were let out they were searched , handcuffed and brought to the port in the israeli city of ashdod .
there they were allowed to contact the german embassy , she said .
" this is against any kind of international law , just like the blockade of gaza is against international law , " she said .
" and through our actions we wanted to make it known that this is illegal . "
netanyahu dismisses un criticism israel says it has processed activists of at least 38 different nationalities , many of them turks but also israelis , palestinians and more than a hundred europeans .

israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu on monday defended the seizure of the aid flotilla , accusing critics of " hypocrisy " .
in a televised address to the nation , he said he would continue to blockade the hamas-run gaza strip , arguing that lifting the embargo would turn the palestinian enclave into a base of iranian missiles. ai / reuters / ap / dpa editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

swedish foreign minister carl bildt was among the european leaders in sarajevo lending his support to some balkan nations bidding to join the eu .
" there are a number of countries where enthusiasm for enlargement is less than 100 percent these days .
then it is important that we come here to reaffirm and say ... the door is open , " bildt said .
of the nations that emerged from the violent collapse of yugoslavia in the 1990s , slovenia has already joined the eu , croatia is close to membership and serbia , montenegro and macedonia have applied .
to the south , albania has also applied .
bosnia , which remains an international protectorate divided along ethnic lines , and kosovo , whose independence serbia and some eu states do not recognise , are lagging behind .
balkans welcome in light of the ongoing debt crisis in europe , there was some concern in the balkans that progress would be bogged down on absorbing new nations into the block .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign affairs chief catherine ashton with bosnia -lrb- r -rrb- and spain -lrb- l -rrb- foreign ministers at the meeting but bildt added that he expected " strong reaffirmation by the eu " encouraging the balkan nations to push on with their efforts to join the eu .
spain , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency and organized the meeting , added that balkan countries were welcome in the eu " a very good future for the whole region , a european future , and a commitment of the international community to support all western balkans to join the eu , that is the main message today , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos .
however , many balkan states will be hoping more than rhetoric comes out of the meeting .
this could come in the form of extending the right to travel without visas in the eu 's schengen zone to bosnia and albania , an idea put forth in brussels last week .
this right has already been given to serbia , montenegro and macedonia .
conference downgraded the sarajevo conference was originally planned as a summit , but reconfigured as informal talks because of the current row between serbia and its former province kosovo .
belgrade refuses to acknowledge kosovo , which declared independence from serbia in 2008 , and serbian officials insist they will not formally share any table with their kosovo counterparts . because the conference has revised its format , it will now not issue any formal declaration at the end of proceedings. mz / cb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 02.06.2010 turkey and us face tough decisions on relations after israeli flotilla raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as turkey 's relations with israel dive , ankara looks to the us while its relations with israel continue to plummet to new depths in the wake of the gaza flotilla raid , turkey is considering how to handle the us as washington tries to balance its ties with jerusalem and ankara . few countries are more enraged by israel 's raid on the gaza aid flotilla than turkey .
much of the action during monday 's pre-dawn raid by israeli commandos was focused on a turkish-flagged ship and at least four of the nine fatalities arising from the attack were pro-palestinian turks . in the days following , relations between turkey and israel have been strained to breaking point with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan calling the raid a " bloody massacre " and accusing israel of " unacceptable lawlessness . " erdogan has even gone so far as to refer to israel - a close partner since diplomatic ties with the jewish state were established in 1949 - as " a festering boil in the middle east that spreads hate and enmity , dynamites regional peace and spreads instability . " in such a situation , it is unsurprising that relations between turkey and israel are currently plummeting to an all-time low , even lower than when the relationship soured over israel 's military operations in gaza in 2008 .
but experts are also watching closely how relations between turkey and israel 's most powerful ally – the united states – will develop as the shockwaves from the flotilla raid ripple on . a furious erdogan wasted no time calling us president barack obama after the incident . " israel is faced with the danger of losing its sole friend in the region and the greatest contributor so far to regional peace , " erdogan told the us president in a one-hour telephone conversation , according to a turkish government statement on wednesday . bildunterschrift : erdogan suggested that turkey could abandon israel but trade and military ties remain too strong turkey-israel ties ' too strong to break ' turkey has been israel 's chief regional ally since a military cooperation deal was signed between the two countries in 1996 .
however , some sections of the us media claim the implication behind erdogan 's statement is that turkey , with its mainly muslim population , could shift its allegiance towards its new-found friends in the arab world , partners which the islamist-rooted government in ankara have been courting for some time . joost lagendijk , a senior advisor at the istanbul policy center , disagrees .
he believes that the connections between turkey and israel are too strong to be severed . " while we will see the two sides divided at an official , political level , turkey and israel will still have strong military and business ties , " he told deutsche welle . " it makes good sense to have good relations with the arabs but rejecting israel for the arabs is not a viable alternative . " while relations – especially those concerning trade – have been improving over the past few years with a host of arab nations , including syria , iran , lebanon and jordan , turkey still has its eyes set on europe and eu membership .
the european union is still the main power that turkey trusts most in the international arena , despite the eu 's continued ambivalence towards ankara 's accession hopes . however , some observers claim that the israeli raid offers turkey an opportunity to dangle the possibility of an eastward shift in the face of the united states to gain some leverage in a number of issues .
joost lagendijk believes it would be foolish to do so . " turkey 's standing in the middle east and its dealing with its arab partners are only possible because it has such good connections with both the us and the eu , ” he said .
“ that 's what makes turkey such an interesting partner to the arabs .
what would the value of turkey be without that ? " steven cook , a middle east expert at the council on foreign relations , believes turkey will pursue its own goals in the middle east and wo n't feel the need to pressure the us into supporting it . " turkey has economic , political and strategic interests in the arab middle east and turkish leaders obviously feel less inhibited to pursue their own interests in the region , regardless of washington 's wishes , " he told deutsche welle .
" the turks are willing to bend the regional rules of the game to serve ankara 's own interests .
if the resulting policies serve us goals at the same time , all well and good .
if not , so be it . " the united states may be closely watching turkey 's growing connection to regional arab powers but is unlikely to feel any threat from its closer ties with the likes of iran and syria .
despite its ambitions , turkey 's current economic and strategic power is still not enough to project discernible influence in the middle east and it still requires good relations with the us and eu to add weight to its status in the region . us looking to keep muslim ally turkey on side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain good relations with turkey bilateral relations by their nature have mutual benefits and turkey is n't the only partner seeking support .
the united states sees turkey as a key muslim ally and the obama administration has been working hard to repair the damage to relations caused by the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion . since then , the us and turkey have set-up intelligence sharing networks in the on-going fight against international terrorism while turkey hosts the us military infrastructure needed for its missions in neighbouring iraq and afghanistan . " turkey is still a key muslim ally to the us and is a favorite partner , one which is held up as an example of a predominantly islamic country with a growing democracy , " joost lagendijk said .
" the us wo n't want to jeapordise that .
if it turns on turkey for any reason , then the whole rhetoric washington has created about reforming the islamic world will crumble . " despite this , steven cook says , the two nations are increasingly finding themselves at odds with each other . " washington and ankara do share the same goals : peace between israel and the palestinians ; a stable , unified iraq ; an iran without nuclear weapons ; stability in afghanistan ; and a western-oriented syria , " he said . " when you get down to details , however , washington and ankara are on the opposite ends of virtually all these issues . " but after six decades of strategic cooperation , the stark reality is that while turkey and the united states are not enemies in the middle east , they are fast becoming strategic competitors . " turkey is asserting itself more in the middle east , where it has gone from a tepid observer to an influential player in eight short years , " cook added . washington faces balancing act with ankara , jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ties with israel will impact on its relations with turkey while turkey and the united states will not want to fall out , the situation arising from the israeli flotilla raid may still give turkey an opportunity to press its own agenda while maintaining strong ties with the us .
as pressure from the international community grows , turkey currently stands a greater chance at getting its own way over ending the blockade of gaza " the world has woken up to the gaza situation and now it is not only turkey calling for the end of the blockade , ” lagendijk said .
“ turkey , if it is clever , can use this to pressure the us which itself is growing more frustrated with the netanyahu government in israel .
maybe this will lead to the us calling for an end to the embargo . " author : nick amies editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

much of the action during monday 's pre-dawn raid by israeli commandos was focused on a turkish-flagged ship and at least four of the nine fatalities arising from the attack were pro-palestinian turks . in the days following , relations between turkey and israel have been strained to breaking point with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan calling the raid a " bloody massacre " and accusing israel of " unacceptable lawlessness . " erdogan has even gone so far as to refer to israel - a close partner since diplomatic ties with the jewish state were established in 1949 - as " a festering boil in the middle east that spreads hate and enmity , dynamites regional peace and spreads instability . " in such a situation , it is unsurprising that relations between turkey and israel are currently plummeting to an all-time low , even lower than when the relationship soured over israel 's military operations in gaza in 2008 .
but experts are also watching closely how relations between turkey and israel 's most powerful ally – the united states – will develop as the shockwaves from the flotilla raid ripple on . a furious erdogan wasted no time calling us president barack obama after the incident . " israel is faced with the danger of losing its sole friend in the region and the greatest contributor so far to regional peace , " erdogan told the us president in a one-hour telephone conversation , according to a turkish government statement on wednesday . bildunterschrift : erdogan suggested that turkey could abandon israel but trade and military ties remain too strong turkey-israel ties ' too strong to break ' turkey has been israel 's chief regional ally since a military cooperation deal was signed between the two countries in 1996 .
however , some sections of the us media claim the implication behind erdogan 's statement is that turkey , with its mainly muslim population , could shift its allegiance towards its new-found friends in the arab world , partners which the islamist-rooted government in ankara have been courting for some time . joost lagendijk , a senior advisor at the istanbul policy center , disagrees .
he believes that the connections between turkey and israel are too strong to be severed . " while we will see the two sides divided at an official , political level , turkey and israel will still have strong military and business ties , " he told deutsche welle . " it makes good sense to have good relations with the arabs but rejecting israel for the arabs is not a viable alternative . " while relations – especially those concerning trade – have been improving over the past few years with a host of arab nations , including syria , iran , lebanon and jordan , turkey still has its eyes set on europe and eu membership .
the european union is still the main power that turkey trusts most in the international arena , despite the eu 's continued ambivalence towards ankara 's accession hopes . however , some observers claim that the israeli raid offers turkey an opportunity to dangle the possibility of an eastward shift in the face of the united states to gain some leverage in a number of issues .
joost lagendijk believes it would be foolish to do so . " turkey 's standing in the middle east and its dealing with its arab partners are only possible because it has such good connections with both the us and the eu , ” he said .
“ that 's what makes turkey such an interesting partner to the arabs .
what would the value of turkey be without that ? " steven cook , a middle east expert at the council on foreign relations , believes turkey will pursue its own goals in the middle east and wo n't feel the need to pressure the us into supporting it . " turkey has economic , political and strategic interests in the arab middle east and turkish leaders obviously feel less inhibited to pursue their own interests in the region , regardless of washington 's wishes , " he told deutsche welle .
" the turks are willing to bend the regional rules of the game to serve ankara 's own interests .
if the resulting policies serve us goals at the same time , all well and good .
if not , so be it . " the united states may be closely watching turkey 's growing connection to regional arab powers but is unlikely to feel any threat from its closer ties with the likes of iran and syria .
despite its ambitions , turkey 's current economic and strategic power is still not enough to project discernible influence in the middle east and it still requires good relations with the us and eu to add weight to its status in the region . us looking to keep muslim ally turkey on side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain good relations with turkey bilateral relations by their nature have mutual benefits and turkey is n't the only partner seeking support .
the united states sees turkey as a key muslim ally and the obama administration has been working hard to repair the damage to relations caused by the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion . since then , the us and turkey have set-up intelligence sharing networks in the on-going fight against international terrorism while turkey hosts the us military infrastructure needed for its missions in neighbouring iraq and afghanistan . " turkey is still a key muslim ally to the us and is a favorite partner , one which is held up as an example of a predominantly islamic country with a growing democracy , " joost lagendijk said .
" the us wo n't want to jeapordise that .
if it turns on turkey for any reason , then the whole rhetoric washington has created about reforming the islamic world will crumble . " despite this , steven cook says , the two nations are increasingly finding themselves at odds with each other . " washington and ankara do share the same goals : peace between israel and the palestinians ; a stable , unified iraq ; an iran without nuclear weapons ; stability in afghanistan ; and a western-oriented syria , " he said . " when you get down to details , however , washington and ankara are on the opposite ends of virtually all these issues . " but after six decades of strategic cooperation , the stark reality is that while turkey and the united states are not enemies in the middle east , they are fast becoming strategic competitors . " turkey is asserting itself more in the middle east , where it has gone from a tepid observer to an influential player in eight short years , " cook added . washington faces balancing act with ankara , jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ties with israel will impact on its relations with turkey while turkey and the united states will not want to fall out , the situation arising from the israeli flotilla raid may still give turkey an opportunity to press its own agenda while maintaining strong ties with the us .
as pressure from the international community grows , turkey currently stands a greater chance at getting its own way over ending the blockade of gaza " the world has woken up to the gaza situation and now it is not only turkey calling for the end of the blockade , ” lagendijk said .
“ turkey , if it is clever , can use this to pressure the us which itself is growing more frustrated with the netanyahu government in israel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 02.06.2010 with cinema jenin , a dream is fulfilled for palestinian youth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the restoration was driven by the parents of ahmed khatib german filmmaker marcus vetter is close to completing the restoration of a cinema in jenin , a town in the palestinian west bank .
the cinema was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago . marcus vetter made a film in jenin three years ago - and stayed on to build a cinema in which to show it .
his documentary film , " the heart of jenin , " is about ahmed khatib , a palestinian boy killed by israeli troops while playing with a toy gun in the town 's refugee camp .
his parents decided to donate their son 's organs to save the lives of other children - arab and israeli .
the documentary won several awards , but it could n't be shown in jenin , where it all happened .
the town 's only movie theater was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago .
ahmed 's parents asked vetter to help renovate and reopen it , because they wanted to create more opportunities for local children .
he agreed , although he 'd never funded or managed a building project before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcus vetter with one of the palestinian teens who 's been helping on the project " you ca n't open such a place just by helping .
it 's impossible as i realized very fast .
this is real work .
what i could have helped with was fundraising , but raising money is nothing - raising money just means corruption , " said vetter .
vetter has run things in an unorthodox way .
he did n't apply for funding before starting .
he just began , with no salaries at all to pay the german architects and engineers .
they 're volunteers .
" just take a step , that 's what we did here , just renovate , do n't talk all the time , and do it with all your passion , " said vetter .
the project is ambitious .
vetter and his team are renovating the old indoor cinema , building an outdoor one , adding a cafe and guest house , as well as setting up a film production and distribution company .
government , private donors covered costs so far , the project has cost more than half a million euros .
most of the money has come from the german government , with the rest from corporate donors and ordinary people .
along the way , money has always been tight .
earlier this year , vetter simply ran out of cash .

the cinema was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago . marcus vetter made a film in jenin three years ago - and stayed on to build a cinema in which to show it .
his documentary film , " the heart of jenin , " is about ahmed khatib , a palestinian boy killed by israeli troops while playing with a toy gun in the town 's refugee camp .
his parents decided to donate their son 's organs to save the lives of other children - arab and israeli .
the documentary won several awards , but it could n't be shown in jenin , where it all happened .
the town 's only movie theater was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago .
ahmed 's parents asked vetter to help renovate and reopen it , because they wanted to create more opportunities for local children .
he agreed , although he 'd never funded or managed a building project before .

the cinema was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago . marcus vetter made a film in jenin three years ago - and stayed on to build a cinema in which to show it .
his documentary film , " the heart of jenin , " is about ahmed khatib , a palestinian boy killed by israeli troops while playing with a toy gun in the town 's refugee camp .
his parents decided to donate their son 's organs to save the lives of other children - arab and israeli .
the documentary won several awards , but it could n't be shown in jenin , where it all happened .
the town 's only movie theater was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago .
ahmed 's parents asked vetter to help renovate and reopen it , because they wanted to create more opportunities for local children .
he agreed , although he 'd never funded or managed a building project before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcus vetter with one of the palestinian teens who 's been helping on the project " you ca n't open such a place just by helping .
it 's impossible as i realized very fast .
this is real work .
what i could have helped with was fundraising , but raising money is nothing - raising money just means corruption , " said vetter .
vetter has run things in an unorthodox way .
he did n't apply for funding before starting .
he just began , with no salaries at all to pay the german architects and engineers .
they 're volunteers .
" just take a step , that 's what we did here , just renovate , do n't talk all the time , and do it with all your passion , " said vetter .
the project is ambitious .
vetter and his team are renovating the old indoor cinema , building an outdoor one , adding a cafe and guest house , as well as setting up a film production and distribution company .
government , private donors covered costs so far , the project has cost more than half a million euros .
most of the money has come from the german government , with the rest from corporate donors and ordinary people .
along the way , money has always been tight .
earlier this year , vetter simply ran out of cash .
he wrote to six donors saying he needed 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- to finish the job .
only one of them replied - legendary british musician roger waters , of pink floyd fame .
" having met all the people involved i felt connected to them and i felt it was the least i could do to give them the money to finish the project , " said waters , talking by phone from the united states .
waters says he was inspired to help by the generosity of ahmed khatib 's father .
" this project was fundamentally and always attached to that story , that incredibly moving story .
he gives the rest of us hope that we may at some point find a partial solution to the plight the palestinian people find themselves in , " said waters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck delivers all the technical equipment to the cinema dialogue with other cultures fakhri hamad , the project manager for cinema jenin , says the project is changing the town .
" we started with a small idea to have a place for kids to play and learn but it 's had local and international support , and it 's grown and grown .
now it 's become a project of the town itself .
jenin has the chance to prove it 's ready to accept other cultures , to accept peace and to accept dialogue , " said hamad .
it 's been a huge turnaround for jenin , a town with a population of around 250,000 which became known as the source of a third of the suicide bombers of the palestinian uprising known as the second intifada .
now , young palestinians are learning about filmmaking side by side with german students , as well as working on the building site together .
opposition from intellectuals but there has been some palestinian opposition to the project .
earlier this year , palestinian intellectuals criticized cinema jenin , arguing that it " normalized " relations between palestinians and israel .
they said the project relied on cooperation with israel and that they opposed building a cinema while israel 's occupation army remained in the west bank .
vetter admits that he was discouraged .
" i did think then that the project might fail .
i thought that i ca n't keep giving my time to a project which has a fundamentalist approach .
it was very depressing , " said vetter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's still a long way to go on the building site but the faith of ordinary people in the project restored vetter 's commitment , as did the unswerving determination of ahmed khatib 's parents .
for them , cinema jenin is the fulfilment of a dream .
they want the town 's young people to have more of everything than their son had - more opportunities , more of a future , and of course more security .
when he died , ahmed saved the lives of the five children who received his organs .
with this movie theater , established in his memory , they hope he will touch the lives of countless more .
opening in time for world cup cinema jenin is now almost complete .
the members of the project team hope to open the outdoor cinema in time for the world cup later this month .
the official opening of the restored indoor cinema is scheduled for august .

the accusations are in connection with the hiring of a priest alleged to have been a sex offender in the 1980s . german prosecutors announced on wednesday that they were investigating claims that the head of the german bishops ' conference , robert zollitsch , aided and abetted a known sex offender in the church .
prosecutors said that they had received information indicating that , while zollitsch was in charge of the personnel department of a diocese in southern germany in 1987 , he appointed a priest who was known to have abused children .
the archdiocese of freiburg has released a statement denying that zollitsch was responsible for the appointment .
aiding and abetting prosecutors confirmed that they had launched an investigation , following reports by public broadcaster ard and the suedkurier newspaper .
the freiburg archdiocese has described the media reports as " absolutely weak " and " sensationalist . "
in 1987 zollitsch was head of the human resources department of the diocese of freiburg .
he is accused of rehiring a priest accused of sexually abusing children in a monestary in the 1960s .
the diocese says that the appointment was entirely in the hands of the monastery 's abbot , and that zollitsch neither knew of the original allegations nor the subsequent re-appointment .
part of a wider scandal sexual abuse scandals have rocked the church in germany since january , when dozens of cases emerged involving allegations of the sexual molestation of minors by priests and other clergy over a period of 50 years at catholic schools .
as head of the bishops ' conference , zollitsch has been at the forefront of the catholic church 's response to the ongoing reports of abuse .
he has often stated that the church needs to reform and " heal the wounds of victims . "
in his easter messages to his freiburg parishoners , he said the catholic church must examine its " dark aspects as well as our own shadowy sides .

the accusations are in connection with the hiring of a priest alleged to have been a sex offender in the 1980s . german prosecutors announced on wednesday that they were investigating claims that the head of the german bishops ' conference , robert zollitsch , aided and abetted a known sex offender in the church .
prosecutors said that they had received information indicating that , while zollitsch was in charge of the personnel department of a diocese in southern germany in 1987 , he appointed a priest who was known to have abused children .
the archdiocese of freiburg has released a statement denying that zollitsch was responsible for the appointment .
aiding and abetting prosecutors confirmed that they had launched an investigation , following reports by public broadcaster ard and the suedkurier newspaper .
the freiburg archdiocese has described the media reports as " absolutely weak " and " sensationalist . "
in 1987 zollitsch was head of the human resources department of the diocese of freiburg .
he is accused of rehiring a priest accused of sexually abusing children in a monestary in the 1960s .
the diocese says that the appointment was entirely in the hands of the monastery 's abbot , and that zollitsch neither knew of the original allegations nor the subsequent re-appointment .
part of a wider scandal sexual abuse scandals have rocked the church in germany since january , when dozens of cases emerged involving allegations of the sexual molestation of minors by priests and other clergy over a period of 50 years at catholic schools .
as head of the bishops ' conference , zollitsch has been at the forefront of the catholic church 's response to the ongoing reports of abuse .
he has often stated that the church needs to reform and " heal the wounds of victims . "
in his easter messages to his freiburg parishoners , he said the catholic church must examine its " dark aspects as well as our own shadowy sides .

his long career and definitive pronouncements have earned him the irreverent nickname " the pope of german letters . "
on june 2 , he turns 90 . marcel reich-ranicki was in charge of the literature section of the national newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in the 1970s , and hosted the television book discussion program " literary quartet " throughout the 1990 's .
these and many other public appearances where he freely made his pronouncements on german books and writing have made him one of germany 's best-known cultural critics .
reich-ranicki , who is celebrating his 90th birthday on june 2 , is also one of just a handful of jewish public figures in germany to resettle in the country after having survived world war ii .
born in 1920 in wloclawek , poland , the future critic attended high school in berlin .
because he was jewish , he was denied entry to the university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the critic , just ending his ninth decade , is still up for an argument after being deported to poland , reich-ranicki was able to flee the warsaw ghetto with his wife , tosia .
in 1958 , he returned to germany and dedicated himself to the study of german language and literature - and saw an opening for himself in the world of german letters .
risky career move " when i came to germany in ' 58 , and i saw what people were writing about literature in the -lsb- newspapers here , -rsb- i told my wife : i want to do an experiment , " reich-ranicki said in an acceptance speech after receiving the north rhine-westphalia state prize in 2005 .
" these people write so confusingly , so cryptically , i just do n't like their criticism , " he continued .
" i will say loud and clear what i think about books .
it is risky , and two things could happen : i will either rise to the top of the literary criticism hierarchy , or sink to the very bottom .
but i have to try . "
reich-ranicki has remained incorruptible and sharp in his opinions , and he does n't mince words .
that attitude has cost him a few friends over the years .
his dedication to speaking the truth as he sees it was behind a major uproar in 2008 , when he was invited to receive an honorary german television prize for his cultural contributions .
as recipients awaiting awards usually do , he sat passively in the audience as one tv personality after another came up to make a speech , accept an award , or tell a few jokes .
critic who speaks his mind he was definitely not impressed with what he saw - and he made no secret of his feelings .
when the time came for him to accept his honorary award , he stunned viewers by rejecting it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel awarded reich-ranicki the henri-nannen prize in 2008 " i can not accept this prize , " reich-ranicki told the shocked audience .
" i did n't know what to expect here , and i think it is awful that i had to sit through this for so many hours . "
at first , some of the guests at the ceremony thought reich-ranicki was joking .
but in this case he was simply telling it like he saw it - live and on the air .
by giving an open , radical critique of what he saw as the poor state of german television , reich-ranicki underlined his reputation as something of a crank , not to mention a " hard taskmaster " and a " a specialist in executions , " as different critics have put it .
reich-ranicki answers his detractors by saying that indeed , his first and foremost job is to be tough and critical .
years on ' literary quartet ' " being called an ' execution specialist ' is really nonsense , " reich-ranicki told broadcaster wdr in a 1986 interview .
" but i try to be clear in my criticism .
and the clarity of criticism , well , that is a question of politesse .
you have to be polite to the readers .
and that means being clear and explicit with your meaning , not hiding behind ambiguous or enigmatic phrases . "
his appearances as the head critic on television 's " literary quartet " between 1988 and 2001 brought reich-ranicki to the small screen some 77 times - automatically launching him to the top of germany 's lit-crit pop cultural heap .
despite his fame , however , he certainly is n't infallible .
and if he had a reputation for judging literature based more on his personal reading preferences than on serious criticism , well , that did n't stop his opinion from making and breaking many a literary career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his 2008 rejection of the german tv prize came as a shock those who raised his wrath - peter handke , guenter grass or martin walser , for example - had to fight their way into the market .
on the contrary , favorites such as spanish writer javier marias or berlin chronicler judith hermann more or less owe their success to reich-ranicki 's praises .
boring book ?
bad news the worst thing that reich-ranicki could say about a book was : " boring . "
his anti-academic , folksy and agreeably polemical ideas about literature can most likely be traced back to his own , sad biography .
as a persecuted jew he escaped the warsaw ghetto and various deportations , as though by a miracle .
at the time , a polish printer hid reich-ranicki and his wife from the nazis .
in payment , the literature lover regaled his benefactors with an endless slew of stories : shakespeare , goethe , schiller , etc .
telling stories to stay alive - the experience made a lasting impression on reich-ranicki , whose biggest successes came when he broke literary-criticism taboos .
years later , he wrote his own life story , and - unlike the biographies of many other critics - this one became a bestseller .

because he was jewish , he was denied entry to the university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the critic , just ending his ninth decade , is still up for an argument after being deported to poland , reich-ranicki was able to flee the warsaw ghetto with his wife , tosia .
in 1958 , he returned to germany and dedicated himself to the study of german language and literature - and saw an opening for himself in the world of german letters .
risky career move " when i came to germany in ' 58 , and i saw what people were writing about literature in the -lsb- newspapers here , -rsb- i told my wife : i want to do an experiment , " reich-ranicki said in an acceptance speech after receiving the north rhine-westphalia state prize in 2005 .
" these people write so confusingly , so cryptically , i just do n't like their criticism , " he continued .
" i will say loud and clear what i think about books .
it is risky , and two things could happen : i will either rise to the top of the literary criticism hierarchy , or sink to the very bottom .
but i have to try . "
reich-ranicki has remained incorruptible and sharp in his opinions , and he does n't mince words .
that attitude has cost him a few friends over the years .
his dedication to speaking the truth as he sees it was behind a major uproar in 2008 , when he was invited to receive an honorary german television prize for his cultural contributions .
as recipients awaiting awards usually do , he sat passively in the audience as one tv personality after another came up to make a speech , accept an award , or tell a few jokes .
critic who speaks his mind he was definitely not impressed with what he saw - and he made no secret of his feelings .
when the time came for him to accept his honorary award , he stunned viewers by rejecting it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel awarded reich-ranicki the henri-nannen prize in 2008 " i can not accept this prize , " reich-ranicki told the shocked audience .
" i did n't know what to expect here , and i think it is awful that i had to sit through this for so many hours . "
at first , some of the guests at the ceremony thought reich-ranicki was joking .
but in this case he was simply telling it like he saw it - live and on the air .
by giving an open , radical critique of what he saw as the poor state of german television , reich-ranicki underlined his reputation as something of a crank , not to mention a " hard taskmaster " and a " a specialist in executions , " as different critics have put it .
reich-ranicki answers his detractors by saying that indeed , his first and foremost job is to be tough and critical .
years on ' literary quartet ' " being called an ' execution specialist ' is really nonsense , " reich-ranicki told broadcaster wdr in a 1986 interview .
" but i try to be clear in my criticism .
and the clarity of criticism , well , that is a question of politesse .
you have to be polite to the readers .
and that means being clear and explicit with your meaning , not hiding behind ambiguous or enigmatic phrases . "
his appearances as the head critic on television 's " literary quartet " between 1988 and 2001 brought reich-ranicki to the small screen some 77 times - automatically launching him to the top of germany 's lit-crit pop cultural heap .
despite his fame , however , he certainly is n't infallible .
and if he had a reputation for judging literature based more on his personal reading preferences than on serious criticism , well , that did n't stop his opinion from making and breaking many a literary career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his 2008 rejection of the german tv prize came as a shock those who raised his wrath - peter handke , guenter grass or martin walser , for example - had to fight their way into the market .
on the contrary , favorites such as spanish writer javier marias or berlin chronicler judith hermann more or less owe their success to reich-ranicki 's praises .
boring book ?
bad news the worst thing that reich-ranicki could say about a book was : " boring . "
his anti-academic , folksy and agreeably polemical ideas about literature can most likely be traced back to his own , sad biography .
as a persecuted jew he escaped the warsaw ghetto and various deportations , as though by a miracle .
at the time , a polish printer hid reich-ranicki and his wife from the nazis .
in payment , the literature lover regaled his benefactors with an endless slew of stories : shakespeare , goethe , schiller , etc .
telling stories to stay alive - the experience made a lasting impression on reich-ranicki , whose biggest successes came when he broke literary-criticism taboos .
years later , he wrote his own life story , and - unlike the biographies of many other critics - this one became a bestseller .

his appearances as the head critic on television 's " literary quartet " between 1988 and 2001 brought reich-ranicki to the small screen some 77 times - automatically launching him to the top of germany 's lit-crit pop cultural heap .

his long career and definitive pronouncements have earned him the irreverent nickname " the pope of german letters . "
on june 2 , he turns 90 . marcel reich-ranicki was in charge of the literature section of the national newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in the 1970s , and hosted the television book discussion program " literary quartet " throughout the 1990 's .
these and many other public appearances where he freely made his pronouncements on german books and writing have made him one of germany 's best-known cultural critics .
reich-ranicki , who is celebrating his 90th birthday on june 2 , is also one of just a handful of jewish public figures in germany to resettle in the country after having survived world war ii .
born in 1920 in wloclawek , poland , the future critic attended high school in berlin .
because he was jewish , he was denied entry to the university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the critic , just ending his ninth decade , is still up for an argument after being deported to poland , reich-ranicki was able to flee the warsaw ghetto with his wife , tosia .
in 1958 , he returned to germany and dedicated himself to the study of german language and literature - and saw an opening for himself in the world of german letters .
risky career move " when i came to germany in ' 58 , and i saw what people were writing about literature in the -lsb- newspapers here , -rsb- i told my wife : i want to do an experiment , " reich-ranicki said in an acceptance speech after receiving the north rhine-westphalia state prize in 2005 .
" these people write so confusingly , so cryptically , i just do n't like their criticism , " he continued .
" i will say loud and clear what i think about books .
it is risky , and two things could happen : i will either rise to the top of the literary criticism hierarchy , or sink to the very bottom .
but i have to try . "
reich-ranicki has remained incorruptible and sharp in his opinions , and he does n't mince words .
that attitude has cost him a few friends over the years .
his dedication to speaking the truth as he sees it was behind a major uproar in 2008 , when he was invited to receive an honorary german television prize for his cultural contributions .
as recipients awaiting awards usually do , he sat passively in the audience as one tv personality after another came up to make a speech , accept an award , or tell a few jokes .
critic who speaks his mind he was definitely not impressed with what he saw - and he made no secret of his feelings .
when the time came for him to accept his honorary award , he stunned viewers by rejecting it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel awarded reich-ranicki the henri-nannen prize in 2008 " i can not accept this prize , " reich-ranicki told the shocked audience .
" i did n't know what to expect here , and i think it is awful that i had to sit through this for so many hours . "
at first , some of the guests at the ceremony thought reich-ranicki was joking .
but in this case he was simply telling it like he saw it - live and on the air .
by giving an open , radical critique of what he saw as the poor state of german television , reich-ranicki underlined his reputation as something of a crank , not to mention a " hard taskmaster " and a " a specialist in executions , " as different critics have put it .
reich-ranicki answers his detractors by saying that indeed , his first and foremost job is to be tough and critical .
years on ' literary quartet ' " being called an ' execution specialist ' is really nonsense , " reich-ranicki told broadcaster wdr in a 1986 interview .
" but i try to be clear in my criticism .
and the clarity of criticism , well , that is a question of politesse .
you have to be polite to the readers .
and that means being clear and explicit with your meaning , not hiding behind ambiguous or enigmatic phrases . "
his appearances as the head critic on television 's " literary quartet " between 1988 and 2001 brought reich-ranicki to the small screen some 77 times - automatically launching him to the top of germany 's lit-crit pop cultural heap .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 02.06.2010 european commission plans reform of rating agency regulation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies are blamed for worsening the financial crisis credit rating agencies in the european union could soon be subject to new operating regulations , but some analysts fear that too much regulation will stifle competition in an sector already under a virtual oligopoly . the european commission on wednesday unveiled new proposals for regulating credit rating agencies -lrb- cras -rrb- , which some analysts blame for exacerbating the turmoil in european financial markets .
the new guidelines provide stricter transparency guidelines , and place cra regulation under the authority of the european securities and markets authority -lrb- esma -rrb- , which the commission established last year and is due to come into force at the start of 2011 .
the esma would have the authority to impose sanctions on agencies , and even withdraw their licenses when they fail to comply with regulations .
the three main credit rating agencies , standard & poor 's , moody 's and fitch , had operated with significant latitude before the eu began issuing licenses and demanding a certain level of transparency just last year , according to karel lannoo , director of the european credit research institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lowered bond ratings have made it hard for greece to finance its budget " when the financial crisis started in 2007 , it was very clear that the ratings which the rating agencies gave were not based on pure objective facts , " he told deutsche welle .
" there were huge conflicts of interest .
that 's why the eu was then convinced that there should be a piece of regulation . "
case for regulation one function of rating agencies is to rate the risk of government bonds , using a scale of aaa for the most secure to d for an almost certain default .
the agencies then sell these ratings to investors and banks .
the conflict of interest appears when the agencies rate the very institutions that buy their services , said robert halver , stock analyst for baader bank .
" the rating agencies finance themselves very strongly with the sale of analytical instruments on pension funds , insurance agencies and banks , because everyone assumes that they have a lot of knowledge about country 's risks , " he told deutsche welle .
another reason for further regulation is the role cras have played in crises related to the public finance of budgets , most notably in greece but also in spain , portugal and italy , said lannoo .
when ratings agencies devalue government bonds , it creates a problem of " systemic stability . "
" all of a sudden these ratings agencies have drastically downgraded the debt of these countries , which as given rise to systemic effects , in the sense that many investors have started to sell the securities or the bonds of these countries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker has proposed a new cra close to the european central bank more competition halver said one solution to europe 's problem with cras would be the creation of a european rating agency to compete with the " big three , " as long as it was n't under the supervision of a public entity like the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- or the european commission , as eurogroup president jean-claude juncker recently suggested .
" then there would be suspicion that they would exercise their influence and try to sugarcoat negative evaluations , " he said .
" that can not happen . "
lannoo said the big three already have a european component in fitch , whose main shareholder is european .
rather than constructing a new european rating agency , he said regulators should instead make it easier for already-existing agencies to be licensed as cras .
" what in fact we need to do is ... to lower the entry barriers into the sector , " he said .
" but what we in fact have done with this european regulation now is just the opposite - we have increased the entry thresholds because it 's extremely difficult to be in line with this piece of regulation . "

the new guidelines provide stricter transparency guidelines , and place cra regulation under the authority of the european securities and markets authority -lrb- esma -rrb- , which the commission established last year and is due to come into force at the start of 2011 .
the esma would have the authority to impose sanctions on agencies , and even withdraw their licenses when they fail to comply with regulations .

some analysts are saying the next days will be crucial for its future . in an editorial , the website of german public broadcaster zdf said " the fate of this -lsb- government -rsb- coalition will be decided in the next ten days . "
that 's a drastic view , but there 's no doubt that the resignation of the german president , horst koehler , on monday has delivered a major blow to the government .
it has many important issues to be dealing with : the crisis in the eurozone , the need for drastic savings , or the military involvement in afghanistan , to mention just a few .
and the government coalition , made up of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , has a few crises of its own : the poor showing of the two parties in the indecisive regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the sudden resignation of powerful regional leader roland koch in hessen , the internal backbiting within the liberal party , and disastrous opinion poll ratings .
so the chancellor , angela merkel , could well do without the scramble to find a convincing new president within 30 days , as required by the constitution .
is it a crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she regretted koehler 's departure and had tried to change his mind in a major interview on the evening of koehler 's resignation , she insisted , " we have to be sure not to make a crisis out of every challenge . "
but peter stuetzle , head of deutsche welle 's berlin office , thinks that a crisis is exactly what this is .
" this has been one too much for the government , " he says .
" there 's been a lot of trouble , and the government was just about to try to leave all that behind , and in this minute , koehler resigns . "
if the current government were doing well , the resignation would just be a nuisance , but it 's a sign of the government 's problems that the nuisance was immediately seen as a crisis .
all at sea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's coalition partners have already said they 'll leave the choice up to her wolfgang bosbach , a senior cdu backbencher , says that people do n't trust politicians of any party to solve the country 's problems , and so when respected figures like koehler or koch resign , the people feel that " the good people have left the ship , and we do n't how we will carry on in this rough sea . " what he , as a government supporter , fails to mention , is that , even if the people are disillusioned with all politicians , it 's his coalition which has the power to pilot the ship , and so that 's where the criticism hits particularly hard .
merkel has often been criticized for her lack of leadership - she tends to sit things out and wait until a consensus emerges - but the choice of a new president will require decisive action . peter stuetzle thinks the whole coalition has recognized the need .
her partners - not just the liberals , but also her bavarian sister-party , the csu - have agreed that they will do without their own candidates , and let her make the choice . " everything will be very fast , " he thinks , " and if it 's fast , and if it 's convincing too , then the government might even come out of the whole thing with a better public image at the end of the day .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she regretted koehler 's departure and had tried to change his mind in a major interview on the evening of koehler 's resignation , she insisted , " we have to be sure not to make a crisis out of every challenge . "
but peter stuetzle , head of deutsche welle 's berlin office , thinks that a crisis is exactly what this is .
" this has been one too much for the government , " he says .
" there 's been a lot of trouble , and the government was just about to try to leave all that behind , and in this minute , koehler resigns . "
if the current government were doing well , the resignation would just be a nuisance , but it 's a sign of the government 's problems that the nuisance was immediately seen as a crisis .
all at sea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's coalition partners have already said they 'll leave the choice up to her wolfgang bosbach , a senior cdu backbencher , says that people do n't trust politicians of any party to solve the country 's problems , and so when respected figures like koehler or koch resign , the people feel that " the good people have left the ship , and we do n't how we will carry on in this rough sea . " what he , as a government supporter , fails to mention , is that , even if the people are disillusioned with all politicians , it 's his coalition which has the power to pilot the ship , and so that 's where the criticism hits particularly hard .
merkel has often been criticized for her lack of leadership - she tends to sit things out and wait until a consensus emerges - but the choice of a new president will require decisive action . peter stuetzle thinks the whole coalition has recognized the need .
her partners - not just the liberals , but also her bavarian sister-party , the csu - have agreed that they will do without their own candidates , and let her make the choice . " everything will be very fast , " he thinks , " and if it 's fast , and if it 's convincing too , then the government might even come out of the whole thing with a better public image at the end of the day . "

turkey has attempted to play mediator in middle east , but that was before an israeli military attack on a turkish aid ship .
ankara is playing with fire , says baha guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . the whole world knows that israel is not squeamish about enforcing its interests .
and in light of the latest attacks on gaza , it is a fact that israel will not hesitate violating human rights under the pretext of self-defense and attacking people with brute military force without regard for civilian casualties .
the question must be asked : what was the purpose of the actions of this independent turkish aid organization ?
the officially stated goals were not achieved ; the flotilla could neither break the israeli naval blockade nor bring relief supplies directly to gaza .
for weeks , israel had communicated to turkey through all available diplomatic channels that such aid action would , if necessary , be stopped with violence .
israel made good on its threats and boarded the largest ship of the maritime aid convoy , contravening international maritime law .
in the process there was a shoot-out : at least nine people died and dozens more were injured .
and now , the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan rages unchecked against israel and is playing a dangerous game .
turkey has been a nato member for almost 60 years .
as an ally in the western defense alliance , turkey has a peace obligation .
recent turkish diplomacy has succeeded in smoothing the tensions between iran and the west and mediating between syria and israel while remaining credible in the process .
but with this week 's incident , turkey has reduced itself to just another member of the anti-israel front in the middle east .
at the very least , turkey 's credibility regarding future mediation is put in doubt .
the turkish ship was decorated with giant turkish and palestinian flags .
the image of the incident was that israeli soldiers captured a turkish ship .
in turkey , tens of thousands of demonstrators were mobilized and laid siege to israel 's diplomatic missions .
prime minister erdogan raged on against israel , speaking of " state terrorism , " a " regime of lies " and arguing that israel must now be " punished . "
according to erdogan , whoever chooses to ignore the atrocities of israel makes himself " complicit in the crime against humanity . "
the arduous international efforts to achieve a lasting peace in the middle east are important to turkey , as is the peace process in the caucasus or the balkans .
therefore , they should not be harnessed to the cart of discordant states in the middle east that lack basic democratic structures . there are very few , barely audible voices in turkey that warn against a further verbal escalation .
in europe , the erdogan 's arguments fall on stunned ears .
although he condemns anti-semitism and promises the jewish community in his country security , the waves of anti-israeli hatred have reached turkey .
one of the few sensible voices in europe came from ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign committee of the german bundestag .
he called , contrary to the stance of germany 's christian democrats , for attempts to further motivate turkey towards eu membership rather than to reject it on religious and cultural grounds . it 's easy to see which camp turkey will fall into if its bid for eu membership fails . the eu would be acting in their own foreign policy interests by keeping turkey on the membership track .

the officially stated goals were not achieved ; the flotilla could neither break the israeli naval blockade nor bring relief supplies directly to gaza .
for weeks , israel had communicated to turkey through all available diplomatic channels that such aid action would , if necessary , be stopped with violence .
israel made good on its threats and boarded the largest ship of the maritime aid convoy , contravening international maritime law .
in the process there was a shoot-out : at least nine people died and dozens more were injured .
and now , the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan rages unchecked against israel and is playing a dangerous game .
turkey has been a nato member for almost 60 years .
as an ally in the western defense alliance , turkey has a peace obligation .
recent turkish diplomacy has succeeded in smoothing the tensions between iran and the west and mediating between syria and israel while remaining credible in the process .
but with this week 's incident , turkey has reduced itself to just another member of the anti-israel front in the middle east .
at the very least , turkey 's credibility regarding future mediation is put in doubt .
the turkish ship was decorated with giant turkish and palestinian flags .
the image of the incident was that israeli soldiers captured a turkish ship .
in turkey , tens of thousands of demonstrators were mobilized and laid siege to israel 's diplomatic missions .
prime minister erdogan raged on against israel , speaking of " state terrorism , " a " regime of lies " and arguing that israel must now be " punished . "
according to erdogan , whoever chooses to ignore the atrocities of israel makes himself " complicit in the crime against humanity . "
the arduous international efforts to achieve a lasting peace in the middle east are important to turkey , as is the peace process in the caucasus or the balkans .
therefore , they should not be harnessed to the cart of discordant states in the middle east that lack basic democratic structures . there are very few , barely audible voices in turkey that warn against a further verbal escalation .
in europe , the erdogan 's arguments fall on stunned ears .
although he condemns anti-semitism and promises the jewish community in his country security , the waves of anti-israeli hatred have reached turkey .
one of the few sensible voices in europe came from ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign committee of the german bundestag .
he called , contrary to the stance of germany 's christian democrats , for attempts to further motivate turkey towards eu membership rather than to reject it on religious and cultural grounds . it 's easy to see which camp turkey will fall into if its bid for eu membership fails . the eu would be acting in their own foreign policy interests by keeping turkey on the membership track .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 02.06.2010 german president 's resignation is a blow to the government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel probably never expected that koehler would cause a crisis for her the sudden resignation of the german president , horst koehler , is yet another challenge to a much-challenged government .
some analysts are saying the next days will be crucial for its future . in an editorial , the website of german public broadcaster zdf said " the fate of this -lsb- government -rsb- coalition will be decided in the next ten days . "
that 's a drastic view , but there 's no doubt that the resignation of the german president , horst koehler , on monday has delivered a major blow to the government .
it has many important issues to be dealing with : the crisis in the eurozone , the need for drastic savings , or the military involvement in afghanistan , to mention just a few .
and the government coalition , made up of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , has a few crises of its own : the poor showing of the two parties in the indecisive regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the sudden resignation of powerful regional leader roland koch in hessen , the internal backbiting within the liberal party , and disastrous opinion poll ratings .
so the chancellor , angela merkel , could well do without the scramble to find a convincing new president within 30 days , as required by the constitution .
is it a crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she regretted koehler 's departure and had tried to change his mind in a major interview on the evening of koehler 's resignation , she insisted , " we have to be sure not to make a crisis out of every challenge . "
but peter stuetzle , head of deutsche welle 's berlin office , thinks that a crisis is exactly what this is .
" this has been one too much for the government , " he says .
" there 's been a lot of trouble , and the government was just about to try to leave all that behind , and in this minute , koehler resigns . "
if the current government were doing well , the resignation would just be a nuisance , but it 's a sign of the government 's problems that the nuisance was immediately seen as a crisis .
all at sea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's coalition partners have already said they 'll leave the choice up to her wolfgang bosbach , a senior cdu backbencher , says that people do n't trust politicians of any party to solve the country 's problems , and so when respected figures like koehler or koch resign , the people feel that " the good people have left the ship , and we do n't how we will carry on in this rough sea . " what he , as a government supporter , fails to mention , is that , even if the people are disillusioned with all politicians , it 's his coalition which has the power to pilot the ship , and so that 's where the criticism hits particularly hard .
merkel has often been criticized for her lack of leadership - she tends to sit things out and wait until a consensus emerges - but the choice of a new president will require decisive action . peter stuetzle thinks the whole coalition has recognized the need .
her partners - not just the liberals , but also her bavarian sister-party , the csu - have agreed that they will do without their own candidates , and let her make the choice . " everything will be very fast , " he thinks , " and if it 's fast , and if it 's convincing too , then the government might even come out of the whole thing with a better public image at the end of the day . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 02.06.2010 german president 's resignation is a blow to the government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel probably never expected that koehler would cause a crisis for her the sudden resignation of the german president , horst koehler , is yet another challenge to a much-challenged government .
some analysts are saying the next days will be crucial for its future . in an editorial , the website of german public broadcaster zdf said " the fate of this -lsb- government -rsb- coalition will be decided in the next ten days . "
that 's a drastic view , but there 's no doubt that the resignation of the german president , horst koehler , on monday has delivered a major blow to the government .
it has many important issues to be dealing with : the crisis in the eurozone , the need for drastic savings , or the military involvement in afghanistan , to mention just a few .
and the government coalition , made up of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , has a few crises of its own : the poor showing of the two parties in the indecisive regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the sudden resignation of powerful regional leader roland koch in hessen , the internal backbiting within the liberal party , and disastrous opinion poll ratings .
so the chancellor , angela merkel , could well do without the scramble to find a convincing new president within 30 days , as required by the constitution .
is it a crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she regretted koehler 's departure and had tried to change his mind in a major interview on the evening of koehler 's resignation , she insisted , " we have to be sure not to make a crisis out of every challenge . "
but peter stuetzle , head of deutsche welle 's berlin office , thinks that a crisis is exactly what this is .
" this has been one too much for the government , " he says .
" there 's been a lot of trouble , and the government was just about to try to leave all that behind , and in this minute , koehler resigns . "
if the current government were doing well , the resignation would just be a nuisance , but it 's a sign of the government 's problems that the nuisance was immediately seen as a crisis .
all at sea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's coalition partners have already said they 'll leave the choice up to her wolfgang bosbach , a senior cdu backbencher , says that people do n't trust politicians of any party to solve the country 's problems , and so when respected figures like koehler or koch resign , the people feel that " the good people have left the ship , and we do n't how we will carry on in this rough sea . " what he , as a government supporter , fails to mention , is that , even if the people are disillusioned with all politicians , it 's his coalition which has the power to pilot the ship , and so that 's where the criticism hits particularly hard .
merkel has often been criticized for her lack of leadership - she tends to sit things out and wait until a consensus emerges - but the choice of a new president will require decisive action . peter stuetzle thinks the whole coalition has recognized the need .
her partners - not just the liberals , but also her bavarian sister-party , the csu - have agreed that they will do without their own candidates , and let her make the choice . " everything will be very fast , " he thinks , " and if it 's fast , and if it 's convincing too , then the government might even come out of the whole thing with a better public image at the end of the day . "

swedish foreign minister carl bildt was among the european leaders in sarajevo lending his support to some balkan nations bidding to join the eu .
" there are a number of countries where enthusiasm for enlargement is less than 100 percent these days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : germany searches for a new president german presidential election goes into third and final round of voting the role of the german president how germany 's president is elected christian wulff : the quiet modernizer africa -pipe- 02.06.2010 future of koehler 's african projects uncertain after resignation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler supported projects to foster connections between germany and africa during his six year tenure as germany ’ s president , horst koehler worked hard to put africa on the top of germany ’ s political agenda .
however , his surprise resignation may jeopardize the success of his african projects . as the german president , horst koehler travelled the world .
on state visits , people saw a president that was interested in different cultures and societies .
but koehler was always fond of one continent in particular : africa .
he did not overlook africa 's ills and when he described them , he did not mince his words either .
but with koehler having left office , there is a looming danger that africa will fall back to the bottom of the political agenda in germany again .
new german presidents usually do not continue projects started by their predecessors , because they want to set their own political focus .
in this case , it likely wo n't include africa .
that is a shame , say experts , because when it came to corruption , civil war or lack of political leadership , the former president said what he thought – even if he was addressing african heads of state at the african union 's assembly .
at the same time , he did not ignore the many positive signs on the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler dances with ghanian president john agyekum kufuor in 2007 " civil society is growing across africa .
more and more people refuse to give in to their destinies .
farmers come together to buy fertilizer or to build wells .
civil society groups fight against corruption and put their governments to task .
women take the initiative to built schools or clinics for aids patients , ” koehler once said in a speech .
whether it was praise or criticism – horst koehler 's main priority was to establish a dialogue of equals between africans and germans .
in his first speech to parliament in july 2004 , koehler made it clear that africa was a priority for him .
" it is my conviction that the humanity of our world will be measured against the fate of africa , " koehler told members of germany 's lower house , the bundestag .
imf legacy troublesome at first but most african leaders did not start cheering at his words right away .
" there were many people in africa in the beginning that automatically identified horst koehler with the international monetary fund , " said ulf engel , a scholar in the africa department of the university of leipzig .
koehler had been at the helm of the international monetary fund until he was elected president .
the fund is notorious in africa for koehler 's structural adjustment policies , cost-cutting measures aimed at reducing public debts .
the imf forced various african countries to introduce school fees or make visits to the hospital more expensive as part of structural adjustment .
but koehler soon managed to change his perception in africa through his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited a youth center in rwanda in 2008 “ he gained a lot of popularity in africa when he started his ' partnership with africa ' initiative , " said engel .
partnership with africa was koehler 's pet project .
it was his attempt to make a direct contribution to the establishment of a dialogue of equals in real life .
it was n't just members of germany 's and africa 's political and business elite who discussed topics such as the difficult relationship between africa and europe or the challenges faced by africa 's youth .
promising young people known as " future leaders " from africa and germany also always sat at the table .
all words , no action ?
critics sometimes commented that the meetings were just another talking shop .
they liked to complain that africa did not need more words , but action .
but as the university of leipzig 's engel says , koehler was able to consistently make a clear statement about the policies regarding africa .
" some politicians were clearly uncomfortable when he took a firm stand on issues that he felt the west needed to change .
a reduction of subsidies for western products for instance , or the need to take africa seriously , " engel said .
germany 's constitution did not give koehler much room to put his political ideas into practice .
according to the law , the president has little political power .
instead , he had to use the power of words to influence german politics , and that power was n't always enough .
“ it 's tragic that he did not manage to make politicians in berlin listen to him , " said engel .

however , his surprise resignation may jeopardize the success of his african projects . as the german president , horst koehler travelled the world .
on state visits , people saw a president that was interested in different cultures and societies .
but koehler was always fond of one continent in particular : africa .
he did not overlook africa 's ills and when he described them , he did not mince his words either .
but with koehler having left office , there is a looming danger that africa will fall back to the bottom of the political agenda in germany again .
new german presidents usually do not continue projects started by their predecessors , because they want to set their own political focus .
in this case , it likely wo n't include africa .
that is a shame , say experts , because when it came to corruption , civil war or lack of political leadership , the former president said what he thought – even if he was addressing african heads of state at the african union 's assembly .
at the same time , he did not ignore the many positive signs on the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler dances with ghanian president john agyekum kufuor in 2007 " civil society is growing across africa .

civil society groups fight against corruption and put their governments to task .
women take the initiative to built schools or clinics for aids patients , ” koehler once said in a speech .
whether it was praise or criticism – horst koehler 's main priority was to establish a dialogue of equals between africans and germans .
in his first speech to parliament in july 2004 , koehler made it clear that africa was a priority for him .
" it is my conviction that the humanity of our world will be measured against the fate of africa , " koehler told members of germany 's lower house , the bundestag .

" there were many people in africa in the beginning that automatically identified horst koehler with the international monetary fund , " said ulf engel , a scholar in the africa department of the university of leipzig .
koehler had been at the helm of the international monetary fund until he was elected president .
the fund is notorious in africa for koehler 's structural adjustment policies , cost-cutting measures aimed at reducing public debts .
the imf forced various african countries to introduce school fees or make visits to the hospital more expensive as part of structural adjustment .
but koehler soon managed to change his perception in africa through his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited a youth center in rwanda in 2008 “ he gained a lot of popularity in africa when he started his ' partnership with africa ' initiative , " said engel .
partnership with africa was koehler 's pet project .
it was his attempt to make a direct contribution to the establishment of a dialogue of equals in real life .
it was n't just members of germany 's and africa 's political and business elite who discussed topics such as the difficult relationship between africa and europe or the challenges faced by africa 's youth .
promising young people known as " future leaders " from africa and germany also always sat at the table .
all words , no action ?
critics sometimes commented that the meetings were just another talking shop .
they liked to complain that africa did not need more words , but action .
but as the university of leipzig 's engel says , koehler was able to consistently make a clear statement about the policies regarding africa .
" some politicians were clearly uncomfortable when he took a firm stand on issues that he felt the west needed to change .
a reduction of subsidies for western products for instance , or the need to take africa seriously , " engel said .
germany 's constitution did not give koehler much room to put his political ideas into practice .
according to the law , the president has little political power .
instead , he had to use the power of words to influence german politics , and that power was n't always enough .
“ it 's tragic that he did not manage to make politicians in berlin listen to him , " said engel .

however , his surprise resignation may jeopardize the success of his african projects . as the german president , horst koehler travelled the world .
on state visits , people saw a president that was interested in different cultures and societies .
but koehler was always fond of one continent in particular : africa .
he did not overlook africa 's ills and when he described them , he did not mince his words either .
but with koehler having left office , there is a looming danger that africa will fall back to the bottom of the political agenda in germany again .
new german presidents usually do not continue projects started by their predecessors , because they want to set their own political focus .
in this case , it likely wo n't include africa .
that is a shame , say experts , because when it came to corruption , civil war or lack of political leadership , the former president said what he thought – even if he was addressing african heads of state at the african union 's assembly .
at the same time , he did not ignore the many positive signs on the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler dances with ghanian president john agyekum kufuor in 2007 " civil society is growing across africa .
more and more people refuse to give in to their destinies .
farmers come together to buy fertilizer or to build wells .
civil society groups fight against corruption and put their governments to task .
women take the initiative to built schools or clinics for aids patients , ” koehler once said in a speech .
whether it was praise or criticism – horst koehler 's main priority was to establish a dialogue of equals between africans and germans .
in his first speech to parliament in july 2004 , koehler made it clear that africa was a priority for him .
" it is my conviction that the humanity of our world will be measured against the fate of africa , " koehler told members of germany 's lower house , the bundestag .
imf legacy troublesome at first but most african leaders did not start cheering at his words right away .
" there were many people in africa in the beginning that automatically identified horst koehler with the international monetary fund , " said ulf engel , a scholar in the africa department of the university of leipzig .
koehler had been at the helm of the international monetary fund until he was elected president .
the fund is notorious in africa for koehler 's structural adjustment policies , cost-cutting measures aimed at reducing public debts .
the imf forced various african countries to introduce school fees or make visits to the hospital more expensive as part of structural adjustment .
but koehler soon managed to change his perception in africa through his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited a youth center in rwanda in 2008 “ he gained a lot of popularity in africa when he started his ' partnership with africa ' initiative , " said engel .
partnership with africa was koehler 's pet project .
it was his attempt to make a direct contribution to the establishment of a dialogue of equals in real life .
it was n't just members of germany 's and africa 's political and business elite who discussed topics such as the difficult relationship between africa and europe or the challenges faced by africa 's youth .
promising young people known as " future leaders " from africa and germany also always sat at the table .
all words , no action ?
critics sometimes commented that the meetings were just another talking shop .
they liked to complain that africa did not need more words , but action .
but as the university of leipzig 's engel says , koehler was able to consistently make a clear statement about the policies regarding africa .
" some politicians were clearly uncomfortable when he took a firm stand on issues that he felt the west needed to change .
a reduction of subsidies for western products for instance , or the need to take africa seriously , " engel said .
germany 's constitution did not give koehler much room to put his political ideas into practice .
according to the law , the president has little political power .
instead , he had to use the power of words to influence german politics , and that power was n't always enough .
“ it 's tragic that he did not manage to make politicians in berlin listen to him , " said engel .

although polish and russian investigators have not made any final conclusions , transcripts of the black-box cockpit recorders seem to support the theory that pilot error and poor conditions led to the crash .
the plane carrying kacynski and 95 other people , among them high-ranking government officials , crashed as it came in for a landing at smolensk airport in russia .
despite warnings from russian air traffic controllers - which can be heard on the black-box recordings - the pilots decided to attempt a landing anyway .

the pilots then began normal landing procedures .
about two minutes before the crash , alarms indicating " terrain ahead " with warnings to " pull up " repeatedly sounded in the cockpit .
these warnings went unheeded by the pilots until it was too late .
no indication of pressure from passengers in the polish media it had been speculated that pressure on the pilots to land , possibly from kaczynski himself , had contributed to the tragedy .
kaczynski and his delegation were running late for a planned ceremony in the katyn forest that marked the murder of 22,000 poles 70 years ago .

kazana can also be heard saying that there had been " no decision from the president on what to do . "
the pilots seemed to think that their landing attempt would not be possible due to the weather and that they would have to pull up for another pass or land at a different airport .

although polish and russian investigators have not made any final conclusions , transcripts of the black-box cockpit recorders seem to support the theory that pilot error and poor conditions led to the crash .
the plane carrying kacynski and 95 other people , among them high-ranking government officials , crashed as it came in for a landing at smolensk airport in russia .
despite warnings from russian air traffic controllers - which can be heard on the black-box recordings - the pilots decided to attempt a landing anyway .

the pilots seemed to think that their landing attempt would not be possible due to the weather and that they would have to pull up for another pass or land at a different airport .
the last bit of audio recorded on the black box is the sound of the plane hitting a tree and an unidentified person in the cockpit cursing in polish .

the cinema was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago . marcus vetter made a film in jenin three years ago - and stayed on to build a cinema in which to show it .
his documentary film , " the heart of jenin , " is about ahmed khatib , a palestinian boy killed by israeli troops while playing with a toy gun in the town 's refugee camp .
his parents decided to donate their son 's organs to save the lives of other children - arab and israeli .
the documentary won several awards , but it could n't be shown in jenin , where it all happened .
the town 's only movie theater was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago .
ahmed 's parents asked vetter to help renovate and reopen it , because they wanted to create more opportunities for local children .
he agreed , although he 'd never funded or managed a building project before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcus vetter with one of the palestinian teens who 's been helping on the project " you ca n't open such a place just by helping .
it 's impossible as i realized very fast .
this is real work .
what i could have helped with was fundraising , but raising money is nothing - raising money just means corruption , " said vetter .
vetter has run things in an unorthodox way .
he did n't apply for funding before starting .
he just began , with no salaries at all to pay the german architects and engineers .
they 're volunteers .
" just take a step , that 's what we did here , just renovate , do n't talk all the time , and do it with all your passion , " said vetter .
the project is ambitious .
vetter and his team are renovating the old indoor cinema , building an outdoor one , adding a cafe and guest house , as well as setting up a film production and distribution company .
government , private donors covered costs so far , the project has cost more than half a million euros .
most of the money has come from the german government , with the rest from corporate donors and ordinary people .
along the way , money has always been tight .
earlier this year , vetter simply ran out of cash .
he wrote to six donors saying he needed 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- to finish the job .
only one of them replied - legendary british musician roger waters , of pink floyd fame .
" having met all the people involved i felt connected to them and i felt it was the least i could do to give them the money to finish the project , " said waters , talking by phone from the united states .
waters says he was inspired to help by the generosity of ahmed khatib 's father .
" this project was fundamentally and always attached to that story , that incredibly moving story .
he gives the rest of us hope that we may at some point find a partial solution to the plight the palestinian people find themselves in , " said waters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck delivers all the technical equipment to the cinema dialogue with other cultures fakhri hamad , the project manager for cinema jenin , says the project is changing the town .
" we started with a small idea to have a place for kids to play and learn but it 's had local and international support , and it 's grown and grown .
now it 's become a project of the town itself .
jenin has the chance to prove it 's ready to accept other cultures , to accept peace and to accept dialogue , " said hamad .
it 's been a huge turnaround for jenin , a town with a population of around 250,000 which became known as the source of a third of the suicide bombers of the palestinian uprising known as the second intifada .
now , young palestinians are learning about filmmaking side by side with german students , as well as working on the building site together .
opposition from intellectuals but there has been some palestinian opposition to the project .
earlier this year , palestinian intellectuals criticized cinema jenin , arguing that it " normalized " relations between palestinians and israel .
they said the project relied on cooperation with israel and that they opposed building a cinema while israel 's occupation army remained in the west bank .
vetter admits that he was discouraged .
" i did think then that the project might fail .
i thought that i ca n't keep giving my time to a project which has a fundamentalist approach .
it was very depressing , " said vetter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's still a long way to go on the building site but the faith of ordinary people in the project restored vetter 's commitment , as did the unswerving determination of ahmed khatib 's parents .
for them , cinema jenin is the fulfilment of a dream .
they want the town 's young people to have more of everything than their son had - more opportunities , more of a future , and of course more security .
when he died , ahmed saved the lives of the five children who received his organs .
with this movie theater , established in his memory , they hope he will touch the lives of countless more .
opening in time for world cup cinema jenin is now almost complete .
the members of the project team hope to open the outdoor cinema in time for the world cup later this month .
the official opening of the restored indoor cinema is scheduled for august .

the ban " concerns securities that registered on a regulated german market , " a finance ministry said .
the ban also encompasses certain trades on currencies that are not used for hedging purposes .
a previous version of the draft law had envisaged a complete ban on short selling currency derivates .
naked short is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
but unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy them back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether .
it is viewed as a far riskier form of trading .
the practice came under fire after greece struggled to raise capital to finance its debt .
naked trades were blamed for artificially inflating the country 's funding costs .
last month , germany stunned its international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide with its plan to temporarily ban naked short selling of some financial shares , sovereign debt bonds and credit default swaps .
after berlin announced its ban last month , christoph schmidt , head of germany 's rwi economics institute , referred to the move as " an isolated step in a globalized world " and doubted it would have an impact .
indeed , most short selling takes place in london ; it is not a common practice in germany .
the draft bill must still be approved by the lower house of german parliament , the bundestag , where chancellor merkel 's coalition government holds a majority .
the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , can delay the bill but not block it indefinitely .

naked short is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 02.06.2010 turkey and us face tough decisions on relations after israeli flotilla raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as turkey 's relations with israel dive , ankara looks to the us while its relations with israel continue to plummet to new depths in the wake of the gaza flotilla raid , turkey is considering how to handle the us as washington tries to balance its ties with jerusalem and ankara . few countries are more enraged by israel 's raid on the gaza aid flotilla than turkey .
much of the action during monday 's pre-dawn raid by israeli commandos was focused on a turkish-flagged ship and at least four of the nine fatalities arising from the attack were pro-palestinian turks . in the days following , relations between turkey and israel have been strained to breaking point with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan calling the raid a " bloody massacre " and accusing israel of " unacceptable lawlessness . " erdogan has even gone so far as to refer to israel - a close partner since diplomatic ties with the jewish state were established in 1949 - as " a festering boil in the middle east that spreads hate and enmity , dynamites regional peace and spreads instability . " in such a situation , it is unsurprising that relations between turkey and israel are currently plummeting to an all-time low , even lower than when the relationship soured over israel 's military operations in gaza in 2008 .
but experts are also watching closely how relations between turkey and israel 's most powerful ally – the united states – will develop as the shockwaves from the flotilla raid ripple on . a furious erdogan wasted no time calling us president barack obama after the incident . " israel is faced with the danger of losing its sole friend in the region and the greatest contributor so far to regional peace , " erdogan told the us president in a one-hour telephone conversation , according to a turkish government statement on wednesday . bildunterschrift : erdogan suggested that turkey could abandon israel but trade and military ties remain too strong turkey-israel ties ' too strong to break ' turkey has been israel 's chief regional ally since a military cooperation deal was signed between the two countries in 1996 .
however , some sections of the us media claim the implication behind erdogan 's statement is that turkey , with its mainly muslim population , could shift its allegiance towards its new-found friends in the arab world , partners which the islamist-rooted government in ankara have been courting for some time . joost lagendijk , a senior advisor at the istanbul policy center , disagrees .
he believes that the connections between turkey and israel are too strong to be severed . " while we will see the two sides divided at an official , political level , turkey and israel will still have strong military and business ties , " he told deutsche welle . " it makes good sense to have good relations with the arabs but rejecting israel for the arabs is not a viable alternative . " while relations – especially those concerning trade – have been improving over the past few years with a host of arab nations , including syria , iran , lebanon and jordan , turkey still has its eyes set on europe and eu membership .
the european union is still the main power that turkey trusts most in the international arena , despite the eu 's continued ambivalence towards ankara 's accession hopes . however , some observers claim that the israeli raid offers turkey an opportunity to dangle the possibility of an eastward shift in the face of the united states to gain some leverage in a number of issues .
joost lagendijk believes it would be foolish to do so . " turkey 's standing in the middle east and its dealing with its arab partners are only possible because it has such good connections with both the us and the eu , ” he said .
“ that 's what makes turkey such an interesting partner to the arabs .
what would the value of turkey be without that ? " steven cook , a middle east expert at the council on foreign relations , believes turkey will pursue its own goals in the middle east and wo n't feel the need to pressure the us into supporting it . " turkey has economic , political and strategic interests in the arab middle east and turkish leaders obviously feel less inhibited to pursue their own interests in the region , regardless of washington 's wishes , " he told deutsche welle .
" the turks are willing to bend the regional rules of the game to serve ankara 's own interests .
if the resulting policies serve us goals at the same time , all well and good .
if not , so be it . " the united states may be closely watching turkey 's growing connection to regional arab powers but is unlikely to feel any threat from its closer ties with the likes of iran and syria .
despite its ambitions , turkey 's current economic and strategic power is still not enough to project discernible influence in the middle east and it still requires good relations with the us and eu to add weight to its status in the region . us looking to keep muslim ally turkey on side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain good relations with turkey bilateral relations by their nature have mutual benefits and turkey is n't the only partner seeking support .
the united states sees turkey as a key muslim ally and the obama administration has been working hard to repair the damage to relations caused by the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion . since then , the us and turkey have set-up intelligence sharing networks in the on-going fight against international terrorism while turkey hosts the us military infrastructure needed for its missions in neighbouring iraq and afghanistan . " turkey is still a key muslim ally to the us and is a favorite partner , one which is held up as an example of a predominantly islamic country with a growing democracy , " joost lagendijk said .
" the us wo n't want to jeapordise that .
if it turns on turkey for any reason , then the whole rhetoric washington has created about reforming the islamic world will crumble . " despite this , steven cook says , the two nations are increasingly finding themselves at odds with each other . " washington and ankara do share the same goals : peace between israel and the palestinians ; a stable , unified iraq ; an iran without nuclear weapons ; stability in afghanistan ; and a western-oriented syria , " he said . " when you get down to details , however , washington and ankara are on the opposite ends of virtually all these issues . " but after six decades of strategic cooperation , the stark reality is that while turkey and the united states are not enemies in the middle east , they are fast becoming strategic competitors . " turkey is asserting itself more in the middle east , where it has gone from a tepid observer to an influential player in eight short years , " cook added . washington faces balancing act with ankara , jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ties with israel will impact on its relations with turkey while turkey and the united states will not want to fall out , the situation arising from the israeli flotilla raid may still give turkey an opportunity to press its own agenda while maintaining strong ties with the us .
as pressure from the international community grows , turkey currently stands a greater chance at getting its own way over ending the blockade of gaza " the world has woken up to the gaza situation and now it is not only turkey calling for the end of the blockade , ” lagendijk said .
“ turkey , if it is clever , can use this to pressure the us which itself is growing more frustrated with the netanyahu government in israel .
maybe this will lead to the us calling for an end to the embargo . " author : nick amies editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" israel is faced with the danger of losing its sole friend in the region and the greatest contributor so far to regional peace , " erdogan told the us president in a one-hour telephone conversation , according to a turkish government statement on wednesday . bildunterschrift : erdogan suggested that turkey could abandon israel but trade and military ties remain too strong turkey-israel ties ' too strong to break ' turkey has been israel 's chief regional ally since a military cooperation deal was signed between the two countries in 1996 .
however , some sections of the us media claim the implication behind erdogan 's statement is that turkey , with its mainly muslim population , could shift its allegiance towards its new-found friends in the arab world , partners which the islamist-rooted government in ankara have been courting for some time . joost lagendijk , a senior advisor at the istanbul policy center , disagrees .
he believes that the connections between turkey and israel are too strong to be severed . " while we will see the two sides divided at an official , political level , turkey and israel will still have strong military and business ties , " he told deutsche welle . " it makes good sense to have good relations with the arabs but rejecting israel for the arabs is not a viable alternative . " while relations – especially those concerning trade – have been improving over the past few years with a host of arab nations , including syria , iran , lebanon and jordan , turkey still has its eyes set on europe and eu membership .
the european union is still the main power that turkey trusts most in the international arena , despite the eu 's continued ambivalence towards ankara 's accession hopes . however , some observers claim that the israeli raid offers turkey an opportunity to dangle the possibility of an eastward shift in the face of the united states to gain some leverage in a number of issues .
joost lagendijk believes it would be foolish to do so . " turkey 's standing in the middle east and its dealing with its arab partners are only possible because it has such good connections with both the us and the eu , ” he said .
“ that 's what makes turkey such an interesting partner to the arabs .
what would the value of turkey be without that ? " steven cook , a middle east expert at the council on foreign relations , believes turkey will pursue its own goals in the middle east and wo n't feel the need to pressure the us into supporting it . " turkey has economic , political and strategic interests in the arab middle east and turkish leaders obviously feel less inhibited to pursue their own interests in the region , regardless of washington 's wishes , " he told deutsche welle .
" the turks are willing to bend the regional rules of the game to serve ankara 's own interests .
if the resulting policies serve us goals at the same time , all well and good .
if not , so be it . " the united states may be closely watching turkey 's growing connection to regional arab powers but is unlikely to feel any threat from its closer ties with the likes of iran and syria .
despite its ambitions , turkey 's current economic and strategic power is still not enough to project discernible influence in the middle east and it still requires good relations with the us and eu to add weight to its status in the region . us looking to keep muslim ally turkey on side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain good relations with turkey bilateral relations by their nature have mutual benefits and turkey is n't the only partner seeking support .
the united states sees turkey as a key muslim ally and the obama administration has been working hard to repair the damage to relations caused by the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion . since then , the us and turkey have set-up intelligence sharing networks in the on-going fight against international terrorism while turkey hosts the us military infrastructure needed for its missions in neighbouring iraq and afghanistan . " turkey is still a key muslim ally to the us and is a favorite partner , one which is held up as an example of a predominantly islamic country with a growing democracy , " joost lagendijk said .
" the us wo n't want to jeapordise that .
if it turns on turkey for any reason , then the whole rhetoric washington has created about reforming the islamic world will crumble . " despite this , steven cook says , the two nations are increasingly finding themselves at odds with each other . " washington and ankara do share the same goals : peace between israel and the palestinians ; a stable , unified iraq ; an iran without nuclear weapons ; stability in afghanistan ; and a western-oriented syria , " he said . " when you get down to details , however , washington and ankara are on the opposite ends of virtually all these issues . " but after six decades of strategic cooperation , the stark reality is that while turkey and the united states are not enemies in the middle east , they are fast becoming strategic competitors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 02.06.2010 european commission plans reform of rating agency regulation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies are blamed for worsening the financial crisis credit rating agencies in the european union could soon be subject to new operating regulations , but some analysts fear that too much regulation will stifle competition in an sector already under a virtual oligopoly . the european commission on wednesday unveiled new proposals for regulating credit rating agencies -lrb- cras -rrb- , which some analysts blame for exacerbating the turmoil in european financial markets .
the new guidelines provide stricter transparency guidelines , and place cra regulation under the authority of the european securities and markets authority -lrb- esma -rrb- , which the commission established last year and is due to come into force at the start of 2011 .
the esma would have the authority to impose sanctions on agencies , and even withdraw their licenses when they fail to comply with regulations .
the three main credit rating agencies , standard & poor 's , moody 's and fitch , had operated with significant latitude before the eu began issuing licenses and demanding a certain level of transparency just last year , according to karel lannoo , director of the european credit research institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lowered bond ratings have made it hard for greece to finance its budget " when the financial crisis started in 2007 , it was very clear that the ratings which the rating agencies gave were not based on pure objective facts , " he told deutsche welle .
" there were huge conflicts of interest .
that 's why the eu was then convinced that there should be a piece of regulation . "
case for regulation one function of rating agencies is to rate the risk of government bonds , using a scale of aaa for the most secure to d for an almost certain default .
the agencies then sell these ratings to investors and banks .
the conflict of interest appears when the agencies rate the very institutions that buy their services , said robert halver , stock analyst for baader bank .
" the rating agencies finance themselves very strongly with the sale of analytical instruments on pension funds , insurance agencies and banks , because everyone assumes that they have a lot of knowledge about country 's risks , " he told deutsche welle .
another reason for further regulation is the role cras have played in crises related to the public finance of budgets , most notably in greece but also in spain , portugal and italy , said lannoo .
when ratings agencies devalue government bonds , it creates a problem of " systemic stability . "

the new guidelines provide stricter transparency guidelines , and place cra regulation under the authority of the european securities and markets authority -lrb- esma -rrb- , which the commission established last year and is due to come into force at the start of 2011 .
the esma would have the authority to impose sanctions on agencies , and even withdraw their licenses when they fail to comply with regulations .
the three main credit rating agencies , standard & poor 's , moody 's and fitch , had operated with significant latitude before the eu began issuing licenses and demanding a certain level of transparency just last year , according to karel lannoo , director of the european credit research institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lowered bond ratings have made it hard for greece to finance its budget " when the financial crisis started in 2007 , it was very clear that the ratings which the rating agencies gave were not based on pure objective facts , " he told deutsche welle .
" there were huge conflicts of interest .
that 's why the eu was then convinced that there should be a piece of regulation . "
case for regulation one function of rating agencies is to rate the risk of government bonds , using a scale of aaa for the most secure to d for an almost certain default .
the agencies then sell these ratings to investors and banks .
the conflict of interest appears when the agencies rate the very institutions that buy their services , said robert halver , stock analyst for baader bank .
" the rating agencies finance themselves very strongly with the sale of analytical instruments on pension funds , insurance agencies and banks , because everyone assumes that they have a lot of knowledge about country 's risks , " he told deutsche welle .
another reason for further regulation is the role cras have played in crises related to the public finance of budgets , most notably in greece but also in spain , portugal and italy , said lannoo .
when ratings agencies devalue government bonds , it creates a problem of " systemic stability . "
" all of a sudden these ratings agencies have drastically downgraded the debt of these countries , which as given rise to systemic effects , in the sense that many investors have started to sell the securities or the bonds of these countries , " he said .

the accusations are in connection with the hiring of a priest alleged to have been a sex offender in the 1980s . german prosecutors announced on wednesday that they were investigating claims that the head of the german bishops ' conference , robert zollitsch , aided and abetted a known sex offender in the church .
prosecutors said that they had received information indicating that , while zollitsch was in charge of the personnel department of a diocese in southern germany in 1987 , he appointed a priest who was known to have abused children .
the archdiocese of freiburg has released a statement denying that zollitsch was responsible for the appointment .
aiding and abetting prosecutors confirmed that they had launched an investigation , following reports by public broadcaster ard and the suedkurier newspaper .
the freiburg archdiocese has described the media reports as " absolutely weak " and " sensationalist . "
in 1987 zollitsch was head of the human resources department of the diocese of freiburg .
he is accused of rehiring a priest accused of sexually abusing children in a monestary in the 1960s .
the diocese says that the appointment was entirely in the hands of the monastery 's abbot , and that zollitsch neither knew of the original allegations nor the subsequent re-appointment .

the accusations are in connection with the hiring of a priest alleged to have been a sex offender in the 1980s . german prosecutors announced on wednesday that they were investigating claims that the head of the german bishops ' conference , robert zollitsch , aided and abetted a known sex offender in the church .
prosecutors said that they had received information indicating that , while zollitsch was in charge of the personnel department of a diocese in southern germany in 1987 , he appointed a priest who was known to have abused children .
the archdiocese of freiburg has released a statement denying that zollitsch was responsible for the appointment .
aiding and abetting prosecutors confirmed that they had launched an investigation , following reports by public broadcaster ard and the suedkurier newspaper .
the freiburg archdiocese has described the media reports as " absolutely weak " and " sensationalist . "
in 1987 zollitsch was head of the human resources department of the diocese of freiburg .
he is accused of rehiring a priest accused of sexually abusing children in a monestary in the 1960s .
the diocese says that the appointment was entirely in the hands of the monastery 's abbot , and that zollitsch neither knew of the original allegations nor the subsequent re-appointment .
part of a wider scandal sexual abuse scandals have rocked the church in germany since january , when dozens of cases emerged involving allegations of the sexual molestation of minors by priests and other clergy over a period of 50 years at catholic schools .
as head of the bishops ' conference , zollitsch has been at the forefront of the catholic church 's response to the ongoing reports of abuse .

the new guidelines provide stricter transparency guidelines , and place cra regulation under the authority of the european securities and markets authority -lrb- esma -rrb- , which the commission established last year and is due to come into force at the start of 2011 .
the esma would have the authority to impose sanctions on agencies , and even withdraw their licenses when they fail to comply with regulations .
the three main credit rating agencies , standard & poor 's , moody 's and fitch , had operated with significant latitude before the eu began issuing licenses and demanding a certain level of transparency just last year , according to karel lannoo , director of the european credit research institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lowered bond ratings have made it hard for greece to finance its budget " when the financial crisis started in 2007 , it was very clear that the ratings which the rating agencies gave were not based on pure objective facts , " he told deutsche welle .
" there were huge conflicts of interest .
that 's why the eu was then convinced that there should be a piece of regulation . "
case for regulation one function of rating agencies is to rate the risk of government bonds , using a scale of aaa for the most secure to d for an almost certain default .
the agencies then sell these ratings to investors and banks .
the conflict of interest appears when the agencies rate the very institutions that buy their services , said robert halver , stock analyst for baader bank .
" the rating agencies finance themselves very strongly with the sale of analytical instruments on pension funds , insurance agencies and banks , because everyone assumes that they have a lot of knowledge about country 's risks , " he told deutsche welle .
another reason for further regulation is the role cras have played in crises related to the public finance of budgets , most notably in greece but also in spain , portugal and italy , said lannoo .
when ratings agencies devalue government bonds , it creates a problem of " systemic stability . "
" all of a sudden these ratings agencies have drastically downgraded the debt of these countries , which as given rise to systemic effects , in the sense that many investors have started to sell the securities or the bonds of these countries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker has proposed a new cra close to the european central bank more competition halver said one solution to europe 's problem with cras would be the creation of a european rating agency to compete with the " big three , " as long as it was n't under the supervision of a public entity like the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- or the european commission , as eurogroup president jean-claude juncker recently suggested .
" then there would be suspicion that they would exercise their influence and try to sugarcoat negative evaluations , " he said .
" that can not happen . "
lannoo said the big three already have a european component in fitch , whose main shareholder is european .
rather than constructing a new european rating agency , he said regulators should instead make it easier for already-existing agencies to be licensed as cras .
" what in fact we need to do is ... to lower the entry barriers into the sector , " he said .
" but what we in fact have done with this european regulation now is just the opposite - we have increased the entry thresholds because it 's extremely difficult to be in line with this piece of regulation . "

in 2009 , von der leyen became germany 's new labor minister after franz josef jung resigned .
her new post has seen her popularity undiminished as the german labor market seemed to withstand the expected downturn in the wake of the global economic crisis .

when asked whether she would be interested in the job , von der leyen avoided any concrete statements of intent but there 's little doubt she has the confidence to take over from horst koehler .
" we now need to find a good solution for the country under extreme time pressure , " she said .
" i think it 's very important that the president enjoys a high level of trust from the people . "
von der leyen started her political career rather late but quickly rose through the party ranks .
it was not until 1990 that she joined the conservative christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
she first studied economics and later medicine before going on to work as a doctor and in research .
she entered local politics in 1991 and less than two years later was elected into the state parliament of lower saxony , where became minister for social affairs .
in 2005 chancellor angela merkel took her to berlin to become family minister .

she successfully fought for a modern , social familiy policy to give , for example , single mothers better career chances .
in 2009 , von der leyen became germany 's new labor minister after franz josef jung resigned .
her new post has seen her popularity undiminished as the german labor market seemed to withstand the expected downturn in the wake of the global economic crisis .
initial opinion polls suggest that von der leyen is the politician who can muster more popular support than any of the other possible successors to koehler .
40 percent of the population are in favor of a woman taking over the country 's most senior post , while 25 percent would like to see von der leyen herself take over .
the post of president is largely ceremonial in germany , and the incumbent usually abstains from commenting on party politics .
the president is however expected to act as a moral authority in wider national debates .
popular and political backing born in 1958 , von der leyen hails from a family with a longstanding tradition in politics .
her father was former state premier of lower saxony ernst albrecht , who also worked in brussels for the eu 's predecessor , the european community .
von der leyen spent the first few years of her life in belgium .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 02.06.2010 european commission plans reform of rating agency regulation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies are blamed for worsening the financial crisis credit rating agencies in the european union could soon be subject to new operating regulations , but some analysts fear that too much regulation will stifle competition in an sector already under a virtual oligopoly . the european commission on wednesday unveiled new proposals for regulating credit rating agencies -lrb- cras -rrb- , which some analysts blame for exacerbating the turmoil in european financial markets .
the new guidelines provide stricter transparency guidelines , and place cra regulation under the authority of the european securities and markets authority -lrb- esma -rrb- , which the commission established last year and is due to come into force at the start of 2011 .
the esma would have the authority to impose sanctions on agencies , and even withdraw their licenses when they fail to comply with regulations .
the three main credit rating agencies , standard & poor 's , moody 's and fitch , had operated with significant latitude before the eu began issuing licenses and demanding a certain level of transparency just last year , according to karel lannoo , director of the european credit research institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lowered bond ratings have made it hard for greece to finance its budget " when the financial crisis started in 2007 , it was very clear that the ratings which the rating agencies gave were not based on pure objective facts , " he told deutsche welle .
" there were huge conflicts of interest .
that 's why the eu was then convinced that there should be a piece of regulation . "
case for regulation one function of rating agencies is to rate the risk of government bonds , using a scale of aaa for the most secure to d for an almost certain default .
the agencies then sell these ratings to investors and banks .
the conflict of interest appears when the agencies rate the very institutions that buy their services , said robert halver , stock analyst for baader bank .
" the rating agencies finance themselves very strongly with the sale of analytical instruments on pension funds , insurance agencies and banks , because everyone assumes that they have a lot of knowledge about country 's risks , " he told deutsche welle .
another reason for further regulation is the role cras have played in crises related to the public finance of budgets , most notably in greece but also in spain , portugal and italy , said lannoo .
when ratings agencies devalue government bonds , it creates a problem of " systemic stability . "
" all of a sudden these ratings agencies have drastically downgraded the debt of these countries , which as given rise to systemic effects , in the sense that many investors have started to sell the securities or the bonds of these countries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker has proposed a new cra close to the european central bank more competition halver said one solution to europe 's problem with cras would be the creation of a european rating agency to compete with the " big three , " as long as it was n't under the supervision of a public entity like the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- or the european commission , as eurogroup president jean-claude juncker recently suggested .
" then there would be suspicion that they would exercise their influence and try to sugarcoat negative evaluations , " he said .
" that can not happen . "
lannoo said the big three already have a european component in fitch , whose main shareholder is european .
rather than constructing a new european rating agency , he said regulators should instead make it easier for already-existing agencies to be licensed as cras .
" what in fact we need to do is ... to lower the entry barriers into the sector , " he said .
" but what we in fact have done with this european regulation now is just the opposite - we have increased the entry thresholds because it 's extremely difficult to be in line with this piece of regulation . "

case for regulation one function of rating agencies is to rate the risk of government bonds , using a scale of aaa for the most secure to d for an almost certain default .
the agencies then sell these ratings to investors and banks .
the conflict of interest appears when the agencies rate the very institutions that buy their services , said robert halver , stock analyst for baader bank .
" the rating agencies finance themselves very strongly with the sale of analytical instruments on pension funds , insurance agencies and banks , because everyone assumes that they have a lot of knowledge about country 's risks , " he told deutsche welle .
another reason for further regulation is the role cras have played in crises related to the public finance of budgets , most notably in greece but also in spain , portugal and italy , said lannoo .
when ratings agencies devalue government bonds , it creates a problem of " systemic stability . "
" all of a sudden these ratings agencies have drastically downgraded the debt of these countries , which as given rise to systemic effects , in the sense that many investors have started to sell the securities or the bonds of these countries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker has proposed a new cra close to the european central bank more competition halver said one solution to europe 's problem with cras would be the creation of a european rating agency to compete with the " big three , " as long as it was n't under the supervision of a public entity like the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- or the european commission , as eurogroup president jean-claude juncker recently suggested .
" then there would be suspicion that they would exercise their influence and try to sugarcoat negative evaluations , " he said .
" that can not happen . "
lannoo said the big three already have a european component in fitch , whose main shareholder is european .
rather than constructing a new european rating agency , he said regulators should instead make it easier for already-existing agencies to be licensed as cras .
" what in fact we need to do is ... to lower the entry barriers into the sector , " he said .
" but what we in fact have done with this european regulation now is just the opposite - we have increased the entry thresholds because it 's extremely difficult to be in line with this piece of regulation . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 02.06.2010 turkey and us face tough decisions on relations after israeli flotilla raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as turkey 's relations with israel dive , ankara looks to the us while its relations with israel continue to plummet to new depths in the wake of the gaza flotilla raid , turkey is considering how to handle the us as washington tries to balance its ties with jerusalem and ankara . few countries are more enraged by israel 's raid on the gaza aid flotilla than turkey .
much of the action during monday 's pre-dawn raid by israeli commandos was focused on a turkish-flagged ship and at least four of the nine fatalities arising from the attack were pro-palestinian turks . in the days following , relations between turkey and israel have been strained to breaking point with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan calling the raid a " bloody massacre " and accusing israel of " unacceptable lawlessness . " erdogan has even gone so far as to refer to israel - a close partner since diplomatic ties with the jewish state were established in 1949 - as " a festering boil in the middle east that spreads hate and enmity , dynamites regional peace and spreads instability . " in such a situation , it is unsurprising that relations between turkey and israel are currently plummeting to an all-time low , even lower than when the relationship soured over israel 's military operations in gaza in 2008 .
but experts are also watching closely how relations between turkey and israel 's most powerful ally – the united states – will develop as the shockwaves from the flotilla raid ripple on . a furious erdogan wasted no time calling us president barack obama after the incident . " israel is faced with the danger of losing its sole friend in the region and the greatest contributor so far to regional peace , " erdogan told the us president in a one-hour telephone conversation , according to a turkish government statement on wednesday . bildunterschrift : erdogan suggested that turkey could abandon israel but trade and military ties remain too strong turkey-israel ties ' too strong to break ' turkey has been israel 's chief regional ally since a military cooperation deal was signed between the two countries in 1996 .
however , some sections of the us media claim the implication behind erdogan 's statement is that turkey , with its mainly muslim population , could shift its allegiance towards its new-found friends in the arab world , partners which the islamist-rooted government in ankara have been courting for some time . joost lagendijk , a senior advisor at the istanbul policy center , disagrees .
he believes that the connections between turkey and israel are too strong to be severed . " while we will see the two sides divided at an official , political level , turkey and israel will still have strong military and business ties , " he told deutsche welle . " it makes good sense to have good relations with the arabs but rejecting israel for the arabs is not a viable alternative . " while relations – especially those concerning trade – have been improving over the past few years with a host of arab nations , including syria , iran , lebanon and jordan , turkey still has its eyes set on europe and eu membership .
the european union is still the main power that turkey trusts most in the international arena , despite the eu 's continued ambivalence towards ankara 's accession hopes . however , some observers claim that the israeli raid offers turkey an opportunity to dangle the possibility of an eastward shift in the face of the united states to gain some leverage in a number of issues .
joost lagendijk believes it would be foolish to do so . " turkey 's standing in the middle east and its dealing with its arab partners are only possible because it has such good connections with both the us and the eu , ” he said .
“ that 's what makes turkey such an interesting partner to the arabs .
what would the value of turkey be without that ? " steven cook , a middle east expert at the council on foreign relations , believes turkey will pursue its own goals in the middle east and wo n't feel the need to pressure the us into supporting it . " turkey has economic , political and strategic interests in the arab middle east and turkish leaders obviously feel less inhibited to pursue their own interests in the region , regardless of washington 's wishes , " he told deutsche welle .
" the turks are willing to bend the regional rules of the game to serve ankara 's own interests .
if the resulting policies serve us goals at the same time , all well and good .
if not , so be it . " the united states may be closely watching turkey 's growing connection to regional arab powers but is unlikely to feel any threat from its closer ties with the likes of iran and syria .
despite its ambitions , turkey 's current economic and strategic power is still not enough to project discernible influence in the middle east and it still requires good relations with the us and eu to add weight to its status in the region . us looking to keep muslim ally turkey on side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain good relations with turkey bilateral relations by their nature have mutual benefits and turkey is n't the only partner seeking support .
the united states sees turkey as a key muslim ally and the obama administration has been working hard to repair the damage to relations caused by the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion . since then , the us and turkey have set-up intelligence sharing networks in the on-going fight against international terrorism while turkey hosts the us military infrastructure needed for its missions in neighbouring iraq and afghanistan . " turkey is still a key muslim ally to the us and is a favorite partner , one which is held up as an example of a predominantly islamic country with a growing democracy , " joost lagendijk said .
" the us wo n't want to jeapordise that .
if it turns on turkey for any reason , then the whole rhetoric washington has created about reforming the islamic world will crumble . " despite this , steven cook says , the two nations are increasingly finding themselves at odds with each other . " washington and ankara do share the same goals : peace between israel and the palestinians ; a stable , unified iraq ; an iran without nuclear weapons ; stability in afghanistan ; and a western-oriented syria , " he said . " when you get down to details , however , washington and ankara are on the opposite ends of virtually all these issues . " but after six decades of strategic cooperation , the stark reality is that while turkey and the united states are not enemies in the middle east , they are fast becoming strategic competitors . " turkey is asserting itself more in the middle east , where it has gone from a tepid observer to an influential player in eight short years , " cook added . washington faces balancing act with ankara , jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ties with israel will impact on its relations with turkey while turkey and the united states will not want to fall out , the situation arising from the israeli flotilla raid may still give turkey an opportunity to press its own agenda while maintaining strong ties with the us .
as pressure from the international community grows , turkey currently stands a greater chance at getting its own way over ending the blockade of gaza " the world has woken up to the gaza situation and now it is not only turkey calling for the end of the blockade , ” lagendijk said .
“ turkey , if it is clever , can use this to pressure the us which itself is growing more frustrated with the netanyahu government in israel .
maybe this will lead to the us calling for an end to the embargo . " author : nick amies editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

much of the action during monday 's pre-dawn raid by israeli commandos was focused on a turkish-flagged ship and at least four of the nine fatalities arising from the attack were pro-palestinian turks . in the days following , relations between turkey and israel have been strained to breaking point with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan calling the raid a " bloody massacre " and accusing israel of " unacceptable lawlessness . " erdogan has even gone so far as to refer to israel - a close partner since diplomatic ties with the jewish state were established in 1949 - as " a festering boil in the middle east that spreads hate and enmity , dynamites regional peace and spreads instability . " in such a situation , it is unsurprising that relations between turkey and israel are currently plummeting to an all-time low , even lower than when the relationship soured over israel 's military operations in gaza in 2008 .
but experts are also watching closely how relations between turkey and israel 's most powerful ally – the united states – will develop as the shockwaves from the flotilla raid ripple on . a furious erdogan wasted no time calling us president barack obama after the incident . " israel is faced with the danger of losing its sole friend in the region and the greatest contributor so far to regional peace , " erdogan told the us president in a one-hour telephone conversation , according to a turkish government statement on wednesday . bildunterschrift : erdogan suggested that turkey could abandon israel but trade and military ties remain too strong turkey-israel ties ' too strong to break ' turkey has been israel 's chief regional ally since a military cooperation deal was signed between the two countries in 1996 .
however , some sections of the us media claim the implication behind erdogan 's statement is that turkey , with its mainly muslim population , could shift its allegiance towards its new-found friends in the arab world , partners which the islamist-rooted government in ankara have been courting for some time . joost lagendijk , a senior advisor at the istanbul policy center , disagrees .
he believes that the connections between turkey and israel are too strong to be severed . " while we will see the two sides divided at an official , political level , turkey and israel will still have strong military and business ties , " he told deutsche welle . " it makes good sense to have good relations with the arabs but rejecting israel for the arabs is not a viable alternative . " while relations – especially those concerning trade – have been improving over the past few years with a host of arab nations , including syria , iran , lebanon and jordan , turkey still has its eyes set on europe and eu membership .
the european union is still the main power that turkey trusts most in the international arena , despite the eu 's continued ambivalence towards ankara 's accession hopes . however , some observers claim that the israeli raid offers turkey an opportunity to dangle the possibility of an eastward shift in the face of the united states to gain some leverage in a number of issues .
joost lagendijk believes it would be foolish to do so . " turkey 's standing in the middle east and its dealing with its arab partners are only possible because it has such good connections with both the us and the eu , ” he said .
“ that 's what makes turkey such an interesting partner to the arabs .
what would the value of turkey be without that ? " steven cook , a middle east expert at the council on foreign relations , believes turkey will pursue its own goals in the middle east and wo n't feel the need to pressure the us into supporting it . " turkey has economic , political and strategic interests in the arab middle east and turkish leaders obviously feel less inhibited to pursue their own interests in the region , regardless of washington 's wishes , " he told deutsche welle .
" the turks are willing to bend the regional rules of the game to serve ankara 's own interests .
if the resulting policies serve us goals at the same time , all well and good .
if not , so be it . " the united states may be closely watching turkey 's growing connection to regional arab powers but is unlikely to feel any threat from its closer ties with the likes of iran and syria .
despite its ambitions , turkey 's current economic and strategic power is still not enough to project discernible influence in the middle east and it still requires good relations with the us and eu to add weight to its status in the region . us looking to keep muslim ally turkey on side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain good relations with turkey bilateral relations by their nature have mutual benefits and turkey is n't the only partner seeking support .
the united states sees turkey as a key muslim ally and the obama administration has been working hard to repair the damage to relations caused by the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion . since then , the us and turkey have set-up intelligence sharing networks in the on-going fight against international terrorism while turkey hosts the us military infrastructure needed for its missions in neighbouring iraq and afghanistan . " turkey is still a key muslim ally to the us and is a favorite partner , one which is held up as an example of a predominantly islamic country with a growing democracy , " joost lagendijk said .
" the us wo n't want to jeapordise that .
if it turns on turkey for any reason , then the whole rhetoric washington has created about reforming the islamic world will crumble . " despite this , steven cook says , the two nations are increasingly finding themselves at odds with each other . " washington and ankara do share the same goals : peace between israel and the palestinians ; a stable , unified iraq ; an iran without nuclear weapons ; stability in afghanistan ; and a western-oriented syria , " he said . " when you get down to details , however , washington and ankara are on the opposite ends of virtually all these issues . " but after six decades of strategic cooperation , the stark reality is that while turkey and the united states are not enemies in the middle east , they are fast becoming strategic competitors . " turkey is asserting itself more in the middle east , where it has gone from a tepid observer to an influential player in eight short years , " cook added . washington faces balancing act with ankara , jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ties with israel will impact on its relations with turkey while turkey and the united states will not want to fall out , the situation arising from the israeli flotilla raid may still give turkey an opportunity to press its own agenda while maintaining strong ties with the us .
as pressure from the international community grows , turkey currently stands a greater chance at getting its own way over ending the blockade of gaza " the world has woken up to the gaza situation and now it is not only turkey calling for the end of the blockade , ” lagendijk said .
“ turkey , if it is clever , can use this to pressure the us which itself is growing more frustrated with the netanyahu government in israel .
maybe this will lead to the us calling for an end to the embargo . " author : nick amies editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cinema was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago . marcus vetter made a film in jenin three years ago - and stayed on to build a cinema in which to show it .
his documentary film , " the heart of jenin , " is about ahmed khatib , a palestinian boy killed by israeli troops while playing with a toy gun in the town 's refugee camp .
his parents decided to donate their son 's organs to save the lives of other children - arab and israeli .
the documentary won several awards , but it could n't be shown in jenin , where it all happened .
the town 's only movie theater was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago .
ahmed 's parents asked vetter to help renovate and reopen it , because they wanted to create more opportunities for local children .
he agreed , although he 'd never funded or managed a building project before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcus vetter with one of the palestinian teens who 's been helping on the project " you ca n't open such a place just by helping .
it 's impossible as i realized very fast .
this is real work .
what i could have helped with was fundraising , but raising money is nothing - raising money just means corruption , " said vetter .
vetter has run things in an unorthodox way .
he did n't apply for funding before starting .
he just began , with no salaries at all to pay the german architects and engineers .
they 're volunteers .
" just take a step , that 's what we did here , just renovate , do n't talk all the time , and do it with all your passion , " said vetter .
the project is ambitious .
vetter and his team are renovating the old indoor cinema , building an outdoor one , adding a cafe and guest house , as well as setting up a film production and distribution company .
government , private donors covered costs so far , the project has cost more than half a million euros .
most of the money has come from the german government , with the rest from corporate donors and ordinary people .
along the way , money has always been tight .
earlier this year , vetter simply ran out of cash .
he wrote to six donors saying he needed 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- to finish the job .
only one of them replied - legendary british musician roger waters , of pink floyd fame .
" having met all the people involved i felt connected to them and i felt it was the least i could do to give them the money to finish the project , " said waters , talking by phone from the united states .
waters says he was inspired to help by the generosity of ahmed khatib 's father .
" this project was fundamentally and always attached to that story , that incredibly moving story .
he gives the rest of us hope that we may at some point find a partial solution to the plight the palestinian people find themselves in , " said waters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck delivers all the technical equipment to the cinema dialogue with other cultures fakhri hamad , the project manager for cinema jenin , says the project is changing the town .
" we started with a small idea to have a place for kids to play and learn but it 's had local and international support , and it 's grown and grown .
now it 's become a project of the town itself .
jenin has the chance to prove it 's ready to accept other cultures , to accept peace and to accept dialogue , " said hamad .
it 's been a huge turnaround for jenin , a town with a population of around 250,000 which became known as the source of a third of the suicide bombers of the palestinian uprising known as the second intifada .
now , young palestinians are learning about filmmaking side by side with german students , as well as working on the building site together .
opposition from intellectuals but there has been some palestinian opposition to the project .
earlier this year , palestinian intellectuals criticized cinema jenin , arguing that it " normalized " relations between palestinians and israel .
they said the project relied on cooperation with israel and that they opposed building a cinema while israel 's occupation army remained in the west bank .
vetter admits that he was discouraged .
" i did think then that the project might fail .
i thought that i ca n't keep giving my time to a project which has a fundamentalist approach .
it was very depressing , " said vetter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's still a long way to go on the building site but the faith of ordinary people in the project restored vetter 's commitment , as did the unswerving determination of ahmed khatib 's parents .
for them , cinema jenin is the fulfilment of a dream .
they want the town 's young people to have more of everything than their son had - more opportunities , more of a future , and of course more security .
when he died , ahmed saved the lives of the five children who received his organs .
with this movie theater , established in his memory , they hope he will touch the lives of countless more .
opening in time for world cup cinema jenin is now almost complete .
the members of the project team hope to open the outdoor cinema in time for the world cup later this month .
the official opening of the restored indoor cinema is scheduled for august .

the cinema was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago . marcus vetter made a film in jenin three years ago - and stayed on to build a cinema in which to show it .
his documentary film , " the heart of jenin , " is about ahmed khatib , a palestinian boy killed by israeli troops while playing with a toy gun in the town 's refugee camp .
his parents decided to donate their son 's organs to save the lives of other children - arab and israeli .
the documentary won several awards , but it could n't be shown in jenin , where it all happened .
the town 's only movie theater was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago .

" this has been a clear act of piracy , " he angrily told reporters .

german foreign minister guido westerwelle has criticised the israeli raid while german chancellor angela merkel has called for a lifting of the blockade of gaza . also on board were matthias jochheim , a german representative of international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war ; inge hoeger and annette groth , current left party members of parliament ; and nadel el sakka , a representative of the palestinian community in germany .

hoeger , one of the two members of parliament , said the women on the ship were quickly shut in a lower level of the ship , the so-called ' women 's deck , ' during the night .
" we could n't get out , we did n't know what was going on above because we were locked in , " she said .
" we put on our life vests and eventually we figured out that the ship was occupied , that the israelis had taken it over . "
hoeger and her colleague groth said they did not know who had shut them in - the organizers of the flotilla or the israelis .
after they were let out they were searched , handcuffed and brought to the port in the israeli city of ashdod .
there they were allowed to contact the german embassy , she said .
" this is against any kind of international law , just like the blockade of gaza is against international law , " she said .
" and through our actions we wanted to make it known that this is illegal . "

the accusations are in connection with the hiring of a priest alleged to have been a sex offender in the 1980s . german prosecutors announced on wednesday that they were investigating claims that the head of the german bishops ' conference , robert zollitsch , aided and abetted a known sex offender in the church .
prosecutors said that they had received information indicating that , while zollitsch was in charge of the personnel department of a diocese in southern germany in 1987 , he appointed a priest who was known to have abused children .
the archdiocese of freiburg has released a statement denying that zollitsch was responsible for the appointment .
aiding and abetting prosecutors confirmed that they had launched an investigation , following reports by public broadcaster ard and the suedkurier newspaper .
the freiburg archdiocese has described the media reports as " absolutely weak " and " sensationalist . "
in 1987 zollitsch was head of the human resources department of the diocese of freiburg .
he is accused of rehiring a priest accused of sexually abusing children in a monestary in the 1960s .
the diocese says that the appointment was entirely in the hands of the monastery 's abbot , and that zollitsch neither knew of the original allegations nor the subsequent re-appointment .
part of a wider scandal sexual abuse scandals have rocked the church in germany since january , when dozens of cases emerged involving allegations of the sexual molestation of minors by priests and other clergy over a period of 50 years at catholic schools .
as head of the bishops ' conference , zollitsch has been at the forefront of the catholic church 's response to the ongoing reports of abuse .
he has often stated that the church needs to reform and " heal the wounds of victims . "

the accusations are in connection with the hiring of a priest alleged to have been a sex offender in the 1980s . german prosecutors announced on wednesday that they were investigating claims that the head of the german bishops ' conference , robert zollitsch , aided and abetted a known sex offender in the church .
prosecutors said that they had received information indicating that , while zollitsch was in charge of the personnel department of a diocese in southern germany in 1987 , he appointed a priest who was known to have abused children .
the archdiocese of freiburg has released a statement denying that zollitsch was responsible for the appointment .
aiding and abetting prosecutors confirmed that they had launched an investigation , following reports by public broadcaster ard and the suedkurier newspaper .
the freiburg archdiocese has described the media reports as " absolutely weak " and " sensationalist . "
in 1987 zollitsch was head of the human resources department of the diocese of freiburg .
he is accused of rehiring a priest accused of sexually abusing children in a monestary in the 1960s .
the diocese says that the appointment was entirely in the hands of the monastery 's abbot , and that zollitsch neither knew of the original allegations nor the subsequent re-appointment .
part of a wider scandal sexual abuse scandals have rocked the church in germany since january , when dozens of cases emerged involving allegations of the sexual molestation of minors by priests and other clergy over a period of 50 years at catholic schools .
as head of the bishops ' conference , zollitsch has been at the forefront of the catholic church 's response to the ongoing reports of abuse .
he has often stated that the church needs to reform and " heal the wounds of victims . "
in his easter messages to his freiburg parishoners , he said the catholic church must examine its " dark aspects as well as our own shadowy sides .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 02.06.2010 irascible german literary critic reich-ranicki turns 90 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki had an idea early on of a new style of literary criticism marcel reich-ranicki is germany 's best known literary critic .
his long career and definitive pronouncements have earned him the irreverent nickname " the pope of german letters . "
on june 2 , he turns 90 . marcel reich-ranicki was in charge of the literature section of the national newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in the 1970s , and hosted the television book discussion program " literary quartet " throughout the 1990 's .
these and many other public appearances where he freely made his pronouncements on german books and writing have made him one of germany 's best-known cultural critics .
reich-ranicki , who is celebrating his 90th birthday on june 2 , is also one of just a handful of jewish public figures in germany to resettle in the country after having survived world war ii .
born in 1920 in wloclawek , poland , the future critic attended high school in berlin .
because he was jewish , he was denied entry to the university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the critic , just ending his ninth decade , is still up for an argument after being deported to poland , reich-ranicki was able to flee the warsaw ghetto with his wife , tosia .
in 1958 , he returned to germany and dedicated himself to the study of german language and literature - and saw an opening for himself in the world of german letters .
risky career move " when i came to germany in ' 58 , and i saw what people were writing about literature in the -lsb- newspapers here , -rsb- i told my wife : i want to do an experiment , " reich-ranicki said in an acceptance speech after receiving the north rhine-westphalia state prize in 2005 .
" these people write so confusingly , so cryptically , i just do n't like their criticism , " he continued .
" i will say loud and clear what i think about books .
it is risky , and two things could happen : i will either rise to the top of the literary criticism hierarchy , or sink to the very bottom .
but i have to try . "
reich-ranicki has remained incorruptible and sharp in his opinions , and he does n't mince words .
that attitude has cost him a few friends over the years .
his dedication to speaking the truth as he sees it was behind a major uproar in 2008 , when he was invited to receive an honorary german television prize for his cultural contributions .
as recipients awaiting awards usually do , he sat passively in the audience as one tv personality after another came up to make a speech , accept an award , or tell a few jokes .
critic who speaks his mind he was definitely not impressed with what he saw - and he made no secret of his feelings .
when the time came for him to accept his honorary award , he stunned viewers by rejecting it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel awarded reich-ranicki the henri-nannen prize in 2008 " i can not accept this prize , " reich-ranicki told the shocked audience .
" i did n't know what to expect here , and i think it is awful that i had to sit through this for so many hours . "
at first , some of the guests at the ceremony thought reich-ranicki was joking .
but in this case he was simply telling it like he saw it - live and on the air .
by giving an open , radical critique of what he saw as the poor state of german television , reich-ranicki underlined his reputation as something of a crank , not to mention a " hard taskmaster " and a " a specialist in executions , " as different critics have put it .
reich-ranicki answers his detractors by saying that indeed , his first and foremost job is to be tough and critical .
years on ' literary quartet ' " being called an ' execution specialist ' is really nonsense , " reich-ranicki told broadcaster wdr in a 1986 interview .
" but i try to be clear in my criticism .
and the clarity of criticism , well , that is a question of politesse .
you have to be polite to the readers .
and that means being clear and explicit with your meaning , not hiding behind ambiguous or enigmatic phrases . "
his appearances as the head critic on television 's " literary quartet " between 1988 and 2001 brought reich-ranicki to the small screen some 77 times - automatically launching him to the top of germany 's lit-crit pop cultural heap .
despite his fame , however , he certainly is n't infallible .
and if he had a reputation for judging literature based more on his personal reading preferences than on serious criticism , well , that did n't stop his opinion from making and breaking many a literary career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his 2008 rejection of the german tv prize came as a shock those who raised his wrath - peter handke , guenter grass or martin walser , for example - had to fight their way into the market .
on the contrary , favorites such as spanish writer javier marias or berlin chronicler judith hermann more or less owe their success to reich-ranicki 's praises .
boring book ?
bad news the worst thing that reich-ranicki could say about a book was : " boring . "
his anti-academic , folksy and agreeably polemical ideas about literature can most likely be traced back to his own , sad biography .
as a persecuted jew he escaped the warsaw ghetto and various deportations , as though by a miracle .
at the time , a polish printer hid reich-ranicki and his wife from the nazis .
in payment , the literature lover regaled his benefactors with an endless slew of stories : shakespeare , goethe , schiller , etc .
telling stories to stay alive - the experience made a lasting impression on reich-ranicki , whose biggest successes came when he broke literary-criticism taboos .
years later , he wrote his own life story , and - unlike the biographies of many other critics - this one became a bestseller .

his long career and definitive pronouncements have earned him the irreverent nickname " the pope of german letters . "
on june 2 , he turns 90 . marcel reich-ranicki was in charge of the literature section of the national newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in the 1970s , and hosted the television book discussion program " literary quartet " throughout the 1990 's .
these and many other public appearances where he freely made his pronouncements on german books and writing have made him one of germany 's best-known cultural critics .
reich-ranicki , who is celebrating his 90th birthday on june 2 , is also one of just a handful of jewish public figures in germany to resettle in the country after having survived world war ii .
born in 1920 in wloclawek , poland , the future critic attended high school in berlin .
because he was jewish , he was denied entry to the university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the critic , just ending his ninth decade , is still up for an argument after being deported to poland , reich-ranicki was able to flee the warsaw ghetto with his wife , tosia .
in 1958 , he returned to germany and dedicated himself to the study of german language and literature - and saw an opening for himself in the world of german letters .
risky career move " when i came to germany in ' 58 , and i saw what people were writing about literature in the -lsb- newspapers here , -rsb- i told my wife : i want to do an experiment , " reich-ranicki said in an acceptance speech after receiving the north rhine-westphalia state prize in 2005 .
" these people write so confusingly , so cryptically , i just do n't like their criticism , " he continued .
" i will say loud and clear what i think about books .
it is risky , and two things could happen : i will either rise to the top of the literary criticism hierarchy , or sink to the very bottom .
but i have to try . "
reich-ranicki has remained incorruptible and sharp in his opinions , and he does n't mince words .
that attitude has cost him a few friends over the years .
his dedication to speaking the truth as he sees it was behind a major uproar in 2008 , when he was invited to receive an honorary german television prize for his cultural contributions .
as recipients awaiting awards usually do , he sat passively in the audience as one tv personality after another came up to make a speech , accept an award , or tell a few jokes .
critic who speaks his mind he was definitely not impressed with what he saw - and he made no secret of his feelings .
when the time came for him to accept his honorary award , he stunned viewers by rejecting it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel awarded reich-ranicki the henri-nannen prize in 2008 " i can not accept this prize , " reich-ranicki told the shocked audience .
" i did n't know what to expect here , and i think it is awful that i had to sit through this for so many hours . "
at first , some of the guests at the ceremony thought reich-ranicki was joking .
but in this case he was simply telling it like he saw it - live and on the air .
by giving an open , radical critique of what he saw as the poor state of german television , reich-ranicki underlined his reputation as something of a crank , not to mention a " hard taskmaster " and a " a specialist in executions , " as different critics have put it .
reich-ranicki answers his detractors by saying that indeed , his first and foremost job is to be tough and critical .
years on ' literary quartet ' " being called an ' execution specialist ' is really nonsense , " reich-ranicki told broadcaster wdr in a 1986 interview .
" but i try to be clear in my criticism .
and the clarity of criticism , well , that is a question of politesse .
you have to be polite to the readers .
and that means being clear and explicit with your meaning , not hiding behind ambiguous or enigmatic phrases . "
his appearances as the head critic on television 's " literary quartet " between 1988 and 2001 brought reich-ranicki to the small screen some 77 times - automatically launching him to the top of germany 's lit-crit pop cultural heap .
despite his fame , however , he certainly is n't infallible .
and if he had a reputation for judging literature based more on his personal reading preferences than on serious criticism , well , that did n't stop his opinion from making and breaking many a literary career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his 2008 rejection of the german tv prize came as a shock those who raised his wrath - peter handke , guenter grass or martin walser , for example - had to fight their way into the market .
on the contrary , favorites such as spanish writer javier marias or berlin chronicler judith hermann more or less owe their success to reich-ranicki 's praises .
boring book ?
bad news the worst thing that reich-ranicki could say about a book was : " boring . "
his anti-academic , folksy and agreeably polemical ideas about literature can most likely be traced back to his own , sad biography .
as a persecuted jew he escaped the warsaw ghetto and various deportations , as though by a miracle .
at the time , a polish printer hid reich-ranicki and his wife from the nazis .
in payment , the literature lover regaled his benefactors with an endless slew of stories : shakespeare , goethe , schiller , etc .
telling stories to stay alive - the experience made a lasting impression on reich-ranicki , whose biggest successes came when he broke literary-criticism taboos .
years later , he wrote his own life story , and - unlike the biographies of many other critics - this one became a bestseller .

his long career and definitive pronouncements have earned him the irreverent nickname " the pope of german letters . "
on june 2 , he turns 90 . marcel reich-ranicki was in charge of the literature section of the national newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in the 1970s , and hosted the television book discussion program " literary quartet " throughout the 1990 's .
these and many other public appearances where he freely made his pronouncements on german books and writing have made him one of germany 's best-known cultural critics .
reich-ranicki , who is celebrating his 90th birthday on june 2 , is also one of just a handful of jewish public figures in germany to resettle in the country after having survived world war ii .
born in 1920 in wloclawek , poland , the future critic attended high school in berlin .
because he was jewish , he was denied entry to the university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the critic , just ending his ninth decade , is still up for an argument after being deported to poland , reich-ranicki was able to flee the warsaw ghetto with his wife , tosia .
in 1958 , he returned to germany and dedicated himself to the study of german language and literature - and saw an opening for himself in the world of german letters .
risky career move " when i came to germany in ' 58 , and i saw what people were writing about literature in the -lsb- newspapers here , -rsb- i told my wife : i want to do an experiment , " reich-ranicki said in an acceptance speech after receiving the north rhine-westphalia state prize in 2005 .
" these people write so confusingly , so cryptically , i just do n't like their criticism , " he continued .
" i will say loud and clear what i think about books .
it is risky , and two things could happen : i will either rise to the top of the literary criticism hierarchy , or sink to the very bottom .
but i have to try . "
reich-ranicki has remained incorruptible and sharp in his opinions , and he does n't mince words .
that attitude has cost him a few friends over the years .
his dedication to speaking the truth as he sees it was behind a major uproar in 2008 , when he was invited to receive an honorary german television prize for his cultural contributions .
as recipients awaiting awards usually do , he sat passively in the audience as one tv personality after another came up to make a speech , accept an award , or tell a few jokes .
critic who speaks his mind he was definitely not impressed with what he saw - and he made no secret of his feelings .
when the time came for him to accept his honorary award , he stunned viewers by rejecting it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel awarded reich-ranicki the henri-nannen prize in 2008 " i can not accept this prize , " reich-ranicki told the shocked audience .
" i did n't know what to expect here , and i think it is awful that i had to sit through this for so many hours . "
at first , some of the guests at the ceremony thought reich-ranicki was joking .
but in this case he was simply telling it like he saw it - live and on the air .
by giving an open , radical critique of what he saw as the poor state of german television , reich-ranicki underlined his reputation as something of a crank , not to mention a " hard taskmaster " and a " a specialist in executions , " as different critics have put it .
reich-ranicki answers his detractors by saying that indeed , his first and foremost job is to be tough and critical .
years on ' literary quartet ' " being called an ' execution specialist ' is really nonsense , " reich-ranicki told broadcaster wdr in a 1986 interview .
" but i try to be clear in my criticism .
and the clarity of criticism , well , that is a question of politesse .
you have to be polite to the readers .
and that means being clear and explicit with your meaning , not hiding behind ambiguous or enigmatic phrases . "
his appearances as the head critic on television 's " literary quartet " between 1988 and 2001 brought reich-ranicki to the small screen some 77 times - automatically launching him to the top of germany 's lit-crit pop cultural heap .
despite his fame , however , he certainly is n't infallible .
and if he had a reputation for judging literature based more on his personal reading preferences than on serious criticism , well , that did n't stop his opinion from making and breaking many a literary career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his 2008 rejection of the german tv prize came as a shock those who raised his wrath - peter handke , guenter grass or martin walser , for example - had to fight their way into the market .
on the contrary , favorites such as spanish writer javier marias or berlin chronicler judith hermann more or less owe their success to reich-ranicki 's praises .
boring book ?
bad news the worst thing that reich-ranicki could say about a book was : " boring . "
his anti-academic , folksy and agreeably polemical ideas about literature can most likely be traced back to his own , sad biography .
as a persecuted jew he escaped the warsaw ghetto and various deportations , as though by a miracle .
at the time , a polish printer hid reich-ranicki and his wife from the nazis .
in payment , the literature lover regaled his benefactors with an endless slew of stories : shakespeare , goethe , schiller , etc .
telling stories to stay alive - the experience made a lasting impression on reich-ranicki , whose biggest successes came when he broke literary-criticism taboos .
years later , he wrote his own life story , and - unlike the biographies of many other critics - this one became a bestseller .

when asked whether she would be interested in the job , von der leyen avoided any concrete statements of intent but there 's little doubt she has the confidence to take over from horst koehler .
" we now need to find a good solution for the country under extreme time pressure , " she said .
" i think it 's very important that the president enjoys a high level of trust from the people . "
von der leyen started her political career rather late but quickly rose through the party ranks .
it was not until 1990 that she joined the conservative christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
she first studied economics and later medicine before going on to work as a doctor and in research .

in 2009 , von der leyen became germany 's new labor minister after franz josef jung resigned .
her new post has seen her popularity undiminished as the german labor market seemed to withstand the expected downturn in the wake of the global economic crisis .

when asked whether she would be interested in the job , von der leyen avoided any concrete statements of intent but there 's little doubt she has the confidence to take over from horst koehler .
" we now need to find a good solution for the country under extreme time pressure , " she said .
" i think it 's very important that the president enjoys a high level of trust from the people . "
von der leyen started her political career rather late but quickly rose through the party ranks .
it was not until 1990 that she joined the conservative christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
she first studied economics and later medicine before going on to work as a doctor and in research .
she entered local politics in 1991 and less than two years later was elected into the state parliament of lower saxony , where became minister for social affairs .

she successfully fought for a modern , social familiy policy to give , for example , single mothers better career chances .
in 2009 , von der leyen became germany 's new labor minister after franz josef jung resigned .
her new post has seen her popularity undiminished as the german labor market seemed to withstand the expected downturn in the wake of the global economic crisis .
initial opinion polls suggest that von der leyen is the politician who can muster more popular support than any of the other possible successors to koehler .
40 percent of the population are in favor of a woman taking over the country 's most senior post , while 25 percent would like to see von der leyen herself take over .
the post of president is largely ceremonial in germany , and the incumbent usually abstains from commenting on party politics .
the president is however expected to act as a moral authority in wider national debates .
popular and political backing born in 1958 , von der leyen hails from a family with a longstanding tradition in politics .
her father was former state premier of lower saxony ernst albrecht , who also worked in brussels for the eu 's predecessor , the european community .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 02.06.2010 european commission plans reform of rating agency regulation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies are blamed for worsening the financial crisis credit rating agencies in the european union could soon be subject to new operating regulations , but some analysts fear that too much regulation will stifle competition in an sector already under a virtual oligopoly . the european commission on wednesday unveiled new proposals for regulating credit rating agencies -lrb- cras -rrb- , which some analysts blame for exacerbating the turmoil in european financial markets .
the new guidelines provide stricter transparency guidelines , and place cra regulation under the authority of the european securities and markets authority -lrb- esma -rrb- , which the commission established last year and is due to come into force at the start of 2011 .
the esma would have the authority to impose sanctions on agencies , and even withdraw their licenses when they fail to comply with regulations .
the three main credit rating agencies , standard & poor 's , moody 's and fitch , had operated with significant latitude before the eu began issuing licenses and demanding a certain level of transparency just last year , according to karel lannoo , director of the european credit research institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lowered bond ratings have made it hard for greece to finance its budget " when the financial crisis started in 2007 , it was very clear that the ratings which the rating agencies gave were not based on pure objective facts , " he told deutsche welle .
" there were huge conflicts of interest .
that 's why the eu was then convinced that there should be a piece of regulation . "
case for regulation one function of rating agencies is to rate the risk of government bonds , using a scale of aaa for the most secure to d for an almost certain default .
the agencies then sell these ratings to investors and banks .
the conflict of interest appears when the agencies rate the very institutions that buy their services , said robert halver , stock analyst for baader bank .
" the rating agencies finance themselves very strongly with the sale of analytical instruments on pension funds , insurance agencies and banks , because everyone assumes that they have a lot of knowledge about country 's risks , " he told deutsche welle .
another reason for further regulation is the role cras have played in crises related to the public finance of budgets , most notably in greece but also in spain , portugal and italy , said lannoo .
when ratings agencies devalue government bonds , it creates a problem of " systemic stability . "
" all of a sudden these ratings agencies have drastically downgraded the debt of these countries , which as given rise to systemic effects , in the sense that many investors have started to sell the securities or the bonds of these countries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker has proposed a new cra close to the european central bank more competition halver said one solution to europe 's problem with cras would be the creation of a european rating agency to compete with the " big three , " as long as it was n't under the supervision of a public entity like the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- or the european commission , as eurogroup president jean-claude juncker recently suggested .
" then there would be suspicion that they would exercise their influence and try to sugarcoat negative evaluations , " he said .
" that can not happen . "
lannoo said the big three already have a european component in fitch , whose main shareholder is european .
rather than constructing a new european rating agency , he said regulators should instead make it easier for already-existing agencies to be licensed as cras .
" what in fact we need to do is ... to lower the entry barriers into the sector , " he said .
" but what we in fact have done with this european regulation now is just the opposite - we have increased the entry thresholds because it 's extremely difficult to be in line with this piece of regulation . "

the new guidelines provide stricter transparency guidelines , and place cra regulation under the authority of the european securities and markets authority -lrb- esma -rrb- , which the commission established last year and is due to come into force at the start of 2011 .
the esma would have the authority to impose sanctions on agencies , and even withdraw their licenses when they fail to comply with regulations .
the three main credit rating agencies , standard & poor 's , moody 's and fitch , had operated with significant latitude before the eu began issuing licenses and demanding a certain level of transparency just last year , according to karel lannoo , director of the european credit research institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lowered bond ratings have made it hard for greece to finance its budget " when the financial crisis started in 2007 , it was very clear that the ratings which the rating agencies gave were not based on pure objective facts , " he told deutsche welle .
" there were huge conflicts of interest .
that 's why the eu was then convinced that there should be a piece of regulation . "
case for regulation one function of rating agencies is to rate the risk of government bonds , using a scale of aaa for the most secure to d for an almost certain default .
the agencies then sell these ratings to investors and banks .
the conflict of interest appears when the agencies rate the very institutions that buy their services , said robert halver , stock analyst for baader bank .
" the rating agencies finance themselves very strongly with the sale of analytical instruments on pension funds , insurance agencies and banks , because everyone assumes that they have a lot of knowledge about country 's risks , " he told deutsche welle .
another reason for further regulation is the role cras have played in crises related to the public finance of budgets , most notably in greece but also in spain , portugal and italy , said lannoo .
when ratings agencies devalue government bonds , it creates a problem of " systemic stability . "
" all of a sudden these ratings agencies have drastically downgraded the debt of these countries , which as given rise to systemic effects , in the sense that many investors have started to sell the securities or the bonds of these countries , " he said .

some analysts are saying the next days will be crucial for its future . in an editorial , the website of german public broadcaster zdf said " the fate of this -lsb- government -rsb- coalition will be decided in the next ten days . "
that 's a drastic view , but there 's no doubt that the resignation of the german president , horst koehler , on monday has delivered a major blow to the government .
it has many important issues to be dealing with : the crisis in the eurozone , the need for drastic savings , or the military involvement in afghanistan , to mention just a few .
and the government coalition , made up of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , has a few crises of its own : the poor showing of the two parties in the indecisive regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the sudden resignation of powerful regional leader roland koch in hessen , the internal backbiting within the liberal party , and disastrous opinion poll ratings .
so the chancellor , angela merkel , could well do without the scramble to find a convincing new president within 30 days , as required by the constitution .
is it a crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she regretted koehler 's departure and had tried to change his mind in a major interview on the evening of koehler 's resignation , she insisted , " we have to be sure not to make a crisis out of every challenge . "
but peter stuetzle , head of deutsche welle 's berlin office , thinks that a crisis is exactly what this is .
" this has been one too much for the government , " he says .
" there 's been a lot of trouble , and the government was just about to try to leave all that behind , and in this minute , koehler resigns . "
if the current government were doing well , the resignation would just be a nuisance , but it 's a sign of the government 's problems that the nuisance was immediately seen as a crisis .
all at sea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's coalition partners have already said they 'll leave the choice up to her wolfgang bosbach , a senior cdu backbencher , says that people do n't trust politicians of any party to solve the country 's problems , and so when respected figures like koehler or koch resign , the people feel that " the good people have left the ship , and we do n't how we will carry on in this rough sea . " what he , as a government supporter , fails to mention , is that , even if the people are disillusioned with all politicians , it 's his coalition which has the power to pilot the ship , and so that 's where the criticism hits particularly hard .
merkel has often been criticized for her lack of leadership - she tends to sit things out and wait until a consensus emerges - but the choice of a new president will require decisive action . peter stuetzle thinks the whole coalition has recognized the need .
her partners - not just the liberals , but also her bavarian sister-party , the csu - have agreed that they will do without their own candidates , and let her make the choice . " everything will be very fast , " he thinks , " and if it 's fast , and if it 's convincing too , then the government might even come out of the whole thing with a better public image at the end of the day .

some analysts are saying the next days will be crucial for its future . in an editorial , the website of german public broadcaster zdf said " the fate of this -lsb- government -rsb- coalition will be decided in the next ten days . "
that 's a drastic view , but there 's no doubt that the resignation of the german president , horst koehler , on monday has delivered a major blow to the government .
it has many important issues to be dealing with : the crisis in the eurozone , the need for drastic savings , or the military involvement in afghanistan , to mention just a few .
and the government coalition , made up of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , has a few crises of its own : the poor showing of the two parties in the indecisive regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the sudden resignation of powerful regional leader roland koch in hessen , the internal backbiting within the liberal party , and disastrous opinion poll ratings .
so the chancellor , angela merkel , could well do without the scramble to find a convincing new president within 30 days , as required by the constitution .
is it a crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she regretted koehler 's departure and had tried to change his mind in a major interview on the evening of koehler 's resignation , she insisted , " we have to be sure not to make a crisis out of every challenge . "
but peter stuetzle , head of deutsche welle 's berlin office , thinks that a crisis is exactly what this is .
" this has been one too much for the government , " he says .
" there 's been a lot of trouble , and the government was just about to try to leave all that behind , and in this minute , koehler resigns . "
if the current government were doing well , the resignation would just be a nuisance , but it 's a sign of the government 's problems that the nuisance was immediately seen as a crisis .

swedish foreign minister carl bildt was among the european leaders in sarajevo lending his support to some balkan nations bidding to join the eu .
" there are a number of countries where enthusiasm for enlargement is less than 100 percent these days .
then it is important that we come here to reaffirm and say ... the door is open , " bildt said .

however , many balkan states will be hoping more than rhetoric comes out of the meeting .
this could come in the form of extending the right to travel without visas in the eu 's schengen zone to bosnia and albania , an idea put forth in brussels last week .
this right has already been given to serbia , montenegro and macedonia .

turkey has attempted to play mediator in middle east , but that was before an israeli military attack on a turkish aid ship .
ankara is playing with fire , says baha guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . the whole world knows that israel is not squeamish about enforcing its interests .
and in light of the latest attacks on gaza , it is a fact that israel will not hesitate violating human rights under the pretext of self-defense and attacking people with brute military force without regard for civilian casualties .
the question must be asked : what was the purpose of the actions of this independent turkish aid organization ?
the officially stated goals were not achieved ; the flotilla could neither break the israeli naval blockade nor bring relief supplies directly to gaza .
for weeks , israel had communicated to turkey through all available diplomatic channels that such aid action would , if necessary , be stopped with violence .
israel made good on its threats and boarded the largest ship of the maritime aid convoy , contravening international maritime law .
in the process there was a shoot-out : at least nine people died and dozens more were injured .
and now , the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan rages unchecked against israel and is playing a dangerous game .
turkey has been a nato member for almost 60 years .
as an ally in the western defense alliance , turkey has a peace obligation .
recent turkish diplomacy has succeeded in smoothing the tensions between iran and the west and mediating between syria and israel while remaining credible in the process .
but with this week 's incident , turkey has reduced itself to just another member of the anti-israel front in the middle east .
at the very least , turkey 's credibility regarding future mediation is put in doubt .
the turkish ship was decorated with giant turkish and palestinian flags .
the image of the incident was that israeli soldiers captured a turkish ship .
in turkey , tens of thousands of demonstrators were mobilized and laid siege to israel 's diplomatic missions .
prime minister erdogan raged on against israel , speaking of " state terrorism , " a " regime of lies " and arguing that israel must now be " punished . "
according to erdogan , whoever chooses to ignore the atrocities of israel makes himself " complicit in the crime against humanity . "
the arduous international efforts to achieve a lasting peace in the middle east are important to turkey , as is the peace process in the caucasus or the balkans .
therefore , they should not be harnessed to the cart of discordant states in the middle east that lack basic democratic structures . there are very few , barely audible voices in turkey that warn against a further verbal escalation .
in europe , the erdogan 's arguments fall on stunned ears .
although he condemns anti-semitism and promises the jewish community in his country security , the waves of anti-israeli hatred have reached turkey .
one of the few sensible voices in europe came from ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign committee of the german bundestag .
he called , contrary to the stance of germany 's christian democrats , for attempts to further motivate turkey towards eu membership rather than to reject it on religious and cultural grounds . it 's easy to see which camp turkey will fall into if its bid for eu membership fails . the eu would be acting in their own foreign policy interests by keeping turkey on the membership track .

turkey has attempted to play mediator in middle east , but that was before an israeli military attack on a turkish aid ship .
ankara is playing with fire , says baha guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . the whole world knows that israel is not squeamish about enforcing its interests .
and in light of the latest attacks on gaza , it is a fact that israel will not hesitate violating human rights under the pretext of self-defense and attacking people with brute military force without regard for civilian casualties .
the question must be asked : what was the purpose of the actions of this independent turkish aid organization ?
the officially stated goals were not achieved ; the flotilla could neither break the israeli naval blockade nor bring relief supplies directly to gaza .
for weeks , israel had communicated to turkey through all available diplomatic channels that such aid action would , if necessary , be stopped with violence .
israel made good on its threats and boarded the largest ship of the maritime aid convoy , contravening international maritime law .
in the process there was a shoot-out : at least nine people died and dozens more were injured .
and now , the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan rages unchecked against israel and is playing a dangerous game .
turkey has been a nato member for almost 60 years .
as an ally in the western defense alliance , turkey has a peace obligation .
recent turkish diplomacy has succeeded in smoothing the tensions between iran and the west and mediating between syria and israel while remaining credible in the process .
but with this week 's incident , turkey has reduced itself to just another member of the anti-israel front in the middle east .
at the very least , turkey 's credibility regarding future mediation is put in doubt .
the turkish ship was decorated with giant turkish and palestinian flags .
the image of the incident was that israeli soldiers captured a turkish ship .
in turkey , tens of thousands of demonstrators were mobilized and laid siege to israel 's diplomatic missions .
prime minister erdogan raged on against israel , speaking of " state terrorism , " a " regime of lies " and arguing that israel must now be " punished . "

and if anyone thought that , this time , the financial crisis would have dampened the world 's enthusiasm for bringing death and destruction upon their neighbours , they 'll be disappointed .
military expenditure went up substantially . a sipri report released on wednesday estimates expenditure in 2009 amounted globally to 1.5 trillion dollars , 5.9 percent more than in the previous year .
in fact the crisis may have been one of the reasons for the increase .
dr sam perlo-freeman , head of the military expenditure project at sipri , says that many countries increased public spending generally in 2009 as a way of boosting demand to combat the recession : " although military spending has n't been a big part of economic stimulus packages , public spending has n't been cut yet , " he said .
usa leads again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sipri welcomes us efforts at nuclear disarmament once more , it 's the united states which is at the top of the list , with 53 percent of the world 's expenditure - an increase of 47 billion dollars .
perlo-freeman sees little likelihood of any change in the us strategy of absolute dominance , even under president barack obama .
it 's insurance " against any possible eventuality , " he said .
but the us was not alone : almost every region of the world , apart from some small countries in eastern europe , has increased military expenditure .
countries with significant natural resources have been particularly energetic .
algeria and nigeria have doubled their expenditure , kazakhstan has increased spending by 360 percent , azerbaijan by nearly 500 percent , the democratic republic of congo by as much 663 percent .
nuclear progress every year sipri asks governments directly for their defence spending figures . but they also study national budgets , and call on outside experts to help them , since defence expenditure is often fairly secretive and many projects run over several years .
sipri does see some progress towards a serious reduction in the 8,000 nuclear warheads in the world , thanks to obama 's efforts to reach a wide-ranging disarmament and non-proliferation treaty .
but even there , the increasing isolation of north korea and iran 's questionable nuclear program give grounds for pessimism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this german submarine is on its way to greece german arms trade germany has the world 's seventh largest expenditure on arms , at $ 46 billion -lrb- which is less than the us increase -rrb- .
even within europe , it 's not as big a spender as france or britain .
but what germany and most western european countries have in common is an overall drop in military spending , according to sam perlo-freeman .
" german military spending has been falling gradually , " he said .
" so germany like many countries in western europe does not perceive any clear conventional threat .
and i think most western european countries do not see the threats that do exist , whether it 's climate change or terrorism , as being susceptible to military solutions . "
the world 's gross domestic product fell by 0.9 percent in 2009 , but arms expenditure still went up .
a number of countries , including greece , have said they 're going to cut their expenditure this year or next . it seems they ca n't ignore the financial reality any longer .

however , his surprise resignation may jeopardize the success of his african projects . as the german president , horst koehler travelled the world .
on state visits , people saw a president that was interested in different cultures and societies .
but koehler was always fond of one continent in particular : africa .
he did not overlook africa 's ills and when he described them , he did not mince his words either .
but with koehler having left office , there is a looming danger that africa will fall back to the bottom of the political agenda in germany again .
new german presidents usually do not continue projects started by their predecessors , because they want to set their own political focus .
in this case , it likely wo n't include africa .
that is a shame , say experts , because when it came to corruption , civil war or lack of political leadership , the former president said what he thought – even if he was addressing african heads of state at the african union 's assembly .
at the same time , he did not ignore the many positive signs on the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler dances with ghanian president john agyekum kufuor in 2007 " civil society is growing across africa .
more and more people refuse to give in to their destinies .
farmers come together to buy fertilizer or to build wells .
civil society groups fight against corruption and put their governments to task .
women take the initiative to built schools or clinics for aids patients , ” koehler once said in a speech .
whether it was praise or criticism – horst koehler 's main priority was to establish a dialogue of equals between africans and germans .
in his first speech to parliament in july 2004 , koehler made it clear that africa was a priority for him .
" it is my conviction that the humanity of our world will be measured against the fate of africa , " koehler told members of germany 's lower house , the bundestag .
imf legacy troublesome at first but most african leaders did not start cheering at his words right away .
" there were many people in africa in the beginning that automatically identified horst koehler with the international monetary fund , " said ulf engel , a scholar in the africa department of the university of leipzig .
koehler had been at the helm of the international monetary fund until he was elected president .
the fund is notorious in africa for koehler 's structural adjustment policies , cost-cutting measures aimed at reducing public debts .
the imf forced various african countries to introduce school fees or make visits to the hospital more expensive as part of structural adjustment .
but koehler soon managed to change his perception in africa through his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited a youth center in rwanda in 2008 “ he gained a lot of popularity in africa when he started his ' partnership with africa ' initiative , " said engel .
partnership with africa was koehler 's pet project .
it was his attempt to make a direct contribution to the establishment of a dialogue of equals in real life .
it was n't just members of germany 's and africa 's political and business elite who discussed topics such as the difficult relationship between africa and europe or the challenges faced by africa 's youth .
promising young people known as " future leaders " from africa and germany also always sat at the table .
all words , no action ?
critics sometimes commented that the meetings were just another talking shop .
they liked to complain that africa did not need more words , but action .
but as the university of leipzig 's engel says , koehler was able to consistently make a clear statement about the policies regarding africa .
" some politicians were clearly uncomfortable when he took a firm stand on issues that he felt the west needed to change .
a reduction of subsidies for western products for instance , or the need to take africa seriously , " engel said .
germany 's constitution did not give koehler much room to put his political ideas into practice .
according to the law , the president has little political power .
instead , he had to use the power of words to influence german politics , and that power was n't always enough .
“ it 's tragic that he did not manage to make politicians in berlin listen to him , " said engel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 02.06.2010 bestselling indian novelist says operation green hunt has gone awry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian author arundhati roy is often present at protests the acclaimed indian writer and activist arundhati roy who is a staunch critic of the ongoing armed offensive against the maoist rebels in india argues that the government 's strategy has gone terribly wrong . the booker prize winner arundhati roy , who wrote the 1997 bestseller " the god of small things " , is also known internationally for her campaigns against the violence of states and private corporations .
she denounces the government 's anti-maoist offensive , which has been codenamed operation green hunt . " it has gone terribly wrong , " she told deutsche welle .
" to try and sort out this very deep problem militarily is to create a situation , which is quickly spiraling out of anybody 's ability to extract any kind of morality out of the various atrocities that are taking place .
unless they try to negotiate some kind of ceasefire , somehow , i do n't see how it is going to be sorted out .
i do n't even know whether talks can sort it out but certainly they have to try another tack . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 50,000 paramilitary troops are involved in operation green hunt the offensive to quell the maoist rebellion in the rural heartland involves 56,000 paramilitary troops in six states . offensive linked to economic interests roy claims the offensive is closely linked with economic interests .
" in states like orissa and jharkand , the security forces are moving against everybody resisting the takeover of their land by mining corporations , " she said . " millions of people are displaced from their lands by a government which is taking over resources .
i hate that word but they are taking over mountains , forests and land to hand them over to corporations .
hundreds and hundreds of mous have been signed .
environmental engineering and social engineering is taking place in the country .
anybody who thwarts that plan , whether maoists , gandhians or gandhian socialists or whoever they are , the minute somebody raises their voice or if somebody is effective , security moves against them .
they do n't mind dissent as long as they know it is entirely ineffective . " after meeting maoist guerrillas in their forest base earlier this year , roy penned a 20,000 word essay , arguing that the maoists had a point when they say the gap between the rich and the poor has increased .
the levers of government , she maintained , are increasingly controlled by private entities . " india today is a country where a lot of the growth rate is fuelled by this mining money , " she reiterated to deutsche welle .
" this situation is not new .
latin america has seen it , africa has seen it .
the kind of money you are talking about is so great that you can buy governments , buy the media , buy the courts , you can buy the whole country .
you can run the country and these people are gradually running the country .
the elections are not between the bjp , congress or the samajwadi party .
they are between the ambanis , the tatas , the mittals – the people pulling the strings now . " " two-pronged strategy is moronic " this situation is what makes the current offensive against the maoists even more absurd , she argues .
" this two-pronged strategy is moronic because the government 's idea of development is what caused the problem in the first place , " she said . " how are you going to solve it by what 's creating the problem as well as a military assault ?
operation green hunt is being built up as a war – they do n't want to use the word war but as an offensive let 's say – against the communist party of india -lrb- maoist -rrb- , which is a banned party . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last week , over 140 people were killed when a mumbai-bound train derailed .
the accident was blamed on the maoists .
the debate around the maoists in indian society is polarized – some support military action , others such as roy and certain rights activists say the rebels are a symptom of social inequity and decry the military offensive . the discussion is not likely to subside and has become more heated of late , as maoist attacks have become more deadly , increasingly targeting security personnel and even civilians . author : murali krishnan -lrb- new delhi -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although polish and russian investigators have not made any final conclusions , transcripts of the black-box cockpit recorders seem to support the theory that pilot error and poor conditions led to the crash .
the plane carrying kacynski and 95 other people , among them high-ranking government officials , crashed as it came in for a landing at smolensk airport in russia .
despite warnings from russian air traffic controllers - which can be heard on the black-box recordings - the pilots decided to attempt a landing anyway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's funeral followed a week after the crash " thank you , " said the chief pilot , arkadiusz protasiuk , on the recording , referring to the air traffic controller 's weather warning .
" if it 's possible , we 'll make an attempt , but if the weather is n't good we 'll go for a second pass . "
the pilots then began normal landing procedures .
about two minutes before the crash , alarms indicating " terrain ahead " with warnings to " pull up " repeatedly sounded in the cockpit .
these warnings went unheeded by the pilots until it was too late .
no indication of pressure from passengers in the polish media it had been speculated that pressure on the pilots to land , possibly from kaczynski himself , had contributed to the tragedy .
kaczynski and his delegation were running late for a planned ceremony in the katyn forest that marked the murder of 22,000 poles 70 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski and his wife both died in the crash however , the cockpit recordings provided no evidence to support this theory .
the voice of mariusz kazana , head of poland 's diplomatic protocol , can be heard telling the pilots " well , then we have a problem " if the plane were unable to land on the first try .
kazana can also be heard saying that there had been " no decision from the president on what to do . "
the pilots seemed to think that their landing attempt would not be possible due to the weather and that they would have to pull up for another pass or land at a different airport .
the last bit of audio recorded on the black box is the sound of the plane hitting a tree and an unidentified person in the cockpit cursing in polish .
the plane then flipped and crashed , killing everyone on board. mz / reuters / afp / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cinema was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago . marcus vetter made a film in jenin three years ago - and stayed on to build a cinema in which to show it .
his documentary film , " the heart of jenin , " is about ahmed khatib , a palestinian boy killed by israeli troops while playing with a toy gun in the town 's refugee camp .
his parents decided to donate their son 's organs to save the lives of other children - arab and israeli .
the documentary won several awards , but it could n't be shown in jenin , where it all happened .
the town 's only movie theater was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago .
ahmed 's parents asked vetter to help renovate and reopen it , because they wanted to create more opportunities for local children .
he agreed , although he 'd never funded or managed a building project before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcus vetter with one of the palestinian teens who 's been helping on the project " you ca n't open such a place just by helping .
it 's impossible as i realized very fast .
this is real work .
what i could have helped with was fundraising , but raising money is nothing - raising money just means corruption , " said vetter .
vetter has run things in an unorthodox way .
he did n't apply for funding before starting .
he just began , with no salaries at all to pay the german architects and engineers .
they 're volunteers .
" just take a step , that 's what we did here , just renovate , do n't talk all the time , and do it with all your passion , " said vetter .
the project is ambitious .
vetter and his team are renovating the old indoor cinema , building an outdoor one , adding a cafe and guest house , as well as setting up a film production and distribution company .
government , private donors covered costs so far , the project has cost more than half a million euros .
most of the money has come from the german government , with the rest from corporate donors and ordinary people .
along the way , money has always been tight .
earlier this year , vetter simply ran out of cash .
he wrote to six donors saying he needed 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- to finish the job .
only one of them replied - legendary british musician roger waters , of pink floyd fame .
" having met all the people involved i felt connected to them and i felt it was the least i could do to give them the money to finish the project , " said waters , talking by phone from the united states .
waters says he was inspired to help by the generosity of ahmed khatib 's father .
" this project was fundamentally and always attached to that story , that incredibly moving story .
he gives the rest of us hope that we may at some point find a partial solution to the plight the palestinian people find themselves in , " said waters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck delivers all the technical equipment to the cinema dialogue with other cultures fakhri hamad , the project manager for cinema jenin , says the project is changing the town .
" we started with a small idea to have a place for kids to play and learn but it 's had local and international support , and it 's grown and grown .
now it 's become a project of the town itself .
jenin has the chance to prove it 's ready to accept other cultures , to accept peace and to accept dialogue , " said hamad .
it 's been a huge turnaround for jenin , a town with a population of around 250,000 which became known as the source of a third of the suicide bombers of the palestinian uprising known as the second intifada .
now , young palestinians are learning about filmmaking side by side with german students , as well as working on the building site together .
opposition from intellectuals but there has been some palestinian opposition to the project .
earlier this year , palestinian intellectuals criticized cinema jenin , arguing that it " normalized " relations between palestinians and israel .
they said the project relied on cooperation with israel and that they opposed building a cinema while israel 's occupation army remained in the west bank .
vetter admits that he was discouraged .
" i did think then that the project might fail .
i thought that i ca n't keep giving my time to a project which has a fundamentalist approach .
it was very depressing , " said vetter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's still a long way to go on the building site but the faith of ordinary people in the project restored vetter 's commitment , as did the unswerving determination of ahmed khatib 's parents .
for them , cinema jenin is the fulfilment of a dream .
they want the town 's young people to have more of everything than their son had - more opportunities , more of a future , and of course more security .
when he died , ahmed saved the lives of the five children who received his organs .
with this movie theater , established in his memory , they hope he will touch the lives of countless more .
opening in time for world cup cinema jenin is now almost complete .

the ban " concerns securities that registered on a regulated german market , " a finance ministry said .
the ban also encompasses certain trades on currencies that are not used for hedging purposes .
a previous version of the draft law had envisaged a complete ban on short selling currency derivates .
naked short is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
but unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy them back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether .
it is viewed as a far riskier form of trading .
the practice came under fire after greece struggled to raise capital to finance its debt .
naked trades were blamed for artificially inflating the country 's funding costs .
last month , germany stunned its international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide with its plan to temporarily ban naked short selling of some financial shares , sovereign debt bonds and credit default swaps .
after berlin announced its ban last month , christoph schmidt , head of germany 's rwi economics institute , referred to the move as " an isolated step in a globalized world " and doubted it would have an impact .
indeed , most short selling takes place in london ; it is not a common practice in germany .
the draft bill must still be approved by the lower house of german parliament , the bundestag , where chancellor merkel 's coalition government holds a majority .
the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , can delay the bill but not block it indefinitely .

much of the action during monday 's pre-dawn raid by israeli commandos was focused on a turkish-flagged ship and at least four of the nine fatalities arising from the attack were pro-palestinian turks . in the days following , relations between turkey and israel have been strained to breaking point with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan calling the raid a " bloody massacre " and accusing israel of " unacceptable lawlessness . " erdogan has even gone so far as to refer to israel - a close partner since diplomatic ties with the jewish state were established in 1949 - as " a festering boil in the middle east that spreads hate and enmity , dynamites regional peace and spreads instability . " in such a situation , it is unsurprising that relations between turkey and israel are currently plummeting to an all-time low , even lower than when the relationship soured over israel 's military operations in gaza in 2008 .
but experts are also watching closely how relations between turkey and israel 's most powerful ally – the united states – will develop as the shockwaves from the flotilla raid ripple on . a furious erdogan wasted no time calling us president barack obama after the incident . " israel is faced with the danger of losing its sole friend in the region and the greatest contributor so far to regional peace , " erdogan told the us president in a one-hour telephone conversation , according to a turkish government statement on wednesday . bildunterschrift : erdogan suggested that turkey could abandon israel but trade and military ties remain too strong turkey-israel ties ' too strong to break ' turkey has been israel 's chief regional ally since a military cooperation deal was signed between the two countries in 1996 .
however , some sections of the us media claim the implication behind erdogan 's statement is that turkey , with its mainly muslim population , could shift its allegiance towards its new-found friends in the arab world , partners which the islamist-rooted government in ankara have been courting for some time . joost lagendijk , a senior advisor at the istanbul policy center , disagrees .
he believes that the connections between turkey and israel are too strong to be severed . " while we will see the two sides divided at an official , political level , turkey and israel will still have strong military and business ties , " he told deutsche welle . " it makes good sense to have good relations with the arabs but rejecting israel for the arabs is not a viable alternative . " while relations – especially those concerning trade – have been improving over the past few years with a host of arab nations , including syria , iran , lebanon and jordan , turkey still has its eyes set on europe and eu membership .
the european union is still the main power that turkey trusts most in the international arena , despite the eu 's continued ambivalence towards ankara 's accession hopes . however , some observers claim that the israeli raid offers turkey an opportunity to dangle the possibility of an eastward shift in the face of the united states to gain some leverage in a number of issues .
joost lagendijk believes it would be foolish to do so . " turkey 's standing in the middle east and its dealing with its arab partners are only possible because it has such good connections with both the us and the eu , ” he said .
“ that 's what makes turkey such an interesting partner to the arabs .
what would the value of turkey be without that ? " steven cook , a middle east expert at the council on foreign relations , believes turkey will pursue its own goals in the middle east and wo n't feel the need to pressure the us into supporting it . " turkey has economic , political and strategic interests in the arab middle east and turkish leaders obviously feel less inhibited to pursue their own interests in the region , regardless of washington 's wishes , " he told deutsche welle .
" the turks are willing to bend the regional rules of the game to serve ankara 's own interests .
if the resulting policies serve us goals at the same time , all well and good .
if not , so be it . " the united states may be closely watching turkey 's growing connection to regional arab powers but is unlikely to feel any threat from its closer ties with the likes of iran and syria .
despite its ambitions , turkey 's current economic and strategic power is still not enough to project discernible influence in the middle east and it still requires good relations with the us and eu to add weight to its status in the region . us looking to keep muslim ally turkey on side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain good relations with turkey bilateral relations by their nature have mutual benefits and turkey is n't the only partner seeking support .
the united states sees turkey as a key muslim ally and the obama administration has been working hard to repair the damage to relations caused by the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion . since then , the us and turkey have set-up intelligence sharing networks in the on-going fight against international terrorism while turkey hosts the us military infrastructure needed for its missions in neighbouring iraq and afghanistan . " turkey is still a key muslim ally to the us and is a favorite partner , one which is held up as an example of a predominantly islamic country with a growing democracy , " joost lagendijk said .
" the us wo n't want to jeapordise that .
if it turns on turkey for any reason , then the whole rhetoric washington has created about reforming the islamic world will crumble . " despite this , steven cook says , the two nations are increasingly finding themselves at odds with each other . " washington and ankara do share the same goals : peace between israel and the palestinians ; a stable , unified iraq ; an iran without nuclear weapons ; stability in afghanistan ; and a western-oriented syria , " he said . " when you get down to details , however , washington and ankara are on the opposite ends of virtually all these issues . " but after six decades of strategic cooperation , the stark reality is that while turkey and the united states are not enemies in the middle east , they are fast becoming strategic competitors . " turkey is asserting itself more in the middle east , where it has gone from a tepid observer to an influential player in eight short years , " cook added . washington faces balancing act with ankara , jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ties with israel will impact on its relations with turkey while turkey and the united states will not want to fall out , the situation arising from the israeli flotilla raid may still give turkey an opportunity to press its own agenda while maintaining strong ties with the us .
as pressure from the international community grows , turkey currently stands a greater chance at getting its own way over ending the blockade of gaza " the world has woken up to the gaza situation and now it is not only turkey calling for the end of the blockade , ” lagendijk said .
“ turkey , if it is clever , can use this to pressure the us which itself is growing more frustrated with the netanyahu government in israel .

" israel is faced with the danger of losing its sole friend in the region and the greatest contributor so far to regional peace , " erdogan told the us president in a one-hour telephone conversation , according to a turkish government statement on wednesday . bildunterschrift : erdogan suggested that turkey could abandon israel but trade and military ties remain too strong turkey-israel ties ' too strong to break ' turkey has been israel 's chief regional ally since a military cooperation deal was signed between the two countries in 1996 .
however , some sections of the us media claim the implication behind erdogan 's statement is that turkey , with its mainly muslim population , could shift its allegiance towards its new-found friends in the arab world , partners which the islamist-rooted government in ankara have been courting for some time . joost lagendijk , a senior advisor at the istanbul policy center , disagrees .
he believes that the connections between turkey and israel are too strong to be severed . " while we will see the two sides divided at an official , political level , turkey and israel will still have strong military and business ties , " he told deutsche welle . " it makes good sense to have good relations with the arabs but rejecting israel for the arabs is not a viable alternative . " while relations – especially those concerning trade – have been improving over the past few years with a host of arab nations , including syria , iran , lebanon and jordan , turkey still has its eyes set on europe and eu membership .
the european union is still the main power that turkey trusts most in the international arena , despite the eu 's continued ambivalence towards ankara 's accession hopes . however , some observers claim that the israeli raid offers turkey an opportunity to dangle the possibility of an eastward shift in the face of the united states to gain some leverage in a number of issues .
joost lagendijk believes it would be foolish to do so . " turkey 's standing in the middle east and its dealing with its arab partners are only possible because it has such good connections with both the us and the eu , ” he said .
“ that 's what makes turkey such an interesting partner to the arabs .
what would the value of turkey be without that ? " steven cook , a middle east expert at the council on foreign relations , believes turkey will pursue its own goals in the middle east and wo n't feel the need to pressure the us into supporting it . " turkey has economic , political and strategic interests in the arab middle east and turkish leaders obviously feel less inhibited to pursue their own interests in the region , regardless of washington 's wishes , " he told deutsche welle .
" the turks are willing to bend the regional rules of the game to serve ankara 's own interests .
if the resulting policies serve us goals at the same time , all well and good .
if not , so be it . " the united states may be closely watching turkey 's growing connection to regional arab powers but is unlikely to feel any threat from its closer ties with the likes of iran and syria .
despite its ambitions , turkey 's current economic and strategic power is still not enough to project discernible influence in the middle east and it still requires good relations with the us and eu to add weight to its status in the region . us looking to keep muslim ally turkey on side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain good relations with turkey bilateral relations by their nature have mutual benefits and turkey is n't the only partner seeking support .
the united states sees turkey as a key muslim ally and the obama administration has been working hard to repair the damage to relations caused by the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion . since then , the us and turkey have set-up intelligence sharing networks in the on-going fight against international terrorism while turkey hosts the us military infrastructure needed for its missions in neighbouring iraq and afghanistan . " turkey is still a key muslim ally to the us and is a favorite partner , one which is held up as an example of a predominantly islamic country with a growing democracy , " joost lagendijk said .
" the us wo n't want to jeapordise that .
if it turns on turkey for any reason , then the whole rhetoric washington has created about reforming the islamic world will crumble . " despite this , steven cook says , the two nations are increasingly finding themselves at odds with each other . " washington and ankara do share the same goals : peace between israel and the palestinians ; a stable , unified iraq ; an iran without nuclear weapons ; stability in afghanistan ; and a western-oriented syria , " he said . " when you get down to details , however , washington and ankara are on the opposite ends of virtually all these issues . " but after six decades of strategic cooperation , the stark reality is that while turkey and the united states are not enemies in the middle east , they are fast becoming strategic competitors . " turkey is asserting itself more in the middle east , where it has gone from a tepid observer to an influential player in eight short years , " cook added . washington faces balancing act with ankara , jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ties with israel will impact on its relations with turkey while turkey and the united states will not want to fall out , the situation arising from the israeli flotilla raid may still give turkey an opportunity to press its own agenda while maintaining strong ties with the us .
as pressure from the international community grows , turkey currently stands a greater chance at getting its own way over ending the blockade of gaza " the world has woken up to the gaza situation and now it is not only turkey calling for the end of the blockade , ” lagendijk said .
“ turkey , if it is clever , can use this to pressure the us which itself is growing more frustrated with the netanyahu government in israel .
maybe this will lead to the us calling for an end to the embargo . " author : nick amies editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , his surprise resignation may jeopardize the success of his african projects . as the german president , horst koehler travelled the world .
on state visits , people saw a president that was interested in different cultures and societies .
but koehler was always fond of one continent in particular : africa .
he did not overlook africa 's ills and when he described them , he did not mince his words either .
but with koehler having left office , there is a looming danger that africa will fall back to the bottom of the political agenda in germany again .
new german presidents usually do not continue projects started by their predecessors , because they want to set their own political focus .
in this case , it likely wo n't include africa .
that is a shame , say experts , because when it came to corruption , civil war or lack of political leadership , the former president said what he thought – even if he was addressing african heads of state at the african union 's assembly .
at the same time , he did not ignore the many positive signs on the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler dances with ghanian president john agyekum kufuor in 2007 " civil society is growing across africa .
more and more people refuse to give in to their destinies .
farmers come together to buy fertilizer or to build wells .
civil society groups fight against corruption and put their governments to task .
women take the initiative to built schools or clinics for aids patients , ” koehler once said in a speech .
whether it was praise or criticism – horst koehler 's main priority was to establish a dialogue of equals between africans and germans .
in his first speech to parliament in july 2004 , koehler made it clear that africa was a priority for him .
" it is my conviction that the humanity of our world will be measured against the fate of africa , " koehler told members of germany 's lower house , the bundestag .
imf legacy troublesome at first but most african leaders did not start cheering at his words right away .
" there were many people in africa in the beginning that automatically identified horst koehler with the international monetary fund , " said ulf engel , a scholar in the africa department of the university of leipzig .
koehler had been at the helm of the international monetary fund until he was elected president .
the fund is notorious in africa for koehler 's structural adjustment policies , cost-cutting measures aimed at reducing public debts .
the imf forced various african countries to introduce school fees or make visits to the hospital more expensive as part of structural adjustment .
but koehler soon managed to change his perception in africa through his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited a youth center in rwanda in 2008 “ he gained a lot of popularity in africa when he started his ' partnership with africa ' initiative , " said engel .
partnership with africa was koehler 's pet project .
it was his attempt to make a direct contribution to the establishment of a dialogue of equals in real life .
it was n't just members of germany 's and africa 's political and business elite who discussed topics such as the difficult relationship between africa and europe or the challenges faced by africa 's youth .
promising young people known as " future leaders " from africa and germany also always sat at the table .
all words , no action ?
critics sometimes commented that the meetings were just another talking shop .
they liked to complain that africa did not need more words , but action .
but as the university of leipzig 's engel says , koehler was able to consistently make a clear statement about the policies regarding africa .
" some politicians were clearly uncomfortable when he took a firm stand on issues that he felt the west needed to change .
a reduction of subsidies for western products for instance , or the need to take africa seriously , " engel said .
germany 's constitution did not give koehler much room to put his political ideas into practice .
according to the law , the president has little political power .
instead , he had to use the power of words to influence german politics , and that power was n't always enough .
“ it 's tragic that he did not manage to make politicians in berlin listen to him , " said engel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 02.06.2010 with cinema jenin , a dream is fulfilled for palestinian youth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the restoration was driven by the parents of ahmed khatib german filmmaker marcus vetter is close to completing the restoration of a cinema in jenin , a town in the palestinian west bank .
the cinema was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago . marcus vetter made a film in jenin three years ago - and stayed on to build a cinema in which to show it .
his documentary film , " the heart of jenin , " is about ahmed khatib , a palestinian boy killed by israeli troops while playing with a toy gun in the town 's refugee camp .
his parents decided to donate their son 's organs to save the lives of other children - arab and israeli .
the documentary won several awards , but it could n't be shown in jenin , where it all happened .
the town 's only movie theater was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago .
ahmed 's parents asked vetter to help renovate and reopen it , because they wanted to create more opportunities for local children .
he agreed , although he 'd never funded or managed a building project before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcus vetter with one of the palestinian teens who 's been helping on the project " you ca n't open such a place just by helping .
it 's impossible as i realized very fast .
this is real work .
what i could have helped with was fundraising , but raising money is nothing - raising money just means corruption , " said vetter .
vetter has run things in an unorthodox way .
he did n't apply for funding before starting .
he just began , with no salaries at all to pay the german architects and engineers .
they 're volunteers .
" just take a step , that 's what we did here , just renovate , do n't talk all the time , and do it with all your passion , " said vetter .
the project is ambitious .
vetter and his team are renovating the old indoor cinema , building an outdoor one , adding a cafe and guest house , as well as setting up a film production and distribution company .
government , private donors covered costs so far , the project has cost more than half a million euros .
most of the money has come from the german government , with the rest from corporate donors and ordinary people .
along the way , money has always been tight .
earlier this year , vetter simply ran out of cash .
he wrote to six donors saying he needed 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- to finish the job .
only one of them replied - legendary british musician roger waters , of pink floyd fame .
" having met all the people involved i felt connected to them and i felt it was the least i could do to give them the money to finish the project , " said waters , talking by phone from the united states .
waters says he was inspired to help by the generosity of ahmed khatib 's father .
" this project was fundamentally and always attached to that story , that incredibly moving story .
he gives the rest of us hope that we may at some point find a partial solution to the plight the palestinian people find themselves in , " said waters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck delivers all the technical equipment to the cinema dialogue with other cultures fakhri hamad , the project manager for cinema jenin , says the project is changing the town .
" we started with a small idea to have a place for kids to play and learn but it 's had local and international support , and it 's grown and grown .
now it 's become a project of the town itself .
jenin has the chance to prove it 's ready to accept other cultures , to accept peace and to accept dialogue , " said hamad .
it 's been a huge turnaround for jenin , a town with a population of around 250,000 which became known as the source of a third of the suicide bombers of the palestinian uprising known as the second intifada .
now , young palestinians are learning about filmmaking side by side with german students , as well as working on the building site together .
opposition from intellectuals but there has been some palestinian opposition to the project .
earlier this year , palestinian intellectuals criticized cinema jenin , arguing that it " normalized " relations between palestinians and israel .
they said the project relied on cooperation with israel and that they opposed building a cinema while israel 's occupation army remained in the west bank .
vetter admits that he was discouraged .
" i did think then that the project might fail .
i thought that i ca n't keep giving my time to a project which has a fundamentalist approach .
it was very depressing , " said vetter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's still a long way to go on the building site but the faith of ordinary people in the project restored vetter 's commitment , as did the unswerving determination of ahmed khatib 's parents .
for them , cinema jenin is the fulfilment of a dream .
they want the town 's young people to have more of everything than their son had - more opportunities , more of a future , and of course more security .
when he died , ahmed saved the lives of the five children who received his organs .
with this movie theater , established in his memory , they hope he will touch the lives of countless more .
opening in time for world cup cinema jenin is now almost complete .
the members of the project team hope to open the outdoor cinema in time for the world cup later this month .
the official opening of the restored indoor cinema is scheduled for august .

when asked whether she would be interested in the job , von der leyen avoided any concrete statements of intent but there 's little doubt she has the confidence to take over from horst koehler .
" we now need to find a good solution for the country under extreme time pressure , " she said .
" i think it 's very important that the president enjoys a high level of trust from the people . "
von der leyen started her political career rather late but quickly rose through the party ranks .
it was not until 1990 that she joined the conservative christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
she first studied economics and later medicine before going on to work as a doctor and in research .
she entered local politics in 1991 and less than two years later was elected into the state parliament of lower saxony , where became minister for social affairs .
in 2005 chancellor angela merkel took her to berlin to become family minister .
modernizing family policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen was the driving force behind providing better child care herself a mother of seven , von der leyen played a crucial role in the cdu winning over new voters by modernizing the party 's all too conservative family policy .
she successfully fought for a modern , social familiy policy to give , for example , single mothers better career chances .
in 2009 , von der leyen became germany 's new labor minister after franz josef jung resigned .
her new post has seen her popularity undiminished as the german labor market seemed to withstand the expected downturn in the wake of the global economic crisis .
initial opinion polls suggest that von der leyen is the politician who can muster more popular support than any of the other possible successors to koehler .
40 percent of the population are in favor of a woman taking over the country 's most senior post , while 25 percent would like to see von der leyen herself take over .
the post of president is largely ceremonial in germany , and the incumbent usually abstains from commenting on party politics .
the president is however expected to act as a moral authority in wider national debates .
popular and political backing born in 1958 , von der leyen hails from a family with a longstanding tradition in politics .
her father was former state premier of lower saxony ernst albrecht , who also worked in brussels for the eu 's predecessor , the european community .
von der leyen spent the first few years of her life in belgium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christian democrat would be germany 's first woman president her husband is a professor of medicine heiko von der leyen .
he counts among his ancestors a number of prince electors , who for centuries determined the succession of german emperors .
cross-party backing the leader of the opposition , social democrat sigmar gabriel , has called for all parties to be included in the talks on who should succeed koehler .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition however is expected to hold the majority in the federal convention , the body responsible for the selection of the next president .
merkel has indicated they would try to find someone who would be accepted across the political spectrum .
should berlin opt for ursula von der leyen , the government will likely have indeed picked a candidate that both the ruling coalition as well as many opposition politicians would support. ai / dpa / reuters / apn editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

swedish foreign minister carl bildt was among the european leaders in sarajevo lending his support to some balkan nations bidding to join the eu .
" there are a number of countries where enthusiasm for enlargement is less than 100 percent these days .
then it is important that we come here to reaffirm and say ... the door is open , " bildt said .
of the nations that emerged from the violent collapse of yugoslavia in the 1990s , slovenia has already joined the eu , croatia is close to membership and serbia , montenegro and macedonia have applied .
to the south , albania has also applied .
bosnia , which remains an international protectorate divided along ethnic lines , and kosovo , whose independence serbia and some eu states do not recognise , are lagging behind .
balkans welcome in light of the ongoing debt crisis in europe , there was some concern in the balkans that progress would be bogged down on absorbing new nations into the block .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign affairs chief catherine ashton with bosnia -lrb- r -rrb- and spain -lrb- l -rrb- foreign ministers at the meeting but bildt added that he expected " strong reaffirmation by the eu " encouraging the balkan nations to push on with their efforts to join the eu .
spain , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency and organized the meeting , added that balkan countries were welcome in the eu " a very good future for the whole region , a european future , and a commitment of the international community to support all western balkans to join the eu , that is the main message today , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos .
however , many balkan states will be hoping more than rhetoric comes out of the meeting .
this could come in the form of extending the right to travel without visas in the eu 's schengen zone to bosnia and albania , an idea put forth in brussels last week .
this right has already been given to serbia , montenegro and macedonia .
conference downgraded the sarajevo conference was originally planned as a summit , but reconfigured as informal talks because of the current row between serbia and its former province kosovo .
belgrade refuses to acknowledge kosovo , which declared independence from serbia in 2008 , and serbian officials insist they will not formally share any table with their kosovo counterparts . because the conference has revised its format , it will now not issue any formal declaration at the end of proceedings. mz / cb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 02.06.2010 irascible german literary critic reich-ranicki turns 90 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki had an idea early on of a new style of literary criticism marcel reich-ranicki is germany 's best known literary critic .
his long career and definitive pronouncements have earned him the irreverent nickname " the pope of german letters . "
on june 2 , he turns 90 . marcel reich-ranicki was in charge of the literature section of the national newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in the 1970s , and hosted the television book discussion program " literary quartet " throughout the 1990 's .
these and many other public appearances where he freely made his pronouncements on german books and writing have made him one of germany 's best-known cultural critics .
reich-ranicki , who is celebrating his 90th birthday on june 2 , is also one of just a handful of jewish public figures in germany to resettle in the country after having survived world war ii .
born in 1920 in wloclawek , poland , the future critic attended high school in berlin .
because he was jewish , he was denied entry to the university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the critic , just ending his ninth decade , is still up for an argument after being deported to poland , reich-ranicki was able to flee the warsaw ghetto with his wife , tosia .
in 1958 , he returned to germany and dedicated himself to the study of german language and literature - and saw an opening for himself in the world of german letters .
risky career move " when i came to germany in ' 58 , and i saw what people were writing about literature in the -lsb- newspapers here , -rsb- i told my wife : i want to do an experiment , " reich-ranicki said in an acceptance speech after receiving the north rhine-westphalia state prize in 2005 .
" these people write so confusingly , so cryptically , i just do n't like their criticism , " he continued .
" i will say loud and clear what i think about books .
it is risky , and two things could happen : i will either rise to the top of the literary criticism hierarchy , or sink to the very bottom .
but i have to try . "
reich-ranicki has remained incorruptible and sharp in his opinions , and he does n't mince words .
that attitude has cost him a few friends over the years .
his dedication to speaking the truth as he sees it was behind a major uproar in 2008 , when he was invited to receive an honorary german television prize for his cultural contributions .
as recipients awaiting awards usually do , he sat passively in the audience as one tv personality after another came up to make a speech , accept an award , or tell a few jokes .
critic who speaks his mind he was definitely not impressed with what he saw - and he made no secret of his feelings .
when the time came for him to accept his honorary award , he stunned viewers by rejecting it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel awarded reich-ranicki the henri-nannen prize in 2008 " i can not accept this prize , " reich-ranicki told the shocked audience .
" i did n't know what to expect here , and i think it is awful that i had to sit through this for so many hours . "
at first , some of the guests at the ceremony thought reich-ranicki was joking .
but in this case he was simply telling it like he saw it - live and on the air .
by giving an open , radical critique of what he saw as the poor state of german television , reich-ranicki underlined his reputation as something of a crank , not to mention a " hard taskmaster " and a " a specialist in executions , " as different critics have put it .
reich-ranicki answers his detractors by saying that indeed , his first and foremost job is to be tough and critical .
years on ' literary quartet ' " being called an ' execution specialist ' is really nonsense , " reich-ranicki told broadcaster wdr in a 1986 interview .
" but i try to be clear in my criticism .
and the clarity of criticism , well , that is a question of politesse .
you have to be polite to the readers .
and that means being clear and explicit with your meaning , not hiding behind ambiguous or enigmatic phrases . "
his appearances as the head critic on television 's " literary quartet " between 1988 and 2001 brought reich-ranicki to the small screen some 77 times - automatically launching him to the top of germany 's lit-crit pop cultural heap .
despite his fame , however , he certainly is n't infallible .
and if he had a reputation for judging literature based more on his personal reading preferences than on serious criticism , well , that did n't stop his opinion from making and breaking many a literary career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his 2008 rejection of the german tv prize came as a shock those who raised his wrath - peter handke , guenter grass or martin walser , for example - had to fight their way into the market .
on the contrary , favorites such as spanish writer javier marias or berlin chronicler judith hermann more or less owe their success to reich-ranicki 's praises .
boring book ?
bad news the worst thing that reich-ranicki could say about a book was : " boring . "
his anti-academic , folksy and agreeably polemical ideas about literature can most likely be traced back to his own , sad biography .
as a persecuted jew he escaped the warsaw ghetto and various deportations , as though by a miracle .
at the time , a polish printer hid reich-ranicki and his wife from the nazis .
in payment , the literature lover regaled his benefactors with an endless slew of stories : shakespeare , goethe , schiller , etc .
telling stories to stay alive - the experience made a lasting impression on reich-ranicki , whose biggest successes came when he broke literary-criticism taboos .
years later , he wrote his own life story , and - unlike the biographies of many other critics - this one became a bestseller .

some analysts are saying the next days will be crucial for its future . in an editorial , the website of german public broadcaster zdf said " the fate of this -lsb- government -rsb- coalition will be decided in the next ten days . "
that 's a drastic view , but there 's no doubt that the resignation of the german president , horst koehler , on monday has delivered a major blow to the government .
it has many important issues to be dealing with : the crisis in the eurozone , the need for drastic savings , or the military involvement in afghanistan , to mention just a few .
and the government coalition , made up of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , has a few crises of its own : the poor showing of the two parties in the indecisive regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the sudden resignation of powerful regional leader roland koch in hessen , the internal backbiting within the liberal party , and disastrous opinion poll ratings .
so the chancellor , angela merkel , could well do without the scramble to find a convincing new president within 30 days , as required by the constitution .
is it a crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she regretted koehler 's departure and had tried to change his mind in a major interview on the evening of koehler 's resignation , she insisted , " we have to be sure not to make a crisis out of every challenge . "
but peter stuetzle , head of deutsche welle 's berlin office , thinks that a crisis is exactly what this is .
" this has been one too much for the government , " he says .
" there 's been a lot of trouble , and the government was just about to try to leave all that behind , and in this minute , koehler resigns . "
if the current government were doing well , the resignation would just be a nuisance , but it 's a sign of the government 's problems that the nuisance was immediately seen as a crisis .
all at sea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's coalition partners have already said they 'll leave the choice up to her wolfgang bosbach , a senior cdu backbencher , says that people do n't trust politicians of any party to solve the country 's problems , and so when respected figures like koehler or koch resign , the people feel that " the good people have left the ship , and we do n't how we will carry on in this rough sea . " what he , as a government supporter , fails to mention , is that , even if the people are disillusioned with all politicians , it 's his coalition which has the power to pilot the ship , and so that 's where the criticism hits particularly hard .
merkel has often been criticized for her lack of leadership - she tends to sit things out and wait until a consensus emerges - but the choice of a new president will require decisive action . peter stuetzle thinks the whole coalition has recognized the need .
her partners - not just the liberals , but also her bavarian sister-party , the csu - have agreed that they will do without their own candidates , and let her make the choice . " everything will be very fast , " he thinks , " and if it 's fast , and if it 's convincing too , then the government might even come out of the whole thing with a better public image at the end of the day . "

she denounces the government 's anti-maoist offensive , which has been codenamed operation green hunt . " it has gone terribly wrong , " she told deutsche welle .
" to try and sort out this very deep problem militarily is to create a situation , which is quickly spiraling out of anybody 's ability to extract any kind of morality out of the various atrocities that are taking place .
unless they try to negotiate some kind of ceasefire , somehow , i do n't see how it is going to be sorted out .
i do n't even know whether talks can sort it out but certainly they have to try another tack . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 50,000 paramilitary troops are involved in operation green hunt the offensive to quell the maoist rebellion in the rural heartland involves 56,000 paramilitary troops in six states . offensive linked to economic interests roy claims the offensive is closely linked with economic interests .

swedish foreign minister carl bildt was among the european leaders in sarajevo lending his support to some balkan nations bidding to join the eu .
" there are a number of countries where enthusiasm for enlargement is less than 100 percent these days .
then it is important that we come here to reaffirm and say ... the door is open , " bildt said .
of the nations that emerged from the violent collapse of yugoslavia in the 1990s , slovenia has already joined the eu , croatia is close to membership and serbia , montenegro and macedonia have applied .
to the south , albania has also applied .
bosnia , which remains an international protectorate divided along ethnic lines , and kosovo , whose independence serbia and some eu states do not recognise , are lagging behind .
balkans welcome in light of the ongoing debt crisis in europe , there was some concern in the balkans that progress would be bogged down on absorbing new nations into the block .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign affairs chief catherine ashton with bosnia -lrb- r -rrb- and spain -lrb- l -rrb- foreign ministers at the meeting but bildt added that he expected " strong reaffirmation by the eu " encouraging the balkan nations to push on with their efforts to join the eu .
spain , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency and organized the meeting , added that balkan countries were welcome in the eu " a very good future for the whole region , a european future , and a commitment of the international community to support all western balkans to join the eu , that is the main message today , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos .
however , many balkan states will be hoping more than rhetoric comes out of the meeting .
this could come in the form of extending the right to travel without visas in the eu 's schengen zone to bosnia and albania , an idea put forth in brussels last week .
this right has already been given to serbia , montenegro and macedonia .
conference downgraded the sarajevo conference was originally planned as a summit , but reconfigured as informal talks because of the current row between serbia and its former province kosovo .
belgrade refuses to acknowledge kosovo , which declared independence from serbia in 2008 , and serbian officials insist they will not formally share any table with their kosovo counterparts . because the conference has revised its format , it will now not issue any formal declaration at the end of proceedings. mz / cb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the cinema was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago . marcus vetter made a film in jenin three years ago - and stayed on to build a cinema in which to show it .
his documentary film , " the heart of jenin , " is about ahmed khatib , a palestinian boy killed by israeli troops while playing with a toy gun in the town 's refugee camp .
his parents decided to donate their son 's organs to save the lives of other children - arab and israeli .
the documentary won several awards , but it could n't be shown in jenin , where it all happened .
the town 's only movie theater was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago .
ahmed 's parents asked vetter to help renovate and reopen it , because they wanted to create more opportunities for local children .
he agreed , although he 'd never funded or managed a building project before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcus vetter with one of the palestinian teens who 's been helping on the project " you ca n't open such a place just by helping .
it 's impossible as i realized very fast .
this is real work .
what i could have helped with was fundraising , but raising money is nothing - raising money just means corruption , " said vetter .
vetter has run things in an unorthodox way .
he did n't apply for funding before starting .
he just began , with no salaries at all to pay the german architects and engineers .
they 're volunteers .
" just take a step , that 's what we did here , just renovate , do n't talk all the time , and do it with all your passion , " said vetter .
the project is ambitious .
vetter and his team are renovating the old indoor cinema , building an outdoor one , adding a cafe and guest house , as well as setting up a film production and distribution company .
government , private donors covered costs so far , the project has cost more than half a million euros .
most of the money has come from the german government , with the rest from corporate donors and ordinary people .
along the way , money has always been tight .
earlier this year , vetter simply ran out of cash .
he wrote to six donors saying he needed 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- to finish the job .
only one of them replied - legendary british musician roger waters , of pink floyd fame .
" having met all the people involved i felt connected to them and i felt it was the least i could do to give them the money to finish the project , " said waters , talking by phone from the united states .
waters says he was inspired to help by the generosity of ahmed khatib 's father .
" this project was fundamentally and always attached to that story , that incredibly moving story .
he gives the rest of us hope that we may at some point find a partial solution to the plight the palestinian people find themselves in , " said waters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck delivers all the technical equipment to the cinema dialogue with other cultures fakhri hamad , the project manager for cinema jenin , says the project is changing the town .
" we started with a small idea to have a place for kids to play and learn but it 's had local and international support , and it 's grown and grown .
now it 's become a project of the town itself .
jenin has the chance to prove it 's ready to accept other cultures , to accept peace and to accept dialogue , " said hamad .
it 's been a huge turnaround for jenin , a town with a population of around 250,000 which became known as the source of a third of the suicide bombers of the palestinian uprising known as the second intifada .
now , young palestinians are learning about filmmaking side by side with german students , as well as working on the building site together .
opposition from intellectuals but there has been some palestinian opposition to the project .
earlier this year , palestinian intellectuals criticized cinema jenin , arguing that it " normalized " relations between palestinians and israel .
they said the project relied on cooperation with israel and that they opposed building a cinema while israel 's occupation army remained in the west bank .
vetter admits that he was discouraged .
" i did think then that the project might fail .
i thought that i ca n't keep giving my time to a project which has a fundamentalist approach .
it was very depressing , " said vetter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's still a long way to go on the building site but the faith of ordinary people in the project restored vetter 's commitment , as did the unswerving determination of ahmed khatib 's parents .
for them , cinema jenin is the fulfilment of a dream .
they want the town 's young people to have more of everything than their son had - more opportunities , more of a future , and of course more security .
when he died , ahmed saved the lives of the five children who received his organs .
with this movie theater , established in his memory , they hope he will touch the lives of countless more .
opening in time for world cup cinema jenin is now almost complete .
the members of the project team hope to open the outdoor cinema in time for the world cup later this month .
the official opening of the restored indoor cinema is scheduled for august .

the defense ministry is expected to tighten its belt , which could lead to a reduction of bundeswehr troops . cutting troop numbers in the german bundeswehr is one option under consideration as the german government prepares to meet on sunday and monday to come up with ways to plug large gaps in its deficit-laden budget .
german military spending is one area where significant savings could be made and according to media reports , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is considering several money-saving measures .
one consideration would be a reduction in the number of bundeswehr soldiers by nearly half .
according to the suttgarter zeitung and the hamburger abendblatt newspapers , one possibility would be to cut the number of troops from around 250,000 to 150,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is hoping to slash a billion euros from the defense budget another option would be eliminating germany 's mandatory military service .
the hamburger abendblatt wrote that this could result in savings of around 400 million euros -lrb- $ 489 million -rrb- .
it would represent a large chunk of the 1 billion euros the defense ministry hopes to cut from its 31-billion-euro budget .
a law has already been introduced in the german parliament that would reduce the length of military service from nine to six months .
a spokesperson from the defense ministry was quoted by the hamburger abendblatt as saying that " no ideas -lsb- for cutting costs -rsb- were off limits , but no decisions had yet been made .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 02.06.2010 turkey and us face tough decisions on relations after israeli flotilla raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as turkey 's relations with israel dive , ankara looks to the us while its relations with israel continue to plummet to new depths in the wake of the gaza flotilla raid , turkey is considering how to handle the us as washington tries to balance its ties with jerusalem and ankara . few countries are more enraged by israel 's raid on the gaza aid flotilla than turkey .
much of the action during monday 's pre-dawn raid by israeli commandos was focused on a turkish-flagged ship and at least four of the nine fatalities arising from the attack were pro-palestinian turks . in the days following , relations between turkey and israel have been strained to breaking point with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan calling the raid a " bloody massacre " and accusing israel of " unacceptable lawlessness . " erdogan has even gone so far as to refer to israel - a close partner since diplomatic ties with the jewish state were established in 1949 - as " a festering boil in the middle east that spreads hate and enmity , dynamites regional peace and spreads instability . " in such a situation , it is unsurprising that relations between turkey and israel are currently plummeting to an all-time low , even lower than when the relationship soured over israel 's military operations in gaza in 2008 .
but experts are also watching closely how relations between turkey and israel 's most powerful ally – the united states – will develop as the shockwaves from the flotilla raid ripple on . a furious erdogan wasted no time calling us president barack obama after the incident . " israel is faced with the danger of losing its sole friend in the region and the greatest contributor so far to regional peace , " erdogan told the us president in a one-hour telephone conversation , according to a turkish government statement on wednesday . bildunterschrift : erdogan suggested that turkey could abandon israel but trade and military ties remain too strong turkey-israel ties ' too strong to break ' turkey has been israel 's chief regional ally since a military cooperation deal was signed between the two countries in 1996 .
however , some sections of the us media claim the implication behind erdogan 's statement is that turkey , with its mainly muslim population , could shift its allegiance towards its new-found friends in the arab world , partners which the islamist-rooted government in ankara have been courting for some time . joost lagendijk , a senior advisor at the istanbul policy center , disagrees .
he believes that the connections between turkey and israel are too strong to be severed . " while we will see the two sides divided at an official , political level , turkey and israel will still have strong military and business ties , " he told deutsche welle . " it makes good sense to have good relations with the arabs but rejecting israel for the arabs is not a viable alternative . " while relations – especially those concerning trade – have been improving over the past few years with a host of arab nations , including syria , iran , lebanon and jordan , turkey still has its eyes set on europe and eu membership .
the european union is still the main power that turkey trusts most in the international arena , despite the eu 's continued ambivalence towards ankara 's accession hopes . however , some observers claim that the israeli raid offers turkey an opportunity to dangle the possibility of an eastward shift in the face of the united states to gain some leverage in a number of issues .
joost lagendijk believes it would be foolish to do so . " turkey 's standing in the middle east and its dealing with its arab partners are only possible because it has such good connections with both the us and the eu , ” he said .
“ that 's what makes turkey such an interesting partner to the arabs .
what would the value of turkey be without that ? " steven cook , a middle east expert at the council on foreign relations , believes turkey will pursue its own goals in the middle east and wo n't feel the need to pressure the us into supporting it . " turkey has economic , political and strategic interests in the arab middle east and turkish leaders obviously feel less inhibited to pursue their own interests in the region , regardless of washington 's wishes , " he told deutsche welle .
" the turks are willing to bend the regional rules of the game to serve ankara 's own interests .
if the resulting policies serve us goals at the same time , all well and good .
if not , so be it . " the united states may be closely watching turkey 's growing connection to regional arab powers but is unlikely to feel any threat from its closer ties with the likes of iran and syria .
despite its ambitions , turkey 's current economic and strategic power is still not enough to project discernible influence in the middle east and it still requires good relations with the us and eu to add weight to its status in the region . us looking to keep muslim ally turkey on side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain good relations with turkey bilateral relations by their nature have mutual benefits and turkey is n't the only partner seeking support .
the united states sees turkey as a key muslim ally and the obama administration has been working hard to repair the damage to relations caused by the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion . since then , the us and turkey have set-up intelligence sharing networks in the on-going fight against international terrorism while turkey hosts the us military infrastructure needed for its missions in neighbouring iraq and afghanistan . " turkey is still a key muslim ally to the us and is a favorite partner , one which is held up as an example of a predominantly islamic country with a growing democracy , " joost lagendijk said .
" the us wo n't want to jeapordise that .
if it turns on turkey for any reason , then the whole rhetoric washington has created about reforming the islamic world will crumble . " despite this , steven cook says , the two nations are increasingly finding themselves at odds with each other . " washington and ankara do share the same goals : peace between israel and the palestinians ; a stable , unified iraq ; an iran without nuclear weapons ; stability in afghanistan ; and a western-oriented syria , " he said . " when you get down to details , however , washington and ankara are on the opposite ends of virtually all these issues . " but after six decades of strategic cooperation , the stark reality is that while turkey and the united states are not enemies in the middle east , they are fast becoming strategic competitors . " turkey is asserting itself more in the middle east , where it has gone from a tepid observer to an influential player in eight short years , " cook added . washington faces balancing act with ankara , jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ties with israel will impact on its relations with turkey while turkey and the united states will not want to fall out , the situation arising from the israeli flotilla raid may still give turkey an opportunity to press its own agenda while maintaining strong ties with the us .
as pressure from the international community grows , turkey currently stands a greater chance at getting its own way over ending the blockade of gaza " the world has woken up to the gaza situation and now it is not only turkey calling for the end of the blockade , ” lagendijk said .
“ turkey , if it is clever , can use this to pressure the us which itself is growing more frustrated with the netanyahu government in israel .
maybe this will lead to the us calling for an end to the embargo . " author : nick amies editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new guidelines provide stricter transparency guidelines , and place cra regulation under the authority of the european securities and markets authority -lrb- esma -rrb- , which the commission established last year and is due to come into force at the start of 2011 .
the esma would have the authority to impose sanctions on agencies , and even withdraw their licenses when they fail to comply with regulations .
the three main credit rating agencies , standard & poor 's , moody 's and fitch , had operated with significant latitude before the eu began issuing licenses and demanding a certain level of transparency just last year , according to karel lannoo , director of the european credit research institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lowered bond ratings have made it hard for greece to finance its budget " when the financial crisis started in 2007 , it was very clear that the ratings which the rating agencies gave were not based on pure objective facts , " he told deutsche welle .
" there were huge conflicts of interest .
that 's why the eu was then convinced that there should be a piece of regulation . "
case for regulation one function of rating agencies is to rate the risk of government bonds , using a scale of aaa for the most secure to d for an almost certain default .
the agencies then sell these ratings to investors and banks .
the conflict of interest appears when the agencies rate the very institutions that buy their services , said robert halver , stock analyst for baader bank .
" the rating agencies finance themselves very strongly with the sale of analytical instruments on pension funds , insurance agencies and banks , because everyone assumes that they have a lot of knowledge about country 's risks , " he told deutsche welle .
another reason for further regulation is the role cras have played in crises related to the public finance of budgets , most notably in greece but also in spain , portugal and italy , said lannoo .
when ratings agencies devalue government bonds , it creates a problem of " systemic stability . "
" all of a sudden these ratings agencies have drastically downgraded the debt of these countries , which as given rise to systemic effects , in the sense that many investors have started to sell the securities or the bonds of these countries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker has proposed a new cra close to the european central bank more competition halver said one solution to europe 's problem with cras would be the creation of a european rating agency to compete with the " big three , " as long as it was n't under the supervision of a public entity like the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- or the european commission , as eurogroup president jean-claude juncker recently suggested .
" then there would be suspicion that they would exercise their influence and try to sugarcoat negative evaluations , " he said .
" that can not happen . "
lannoo said the big three already have a european component in fitch , whose main shareholder is european .
rather than constructing a new european rating agency , he said regulators should instead make it easier for already-existing agencies to be licensed as cras .
" what in fact we need to do is ... to lower the entry barriers into the sector , " he said .
" but what we in fact have done with this european regulation now is just the opposite - we have increased the entry thresholds because it 's extremely difficult to be in line with this piece of regulation . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 02.06.2010 bestselling indian novelist says operation green hunt has gone awry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian author arundhati roy is often present at protests the acclaimed indian writer and activist arundhati roy who is a staunch critic of the ongoing armed offensive against the maoist rebels in india argues that the government 's strategy has gone terribly wrong . the booker prize winner arundhati roy , who wrote the 1997 bestseller " the god of small things " , is also known internationally for her campaigns against the violence of states and private corporations .
she denounces the government 's anti-maoist offensive , which has been codenamed operation green hunt . " it has gone terribly wrong , " she told deutsche welle .
" to try and sort out this very deep problem militarily is to create a situation , which is quickly spiraling out of anybody 's ability to extract any kind of morality out of the various atrocities that are taking place .
unless they try to negotiate some kind of ceasefire , somehow , i do n't see how it is going to be sorted out .
i do n't even know whether talks can sort it out but certainly they have to try another tack . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 50,000 paramilitary troops are involved in operation green hunt the offensive to quell the maoist rebellion in the rural heartland involves 56,000 paramilitary troops in six states . offensive linked to economic interests roy claims the offensive is closely linked with economic interests .
" in states like orissa and jharkand , the security forces are moving against everybody resisting the takeover of their land by mining corporations , " she said . " millions of people are displaced from their lands by a government which is taking over resources .
i hate that word but they are taking over mountains , forests and land to hand them over to corporations .
hundreds and hundreds of mous have been signed .
environmental engineering and social engineering is taking place in the country .
anybody who thwarts that plan , whether maoists , gandhians or gandhian socialists or whoever they are , the minute somebody raises their voice or if somebody is effective , security moves against them .
they do n't mind dissent as long as they know it is entirely ineffective . " after meeting maoist guerrillas in their forest base earlier this year , roy penned a 20,000 word essay , arguing that the maoists had a point when they say the gap between the rich and the poor has increased .
the levers of government , she maintained , are increasingly controlled by private entities . " india today is a country where a lot of the growth rate is fuelled by this mining money , " she reiterated to deutsche welle .
" this situation is not new .
latin america has seen it , africa has seen it .
the kind of money you are talking about is so great that you can buy governments , buy the media , buy the courts , you can buy the whole country .
you can run the country and these people are gradually running the country .
the elections are not between the bjp , congress or the samajwadi party .
they are between the ambanis , the tatas , the mittals – the people pulling the strings now . " " two-pronged strategy is moronic " this situation is what makes the current offensive against the maoists even more absurd , she argues .
" this two-pronged strategy is moronic because the government 's idea of development is what caused the problem in the first place , " she said . " how are you going to solve it by what 's creating the problem as well as a military assault ?
operation green hunt is being built up as a war – they do n't want to use the word war but as an offensive let 's say – against the communist party of india -lrb- maoist -rrb- , which is a banned party . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last week , over 140 people were killed when a mumbai-bound train derailed .
the accident was blamed on the maoists .
the debate around the maoists in indian society is polarized – some support military action , others such as roy and certain rights activists say the rebels are a symptom of social inequity and decry the military offensive . the discussion is not likely to subside and has become more heated of late , as maoist attacks have become more deadly , increasingly targeting security personnel and even civilians . author : murali krishnan -lrb- new delhi -rrb- editor : anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , his surprise resignation may jeopardize the success of his african projects . as the german president , horst koehler travelled the world .
on state visits , people saw a president that was interested in different cultures and societies .
but koehler was always fond of one continent in particular : africa .
he did not overlook africa 's ills and when he described them , he did not mince his words either .
but with koehler having left office , there is a looming danger that africa will fall back to the bottom of the political agenda in germany again .
new german presidents usually do not continue projects started by their predecessors , because they want to set their own political focus .
in this case , it likely wo n't include africa .
that is a shame , say experts , because when it came to corruption , civil war or lack of political leadership , the former president said what he thought – even if he was addressing african heads of state at the african union 's assembly .
at the same time , he did not ignore the many positive signs on the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler dances with ghanian president john agyekum kufuor in 2007 " civil society is growing across africa .

whether it was praise or criticism – horst koehler 's main priority was to establish a dialogue of equals between africans and germans .
in his first speech to parliament in july 2004 , koehler made it clear that africa was a priority for him .

koehler had been at the helm of the international monetary fund until he was elected president .
the fund is notorious in africa for koehler 's structural adjustment policies , cost-cutting measures aimed at reducing public debts .
the imf forced various african countries to introduce school fees or make visits to the hospital more expensive as part of structural adjustment .
but koehler soon managed to change his perception in africa through his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited a youth center in rwanda in 2008 “ he gained a lot of popularity in africa when he started his ' partnership with africa ' initiative , " said engel .
partnership with africa was koehler 's pet project .
it was his attempt to make a direct contribution to the establishment of a dialogue of equals in real life .

the accusations are in connection with the hiring of a priest alleged to have been a sex offender in the 1980s . german prosecutors announced on wednesday that they were investigating claims that the head of the german bishops ' conference , robert zollitsch , aided and abetted a known sex offender in the church .
prosecutors said that they had received information indicating that , while zollitsch was in charge of the personnel department of a diocese in southern germany in 1987 , he appointed a priest who was known to have abused children .
the archdiocese of freiburg has released a statement denying that zollitsch was responsible for the appointment .
aiding and abetting prosecutors confirmed that they had launched an investigation , following reports by public broadcaster ard and the suedkurier newspaper .
the freiburg archdiocese has described the media reports as " absolutely weak " and " sensationalist . "
in 1987 zollitsch was head of the human resources department of the diocese of freiburg .
he is accused of rehiring a priest accused of sexually abusing children in a monestary in the 1960s .
the diocese says that the appointment was entirely in the hands of the monastery 's abbot , and that zollitsch neither knew of the original allegations nor the subsequent re-appointment .
part of a wider scandal sexual abuse scandals have rocked the church in germany since january , when dozens of cases emerged involving allegations of the sexual molestation of minors by priests and other clergy over a period of 50 years at catholic schools .
as head of the bishops ' conference , zollitsch has been at the forefront of the catholic church 's response to the ongoing reports of abuse .
he has often stated that the church needs to reform and " heal the wounds of victims . "
in his easter messages to his freiburg parishoners , he said the catholic church must examine its " dark aspects as well as our own shadowy sides .

the defense ministry is expected to tighten its belt , which could lead to a reduction of bundeswehr troops . cutting troop numbers in the german bundeswehr is one option under consideration as the german government prepares to meet on sunday and monday to come up with ways to plug large gaps in its deficit-laden budget .
german military spending is one area where significant savings could be made and according to media reports , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is considering several money-saving measures .
one consideration would be a reduction in the number of bundeswehr soldiers by nearly half .
according to the suttgarter zeitung and the hamburger abendblatt newspapers , one possibility would be to cut the number of troops from around 250,000 to 150,000 .

it would represent a large chunk of the 1 billion euros the defense ministry hopes to cut from its 31-billion-euro budget .
a law has already been introduced in the german parliament that would reduce the length of military service from nine to six months .

turkey has attempted to play mediator in middle east , but that was before an israeli military attack on a turkish aid ship .
ankara is playing with fire , says baha guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . the whole world knows that israel is not squeamish about enforcing its interests .
and in light of the latest attacks on gaza , it is a fact that israel will not hesitate violating human rights under the pretext of self-defense and attacking people with brute military force without regard for civilian casualties .
the question must be asked : what was the purpose of the actions of this independent turkish aid organization ?
the officially stated goals were not achieved ; the flotilla could neither break the israeli naval blockade nor bring relief supplies directly to gaza .
for weeks , israel had communicated to turkey through all available diplomatic channels that such aid action would , if necessary , be stopped with violence .
israel made good on its threats and boarded the largest ship of the maritime aid convoy , contravening international maritime law .
in the process there was a shoot-out : at least nine people died and dozens more were injured .
and now , the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan rages unchecked against israel and is playing a dangerous game .
turkey has been a nato member for almost 60 years .
as an ally in the western defense alliance , turkey has a peace obligation .
recent turkish diplomacy has succeeded in smoothing the tensions between iran and the west and mediating between syria and israel while remaining credible in the process .
but with this week 's incident , turkey has reduced itself to just another member of the anti-israel front in the middle east .
at the very least , turkey 's credibility regarding future mediation is put in doubt .
the turkish ship was decorated with giant turkish and palestinian flags .
the image of the incident was that israeli soldiers captured a turkish ship .
in turkey , tens of thousands of demonstrators were mobilized and laid siege to israel 's diplomatic missions .
prime minister erdogan raged on against israel , speaking of " state terrorism , " a " regime of lies " and arguing that israel must now be " punished . "
according to erdogan , whoever chooses to ignore the atrocities of israel makes himself " complicit in the crime against humanity . "
the arduous international efforts to achieve a lasting peace in the middle east are important to turkey , as is the peace process in the caucasus or the balkans .
therefore , they should not be harnessed to the cart of discordant states in the middle east that lack basic democratic structures . there are very few , barely audible voices in turkey that warn against a further verbal escalation .
in europe , the erdogan 's arguments fall on stunned ears .
although he condemns anti-semitism and promises the jewish community in his country security , the waves of anti-israeli hatred have reached turkey .
one of the few sensible voices in europe came from ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign committee of the german bundestag .
he called , contrary to the stance of germany 's christian democrats , for attempts to further motivate turkey towards eu membership rather than to reject it on religious and cultural grounds . it 's easy to see which camp turkey will fall into if its bid for eu membership fails . the eu would be acting in their own foreign policy interests by keeping turkey on the membership track .

the ban " concerns securities that registered on a regulated german market , " a finance ministry said .
the ban also encompasses certain trades on currencies that are not used for hedging purposes .
a previous version of the draft law had envisaged a complete ban on short selling currency derivates .
naked short is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
but unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy them back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether .
it is viewed as a far riskier form of trading .
the practice came under fire after greece struggled to raise capital to finance its debt .
naked trades were blamed for artificially inflating the country 's funding costs .
last month , germany stunned its international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide with its plan to temporarily ban naked short selling of some financial shares , sovereign debt bonds and credit default swaps .
after berlin announced its ban last month , christoph schmidt , head of germany 's rwi economics institute , referred to the move as " an isolated step in a globalized world " and doubted it would have an impact .
indeed , most short selling takes place in london ; it is not a common practice in germany .
the draft bill must still be approved by the lower house of german parliament , the bundestag , where chancellor merkel 's coalition government holds a majority .
the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , can delay the bill but not block it indefinitely .
the merkel camp recently lost its majority in the bundesrat. jb / afp / dpa editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the accusations are in connection with the hiring of a priest alleged to have been a sex offender in the 1980s . german prosecutors announced on wednesday that they were investigating claims that the head of the german bishops ' conference , robert zollitsch , aided and abetted a known sex offender in the church .
prosecutors said that they had received information indicating that , while zollitsch was in charge of the personnel department of a diocese in southern germany in 1987 , he appointed a priest who was known to have abused children .
the archdiocese of freiburg has released a statement denying that zollitsch was responsible for the appointment .
aiding and abetting prosecutors confirmed that they had launched an investigation , following reports by public broadcaster ard and the suedkurier newspaper .
the freiburg archdiocese has described the media reports as " absolutely weak " and " sensationalist . "
in 1987 zollitsch was head of the human resources department of the diocese of freiburg .
he is accused of rehiring a priest accused of sexually abusing children in a monestary in the 1960s .
the diocese says that the appointment was entirely in the hands of the monastery 's abbot , and that zollitsch neither knew of the original allegations nor the subsequent re-appointment .
part of a wider scandal sexual abuse scandals have rocked the church in germany since january , when dozens of cases emerged involving allegations of the sexual molestation of minors by priests and other clergy over a period of 50 years at catholic schools .
as head of the bishops ' conference , zollitsch has been at the forefront of the catholic church 's response to the ongoing reports of abuse .
he has often stated that the church needs to reform and " heal the wounds of victims . "
in his easter messages to his freiburg parishoners , he said the catholic church must examine its " dark aspects as well as our own shadowy sides .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 02.06.2010 turkey and us face tough decisions on relations after israeli flotilla raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as turkey 's relations with israel dive , ankara looks to the us while its relations with israel continue to plummet to new depths in the wake of the gaza flotilla raid , turkey is considering how to handle the us as washington tries to balance its ties with jerusalem and ankara . few countries are more enraged by israel 's raid on the gaza aid flotilla than turkey .
much of the action during monday 's pre-dawn raid by israeli commandos was focused on a turkish-flagged ship and at least four of the nine fatalities arising from the attack were pro-palestinian turks . in the days following , relations between turkey and israel have been strained to breaking point with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan calling the raid a " bloody massacre " and accusing israel of " unacceptable lawlessness . " erdogan has even gone so far as to refer to israel - a close partner since diplomatic ties with the jewish state were established in 1949 - as " a festering boil in the middle east that spreads hate and enmity , dynamites regional peace and spreads instability . " in such a situation , it is unsurprising that relations between turkey and israel are currently plummeting to an all-time low , even lower than when the relationship soured over israel 's military operations in gaza in 2008 .
but experts are also watching closely how relations between turkey and israel 's most powerful ally – the united states – will develop as the shockwaves from the flotilla raid ripple on . a furious erdogan wasted no time calling us president barack obama after the incident . " israel is faced with the danger of losing its sole friend in the region and the greatest contributor so far to regional peace , " erdogan told the us president in a one-hour telephone conversation , according to a turkish government statement on wednesday . bildunterschrift : erdogan suggested that turkey could abandon israel but trade and military ties remain too strong turkey-israel ties ' too strong to break ' turkey has been israel 's chief regional ally since a military cooperation deal was signed between the two countries in 1996 .
however , some sections of the us media claim the implication behind erdogan 's statement is that turkey , with its mainly muslim population , could shift its allegiance towards its new-found friends in the arab world , partners which the islamist-rooted government in ankara have been courting for some time . joost lagendijk , a senior advisor at the istanbul policy center , disagrees .
he believes that the connections between turkey and israel are too strong to be severed . " while we will see the two sides divided at an official , political level , turkey and israel will still have strong military and business ties , " he told deutsche welle . " it makes good sense to have good relations with the arabs but rejecting israel for the arabs is not a viable alternative . " while relations – especially those concerning trade – have been improving over the past few years with a host of arab nations , including syria , iran , lebanon and jordan , turkey still has its eyes set on europe and eu membership .
the european union is still the main power that turkey trusts most in the international arena , despite the eu 's continued ambivalence towards ankara 's accession hopes . however , some observers claim that the israeli raid offers turkey an opportunity to dangle the possibility of an eastward shift in the face of the united states to gain some leverage in a number of issues .
joost lagendijk believes it would be foolish to do so . " turkey 's standing in the middle east and its dealing with its arab partners are only possible because it has such good connections with both the us and the eu , ” he said .
“ that 's what makes turkey such an interesting partner to the arabs .
what would the value of turkey be without that ? " steven cook , a middle east expert at the council on foreign relations , believes turkey will pursue its own goals in the middle east and wo n't feel the need to pressure the us into supporting it . " turkey has economic , political and strategic interests in the arab middle east and turkish leaders obviously feel less inhibited to pursue their own interests in the region , regardless of washington 's wishes , " he told deutsche welle .
" the turks are willing to bend the regional rules of the game to serve ankara 's own interests .
if the resulting policies serve us goals at the same time , all well and good .
if not , so be it . " the united states may be closely watching turkey 's growing connection to regional arab powers but is unlikely to feel any threat from its closer ties with the likes of iran and syria .
despite its ambitions , turkey 's current economic and strategic power is still not enough to project discernible influence in the middle east and it still requires good relations with the us and eu to add weight to its status in the region . us looking to keep muslim ally turkey on side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain good relations with turkey bilateral relations by their nature have mutual benefits and turkey is n't the only partner seeking support .
the united states sees turkey as a key muslim ally and the obama administration has been working hard to repair the damage to relations caused by the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion . since then , the us and turkey have set-up intelligence sharing networks in the on-going fight against international terrorism while turkey hosts the us military infrastructure needed for its missions in neighbouring iraq and afghanistan . " turkey is still a key muslim ally to the us and is a favorite partner , one which is held up as an example of a predominantly islamic country with a growing democracy , " joost lagendijk said .
" the us wo n't want to jeapordise that .
if it turns on turkey for any reason , then the whole rhetoric washington has created about reforming the islamic world will crumble . " despite this , steven cook says , the two nations are increasingly finding themselves at odds with each other . " washington and ankara do share the same goals : peace between israel and the palestinians ; a stable , unified iraq ; an iran without nuclear weapons ; stability in afghanistan ; and a western-oriented syria , " he said . " when you get down to details , however , washington and ankara are on the opposite ends of virtually all these issues . " but after six decades of strategic cooperation , the stark reality is that while turkey and the united states are not enemies in the middle east , they are fast becoming strategic competitors . " turkey is asserting itself more in the middle east , where it has gone from a tepid observer to an influential player in eight short years , " cook added . washington faces balancing act with ankara , jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ties with israel will impact on its relations with turkey while turkey and the united states will not want to fall out , the situation arising from the israeli flotilla raid may still give turkey an opportunity to press its own agenda while maintaining strong ties with the us .
as pressure from the international community grows , turkey currently stands a greater chance at getting its own way over ending the blockade of gaza " the world has woken up to the gaza situation and now it is not only turkey calling for the end of the blockade , ” lagendijk said .
“ turkey , if it is clever , can use this to pressure the us which itself is growing more frustrated with the netanyahu government in israel .
maybe this will lead to the us calling for an end to the embargo . " author : nick amies editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 02.06.2010 german president 's resignation is a blow to the government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel probably never expected that koehler would cause a crisis for her the sudden resignation of the german president , horst koehler , is yet another challenge to a much-challenged government .
some analysts are saying the next days will be crucial for its future . in an editorial , the website of german public broadcaster zdf said " the fate of this -lsb- government -rsb- coalition will be decided in the next ten days . "
that 's a drastic view , but there 's no doubt that the resignation of the german president , horst koehler , on monday has delivered a major blow to the government .
it has many important issues to be dealing with : the crisis in the eurozone , the need for drastic savings , or the military involvement in afghanistan , to mention just a few .
and the government coalition , made up of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , has a few crises of its own : the poor showing of the two parties in the indecisive regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the sudden resignation of powerful regional leader roland koch in hessen , the internal backbiting within the liberal party , and disastrous opinion poll ratings .
so the chancellor , angela merkel , could well do without the scramble to find a convincing new president within 30 days , as required by the constitution .
is it a crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she regretted koehler 's departure and had tried to change his mind in a major interview on the evening of koehler 's resignation , she insisted , " we have to be sure not to make a crisis out of every challenge . "
but peter stuetzle , head of deutsche welle 's berlin office , thinks that a crisis is exactly what this is .
" this has been one too much for the government , " he says .
" there 's been a lot of trouble , and the government was just about to try to leave all that behind , and in this minute , koehler resigns . "
if the current government were doing well , the resignation would just be a nuisance , but it 's a sign of the government 's problems that the nuisance was immediately seen as a crisis .
all at sea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's coalition partners have already said they 'll leave the choice up to her wolfgang bosbach , a senior cdu backbencher , says that people do n't trust politicians of any party to solve the country 's problems , and so when respected figures like koehler or koch resign , the people feel that " the good people have left the ship , and we do n't how we will carry on in this rough sea . " what he , as a government supporter , fails to mention , is that , even if the people are disillusioned with all politicians , it 's his coalition which has the power to pilot the ship , and so that 's where the criticism hits particularly hard .
merkel has often been criticized for her lack of leadership - she tends to sit things out and wait until a consensus emerges - but the choice of a new president will require decisive action . peter stuetzle thinks the whole coalition has recognized the need .
her partners - not just the liberals , but also her bavarian sister-party , the csu - have agreed that they will do without their own candidates , and let her make the choice . " everything will be very fast , " he thinks , " and if it 's fast , and if it 's convincing too , then the government might even come out of the whole thing with a better public image at the end of the day . "

turkey has attempted to play mediator in middle east , but that was before an israeli military attack on a turkish aid ship .
ankara is playing with fire , says baha guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . the whole world knows that israel is not squeamish about enforcing its interests .
and in light of the latest attacks on gaza , it is a fact that israel will not hesitate violating human rights under the pretext of self-defense and attacking people with brute military force without regard for civilian casualties .
the question must be asked : what was the purpose of the actions of this independent turkish aid organization ?
the officially stated goals were not achieved ; the flotilla could neither break the israeli naval blockade nor bring relief supplies directly to gaza .
for weeks , israel had communicated to turkey through all available diplomatic channels that such aid action would , if necessary , be stopped with violence .
israel made good on its threats and boarded the largest ship of the maritime aid convoy , contravening international maritime law .
in the process there was a shoot-out : at least nine people died and dozens more were injured .
and now , the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan rages unchecked against israel and is playing a dangerous game .
turkey has been a nato member for almost 60 years .
as an ally in the western defense alliance , turkey has a peace obligation .
recent turkish diplomacy has succeeded in smoothing the tensions between iran and the west and mediating between syria and israel while remaining credible in the process .
but with this week 's incident , turkey has reduced itself to just another member of the anti-israel front in the middle east .
at the very least , turkey 's credibility regarding future mediation is put in doubt .
the turkish ship was decorated with giant turkish and palestinian flags .
the image of the incident was that israeli soldiers captured a turkish ship .
in turkey , tens of thousands of demonstrators were mobilized and laid siege to israel 's diplomatic missions .
prime minister erdogan raged on against israel , speaking of " state terrorism , " a " regime of lies " and arguing that israel must now be " punished . "
according to erdogan , whoever chooses to ignore the atrocities of israel makes himself " complicit in the crime against humanity . "
the arduous international efforts to achieve a lasting peace in the middle east are important to turkey , as is the peace process in the caucasus or the balkans .
therefore , they should not be harnessed to the cart of discordant states in the middle east that lack basic democratic structures . there are very few , barely audible voices in turkey that warn against a further verbal escalation .
in europe , the erdogan 's arguments fall on stunned ears .
although he condemns anti-semitism and promises the jewish community in his country security , the waves of anti-israeli hatred have reached turkey .
one of the few sensible voices in europe came from ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign committee of the german bundestag .
he called , contrary to the stance of germany 's christian democrats , for attempts to further motivate turkey towards eu membership rather than to reject it on religious and cultural grounds . it 's easy to see which camp turkey will fall into if its bid for eu membership fails . the eu would be acting in their own foreign policy interests by keeping turkey on the membership track .

although polish and russian investigators have not made any final conclusions , transcripts of the black-box cockpit recorders seem to support the theory that pilot error and poor conditions led to the crash .
the plane carrying kacynski and 95 other people , among them high-ranking government officials , crashed as it came in for a landing at smolensk airport in russia .
despite warnings from russian air traffic controllers - which can be heard on the black-box recordings - the pilots decided to attempt a landing anyway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's funeral followed a week after the crash " thank you , " said the chief pilot , arkadiusz protasiuk , on the recording , referring to the air traffic controller 's weather warning .
" if it 's possible , we 'll make an attempt , but if the weather is n't good we 'll go for a second pass . "
the pilots then began normal landing procedures .
about two minutes before the crash , alarms indicating " terrain ahead " with warnings to " pull up " repeatedly sounded in the cockpit .
these warnings went unheeded by the pilots until it was too late .
no indication of pressure from passengers in the polish media it had been speculated that pressure on the pilots to land , possibly from kaczynski himself , had contributed to the tragedy .
kaczynski and his delegation were running late for a planned ceremony in the katyn forest that marked the murder of 22,000 poles 70 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski and his wife both died in the crash however , the cockpit recordings provided no evidence to support this theory .
the voice of mariusz kazana , head of poland 's diplomatic protocol , can be heard telling the pilots " well , then we have a problem " if the plane were unable to land on the first try .
kazana can also be heard saying that there had been " no decision from the president on what to do . "
the pilots seemed to think that their landing attempt would not be possible due to the weather and that they would have to pull up for another pass or land at a different airport .
the last bit of audio recorded on the black box is the sound of the plane hitting a tree and an unidentified person in the cockpit cursing in polish .

the accusations are in connection with the hiring of a priest alleged to have been a sex offender in the 1980s . german prosecutors announced on wednesday that they were investigating claims that the head of the german bishops ' conference , robert zollitsch , aided and abetted a known sex offender in the church .
prosecutors said that they had received information indicating that , while zollitsch was in charge of the personnel department of a diocese in southern germany in 1987 , he appointed a priest who was known to have abused children .
the archdiocese of freiburg has released a statement denying that zollitsch was responsible for the appointment .
aiding and abetting prosecutors confirmed that they had launched an investigation , following reports by public broadcaster ard and the suedkurier newspaper .
the freiburg archdiocese has described the media reports as " absolutely weak " and " sensationalist . "
in 1987 zollitsch was head of the human resources department of the diocese of freiburg .
he is accused of rehiring a priest accused of sexually abusing children in a monestary in the 1960s .
the diocese says that the appointment was entirely in the hands of the monastery 's abbot , and that zollitsch neither knew of the original allegations nor the subsequent re-appointment .
part of a wider scandal sexual abuse scandals have rocked the church in germany since january , when dozens of cases emerged involving allegations of the sexual molestation of minors by priests and other clergy over a period of 50 years at catholic schools .
as head of the bishops ' conference , zollitsch has been at the forefront of the catholic church 's response to the ongoing reports of abuse .
he has often stated that the church needs to reform and " heal the wounds of victims . "
in his easter messages to his freiburg parishoners , he said the catholic church must examine its " dark aspects as well as our own shadowy sides .

his long career and definitive pronouncements have earned him the irreverent nickname " the pope of german letters . "
on june 2 , he turns 90 . marcel reich-ranicki was in charge of the literature section of the national newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in the 1970s , and hosted the television book discussion program " literary quartet " throughout the 1990 's .
these and many other public appearances where he freely made his pronouncements on german books and writing have made him one of germany 's best-known cultural critics .
reich-ranicki , who is celebrating his 90th birthday on june 2 , is also one of just a handful of jewish public figures in germany to resettle in the country after having survived world war ii .
born in 1920 in wloclawek , poland , the future critic attended high school in berlin .

risky career move " when i came to germany in ' 58 , and i saw what people were writing about literature in the -lsb- newspapers here , -rsb- i told my wife : i want to do an experiment , " reich-ranicki said in an acceptance speech after receiving the north rhine-westphalia state prize in 2005 .
" these people write so confusingly , so cryptically , i just do n't like their criticism , " he continued .
" i will say loud and clear what i think about books .
it is risky , and two things could happen : i will either rise to the top of the literary criticism hierarchy , or sink to the very bottom .
but i have to try . "
reich-ranicki has remained incorruptible and sharp in his opinions , and he does n't mince words .
that attitude has cost him a few friends over the years .
his dedication to speaking the truth as he sees it was behind a major uproar in 2008 , when he was invited to receive an honorary german television prize for his cultural contributions .
as recipients awaiting awards usually do , he sat passively in the audience as one tv personality after another came up to make a speech , accept an award , or tell a few jokes .
critic who speaks his mind he was definitely not impressed with what he saw - and he made no secret of his feelings .
when the time came for him to accept his honorary award , he stunned viewers by rejecting it .

" i did n't know what to expect here , and i think it is awful that i had to sit through this for so many hours . "
at first , some of the guests at the ceremony thought reich-ranicki was joking .
but in this case he was simply telling it like he saw it - live and on the air .
by giving an open , radical critique of what he saw as the poor state of german television , reich-ranicki underlined his reputation as something of a crank , not to mention a " hard taskmaster " and a " a specialist in executions , " as different critics have put it .
reich-ranicki answers his detractors by saying that indeed , his first and foremost job is to be tough and critical .
years on ' literary quartet ' " being called an ' execution specialist ' is really nonsense , " reich-ranicki told broadcaster wdr in a 1986 interview .
" but i try to be clear in my criticism .
and the clarity of criticism , well , that is a question of politesse .
you have to be polite to the readers .
and that means being clear and explicit with your meaning , not hiding behind ambiguous or enigmatic phrases . "
his appearances as the head critic on television 's " literary quartet " between 1988 and 2001 brought reich-ranicki to the small screen some 77 times - automatically launching him to the top of germany 's lit-crit pop cultural heap .
despite his fame , however , he certainly is n't infallible .
and if he had a reputation for judging literature based more on his personal reading preferences than on serious criticism , well , that did n't stop his opinion from making and breaking many a literary career .

his long career and definitive pronouncements have earned him the irreverent nickname " the pope of german letters . "
on june 2 , he turns 90 . marcel reich-ranicki was in charge of the literature section of the national newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in the 1970s , and hosted the television book discussion program " literary quartet " throughout the 1990 's .
these and many other public appearances where he freely made his pronouncements on german books and writing have made him one of germany 's best-known cultural critics .
reich-ranicki , who is celebrating his 90th birthday on june 2 , is also one of just a handful of jewish public figures in germany to resettle in the country after having survived world war ii .
born in 1920 in wloclawek , poland , the future critic attended high school in berlin .

turkey has attempted to play mediator in middle east , but that was before an israeli military attack on a turkish aid ship .
ankara is playing with fire , says baha guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . the whole world knows that israel is not squeamish about enforcing its interests .
and in light of the latest attacks on gaza , it is a fact that israel will not hesitate violating human rights under the pretext of self-defense and attacking people with brute military force without regard for civilian casualties .
the question must be asked : what was the purpose of the actions of this independent turkish aid organization ?
the officially stated goals were not achieved ; the flotilla could neither break the israeli naval blockade nor bring relief supplies directly to gaza .
for weeks , israel had communicated to turkey through all available diplomatic channels that such aid action would , if necessary , be stopped with violence .
israel made good on its threats and boarded the largest ship of the maritime aid convoy , contravening international maritime law .
in the process there was a shoot-out : at least nine people died and dozens more were injured .
and now , the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan rages unchecked against israel and is playing a dangerous game .
turkey has been a nato member for almost 60 years .
as an ally in the western defense alliance , turkey has a peace obligation .
recent turkish diplomacy has succeeded in smoothing the tensions between iran and the west and mediating between syria and israel while remaining credible in the process .
but with this week 's incident , turkey has reduced itself to just another member of the anti-israel front in the middle east .
at the very least , turkey 's credibility regarding future mediation is put in doubt .
the turkish ship was decorated with giant turkish and palestinian flags .
the image of the incident was that israeli soldiers captured a turkish ship .
in turkey , tens of thousands of demonstrators were mobilized and laid siege to israel 's diplomatic missions .
prime minister erdogan raged on against israel , speaking of " state terrorism , " a " regime of lies " and arguing that israel must now be " punished . "
according to erdogan , whoever chooses to ignore the atrocities of israel makes himself " complicit in the crime against humanity . "
the arduous international efforts to achieve a lasting peace in the middle east are important to turkey , as is the peace process in the caucasus or the balkans .
therefore , they should not be harnessed to the cart of discordant states in the middle east that lack basic democratic structures . there are very few , barely audible voices in turkey that warn against a further verbal escalation .
in europe , the erdogan 's arguments fall on stunned ears .
although he condemns anti-semitism and promises the jewish community in his country security , the waves of anti-israeli hatred have reached turkey .
one of the few sensible voices in europe came from ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign committee of the german bundestag .
he called , contrary to the stance of germany 's christian democrats , for attempts to further motivate turkey towards eu membership rather than to reject it on religious and cultural grounds . it 's easy to see which camp turkey will fall into if its bid for eu membership fails . the eu would be acting in their own foreign policy interests by keeping turkey on the membership track .

however , his surprise resignation may jeopardize the success of his african projects . as the german president , horst koehler travelled the world .
on state visits , people saw a president that was interested in different cultures and societies .
but koehler was always fond of one continent in particular : africa .
he did not overlook africa 's ills and when he described them , he did not mince his words either .
but with koehler having left office , there is a looming danger that africa will fall back to the bottom of the political agenda in germany again .
new german presidents usually do not continue projects started by their predecessors , because they want to set their own political focus .
in this case , it likely wo n't include africa .
that is a shame , say experts , because when it came to corruption , civil war or lack of political leadership , the former president said what he thought – even if he was addressing african heads of state at the african union 's assembly .
at the same time , he did not ignore the many positive signs on the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler dances with ghanian president john agyekum kufuor in 2007 " civil society is growing across africa .
more and more people refuse to give in to their destinies .
farmers come together to buy fertilizer or to build wells .
civil society groups fight against corruption and put their governments to task .
women take the initiative to built schools or clinics for aids patients , ” koehler once said in a speech .
whether it was praise or criticism – horst koehler 's main priority was to establish a dialogue of equals between africans and germans .
in his first speech to parliament in july 2004 , koehler made it clear that africa was a priority for him .
" it is my conviction that the humanity of our world will be measured against the fate of africa , " koehler told members of germany 's lower house , the bundestag .
imf legacy troublesome at first but most african leaders did not start cheering at his words right away .
" there were many people in africa in the beginning that automatically identified horst koehler with the international monetary fund , " said ulf engel , a scholar in the africa department of the university of leipzig .
koehler had been at the helm of the international monetary fund until he was elected president .
the fund is notorious in africa for koehler 's structural adjustment policies , cost-cutting measures aimed at reducing public debts .
the imf forced various african countries to introduce school fees or make visits to the hospital more expensive as part of structural adjustment .
but koehler soon managed to change his perception in africa through his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited a youth center in rwanda in 2008 “ he gained a lot of popularity in africa when he started his ' partnership with africa ' initiative , " said engel .
partnership with africa was koehler 's pet project .
it was his attempt to make a direct contribution to the establishment of a dialogue of equals in real life .
it was n't just members of germany 's and africa 's political and business elite who discussed topics such as the difficult relationship between africa and europe or the challenges faced by africa 's youth .
promising young people known as " future leaders " from africa and germany also always sat at the table .
all words , no action ?
critics sometimes commented that the meetings were just another talking shop .
they liked to complain that africa did not need more words , but action .
but as the university of leipzig 's engel says , koehler was able to consistently make a clear statement about the policies regarding africa .
" some politicians were clearly uncomfortable when he took a firm stand on issues that he felt the west needed to change .
a reduction of subsidies for western products for instance , or the need to take africa seriously , " engel said .
germany 's constitution did not give koehler much room to put his political ideas into practice .
according to the law , the president has little political power .
instead , he had to use the power of words to influence german politics , and that power was n't always enough .
“ it 's tragic that he did not manage to make politicians in berlin listen to him , " said engel .

however , his surprise resignation may jeopardize the success of his african projects . as the german president , horst koehler travelled the world .
on state visits , people saw a president that was interested in different cultures and societies .
but koehler was always fond of one continent in particular : africa .

when asked whether she would be interested in the job , von der leyen avoided any concrete statements of intent but there 's little doubt she has the confidence to take over from horst koehler .
" we now need to find a good solution for the country under extreme time pressure , " she said .
" i think it 's very important that the president enjoys a high level of trust from the people . "
von der leyen started her political career rather late but quickly rose through the party ranks .
it was not until 1990 that she joined the conservative christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
she first studied economics and later medicine before going on to work as a doctor and in research .

she successfully fought for a modern , social familiy policy to give , for example , single mothers better career chances .
in 2009 , von der leyen became germany 's new labor minister after franz josef jung resigned .
her new post has seen her popularity undiminished as the german labor market seemed to withstand the expected downturn in the wake of the global economic crisis .
initial opinion polls suggest that von der leyen is the politician who can muster more popular support than any of the other possible successors to koehler .
40 percent of the population are in favor of a woman taking over the country 's most senior post , while 25 percent would like to see von der leyen herself take over .
the post of president is largely ceremonial in germany , and the incumbent usually abstains from commenting on party politics .
the president is however expected to act as a moral authority in wider national debates .

when asked whether she would be interested in the job , von der leyen avoided any concrete statements of intent but there 's little doubt she has the confidence to take over from horst koehler .
" we now need to find a good solution for the country under extreme time pressure , " she said .
" i think it 's very important that the president enjoys a high level of trust from the people . "
von der leyen started her political career rather late but quickly rose through the party ranks .
it was not until 1990 that she joined the conservative christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
she first studied economics and later medicine before going on to work as a doctor and in research .
she entered local politics in 1991 and less than two years later was elected into the state parliament of lower saxony , where became minister for social affairs .
in 2005 chancellor angela merkel took her to berlin to become family minister .
modernizing family policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen was the driving force behind providing better child care herself a mother of seven , von der leyen played a crucial role in the cdu winning over new voters by modernizing the party 's all too conservative family policy .
she successfully fought for a modern , social familiy policy to give , for example , single mothers better career chances .
in 2009 , von der leyen became germany 's new labor minister after franz josef jung resigned .
her new post has seen her popularity undiminished as the german labor market seemed to withstand the expected downturn in the wake of the global economic crisis .
initial opinion polls suggest that von der leyen is the politician who can muster more popular support than any of the other possible successors to koehler .
40 percent of the population are in favor of a woman taking over the country 's most senior post , while 25 percent would like to see von der leyen herself take over .
the post of president is largely ceremonial in germany , and the incumbent usually abstains from commenting on party politics .
the president is however expected to act as a moral authority in wider national debates .
popular and political backing born in 1958 , von der leyen hails from a family with a longstanding tradition in politics .
her father was former state premier of lower saxony ernst albrecht , who also worked in brussels for the eu 's predecessor , the european community .
von der leyen spent the first few years of her life in belgium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christian democrat would be germany 's first woman president her husband is a professor of medicine heiko von der leyen .
he counts among his ancestors a number of prince electors , who for centuries determined the succession of german emperors .

the new guidelines provide stricter transparency guidelines , and place cra regulation under the authority of the european securities and markets authority -lrb- esma -rrb- , which the commission established last year and is due to come into force at the start of 2011 .
the esma would have the authority to impose sanctions on agencies , and even withdraw their licenses when they fail to comply with regulations .
the three main credit rating agencies , standard & poor 's , moody 's and fitch , had operated with significant latitude before the eu began issuing licenses and demanding a certain level of transparency just last year , according to karel lannoo , director of the european credit research institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lowered bond ratings have made it hard for greece to finance its budget " when the financial crisis started in 2007 , it was very clear that the ratings which the rating agencies gave were not based on pure objective facts , " he told deutsche welle .
" there were huge conflicts of interest .
that 's why the eu was then convinced that there should be a piece of regulation . "
case for regulation one function of rating agencies is to rate the risk of government bonds , using a scale of aaa for the most secure to d for an almost certain default .
the agencies then sell these ratings to investors and banks .
the conflict of interest appears when the agencies rate the very institutions that buy their services , said robert halver , stock analyst for baader bank .
" the rating agencies finance themselves very strongly with the sale of analytical instruments on pension funds , insurance agencies and banks , because everyone assumes that they have a lot of knowledge about country 's risks , " he told deutsche welle .
another reason for further regulation is the role cras have played in crises related to the public finance of budgets , most notably in greece but also in spain , portugal and italy , said lannoo .
when ratings agencies devalue government bonds , it creates a problem of " systemic stability . "
" all of a sudden these ratings agencies have drastically downgraded the debt of these countries , which as given rise to systemic effects , in the sense that many investors have started to sell the securities or the bonds of these countries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker has proposed a new cra close to the european central bank more competition halver said one solution to europe 's problem with cras would be the creation of a european rating agency to compete with the " big three , " as long as it was n't under the supervision of a public entity like the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- or the european commission , as eurogroup president jean-claude juncker recently suggested .
" then there would be suspicion that they would exercise their influence and try to sugarcoat negative evaluations , " he said .
" that can not happen . "
lannoo said the big three already have a european component in fitch , whose main shareholder is european .
rather than constructing a new european rating agency , he said regulators should instead make it easier for already-existing agencies to be licensed as cras .
" what in fact we need to do is ... to lower the entry barriers into the sector , " he said .
" but what we in fact have done with this european regulation now is just the opposite - we have increased the entry thresholds because it 's extremely difficult to be in line with this piece of regulation . "

the new guidelines provide stricter transparency guidelines , and place cra regulation under the authority of the european securities and markets authority -lrb- esma -rrb- , which the commission established last year and is due to come into force at the start of 2011 .
the esma would have the authority to impose sanctions on agencies , and even withdraw their licenses when they fail to comply with regulations .
the three main credit rating agencies , standard & poor 's , moody 's and fitch , had operated with significant latitude before the eu began issuing licenses and demanding a certain level of transparency just last year , according to karel lannoo , director of the european credit research institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lowered bond ratings have made it hard for greece to finance its budget " when the financial crisis started in 2007 , it was very clear that the ratings which the rating agencies gave were not based on pure objective facts , " he told deutsche welle .
" there were huge conflicts of interest .
that 's why the eu was then convinced that there should be a piece of regulation . "
case for regulation one function of rating agencies is to rate the risk of government bonds , using a scale of aaa for the most secure to d for an almost certain default .
the agencies then sell these ratings to investors and banks .
the conflict of interest appears when the agencies rate the very institutions that buy their services , said robert halver , stock analyst for baader bank .
" the rating agencies finance themselves very strongly with the sale of analytical instruments on pension funds , insurance agencies and banks , because everyone assumes that they have a lot of knowledge about country 's risks , " he told deutsche welle .
another reason for further regulation is the role cras have played in crises related to the public finance of budgets , most notably in greece but also in spain , portugal and italy , said lannoo .
when ratings agencies devalue government bonds , it creates a problem of " systemic stability . "
" all of a sudden these ratings agencies have drastically downgraded the debt of these countries , which as given rise to systemic effects , in the sense that many investors have started to sell the securities or the bonds of these countries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker has proposed a new cra close to the european central bank more competition halver said one solution to europe 's problem with cras would be the creation of a european rating agency to compete with the " big three , " as long as it was n't under the supervision of a public entity like the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- or the european commission , as eurogroup president jean-claude juncker recently suggested .
" then there would be suspicion that they would exercise their influence and try to sugarcoat negative evaluations , " he said .
" that can not happen . "
lannoo said the big three already have a european component in fitch , whose main shareholder is european .
rather than constructing a new european rating agency , he said regulators should instead make it easier for already-existing agencies to be licensed as cras .
" what in fact we need to do is ... to lower the entry barriers into the sector , " he said .
" but what we in fact have done with this european regulation now is just the opposite - we have increased the entry thresholds because it 's extremely difficult to be in line with this piece of regulation . "

some analysts are saying the next days will be crucial for its future . in an editorial , the website of german public broadcaster zdf said " the fate of this -lsb- government -rsb- coalition will be decided in the next ten days . "
that 's a drastic view , but there 's no doubt that the resignation of the german president , horst koehler , on monday has delivered a major blow to the government .
it has many important issues to be dealing with : the crisis in the eurozone , the need for drastic savings , or the military involvement in afghanistan , to mention just a few .
and the government coalition , made up of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , has a few crises of its own : the poor showing of the two parties in the indecisive regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the sudden resignation of powerful regional leader roland koch in hessen , the internal backbiting within the liberal party , and disastrous opinion poll ratings .
so the chancellor , angela merkel , could well do without the scramble to find a convincing new president within 30 days , as required by the constitution .
is it a crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she regretted koehler 's departure and had tried to change his mind in a major interview on the evening of koehler 's resignation , she insisted , " we have to be sure not to make a crisis out of every challenge . "
but peter stuetzle , head of deutsche welle 's berlin office , thinks that a crisis is exactly what this is .
" this has been one too much for the government , " he says .
" there 's been a lot of trouble , and the government was just about to try to leave all that behind , and in this minute , koehler resigns . "
if the current government were doing well , the resignation would just be a nuisance , but it 's a sign of the government 's problems that the nuisance was immediately seen as a crisis .
all at sea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's coalition partners have already said they 'll leave the choice up to her wolfgang bosbach , a senior cdu backbencher , says that people do n't trust politicians of any party to solve the country 's problems , and so when respected figures like koehler or koch resign , the people feel that " the good people have left the ship , and we do n't how we will carry on in this rough sea . " what he , as a government supporter , fails to mention , is that , even if the people are disillusioned with all politicians , it 's his coalition which has the power to pilot the ship , and so that 's where the criticism hits particularly hard .
merkel has often been criticized for her lack of leadership - she tends to sit things out and wait until a consensus emerges - but the choice of a new president will require decisive action . peter stuetzle thinks the whole coalition has recognized the need .
her partners - not just the liberals , but also her bavarian sister-party , the csu - have agreed that they will do without their own candidates , and let her make the choice . " everything will be very fast , " he thinks , " and if it 's fast , and if it 's convincing too , then the government might even come out of the whole thing with a better public image at the end of the day .

" what he , as a government supporter , fails to mention , is that , even if the people are disillusioned with all politicians , it 's his coalition which has the power to pilot the ship , and so that 's where the criticism hits particularly hard .
merkel has often been criticized for her lack of leadership - she tends to sit things out and wait until a consensus emerges - but the choice of a new president will require decisive action . peter stuetzle thinks the whole coalition has recognized the need .
her partners - not just the liberals , but also her bavarian sister-party , the csu - have agreed that they will do without their own candidates , and let her make the choice . " everything will be very fast , " he thinks , " and if it 's fast , and if it 's convincing too , then the government might even come out of the whole thing with a better public image at the end of the day .

swedish foreign minister carl bildt was among the european leaders in sarajevo lending his support to some balkan nations bidding to join the eu .
" there are a number of countries where enthusiasm for enlargement is less than 100 percent these days .
then it is important that we come here to reaffirm and say ... the door is open , " bildt said .
of the nations that emerged from the violent collapse of yugoslavia in the 1990s , slovenia has already joined the eu , croatia is close to membership and serbia , montenegro and macedonia have applied .
to the south , albania has also applied .
bosnia , which remains an international protectorate divided along ethnic lines , and kosovo , whose independence serbia and some eu states do not recognise , are lagging behind .
balkans welcome in light of the ongoing debt crisis in europe , there was some concern in the balkans that progress would be bogged down on absorbing new nations into the block .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign affairs chief catherine ashton with bosnia -lrb- r -rrb- and spain -lrb- l -rrb- foreign ministers at the meeting but bildt added that he expected " strong reaffirmation by the eu " encouraging the balkan nations to push on with their efforts to join the eu .
spain , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency and organized the meeting , added that balkan countries were welcome in the eu " a very good future for the whole region , a european future , and a commitment of the international community to support all western balkans to join the eu , that is the main message today , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos .
however , many balkan states will be hoping more than rhetoric comes out of the meeting .
this could come in the form of extending the right to travel without visas in the eu 's schengen zone to bosnia and albania , an idea put forth in brussels last week .
this right has already been given to serbia , montenegro and macedonia .
conference downgraded the sarajevo conference was originally planned as a summit , but reconfigured as informal talks because of the current row between serbia and its former province kosovo .
belgrade refuses to acknowledge kosovo , which declared independence from serbia in 2008 , and serbian officials insist they will not formally share any table with their kosovo counterparts . because the conference has revised its format , it will now not issue any formal declaration at the end of proceedings. mz / cb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.06.2010 opinion : turkey is playing a dangerous game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has called for israel to be punished .
turkey has attempted to play mediator in middle east , but that was before an israeli military attack on a turkish aid ship .
ankara is playing with fire , says baha guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . the whole world knows that israel is not squeamish about enforcing its interests .
and in light of the latest attacks on gaza , it is a fact that israel will not hesitate violating human rights under the pretext of self-defense and attacking people with brute military force without regard for civilian casualties .
the question must be asked : what was the purpose of the actions of this independent turkish aid organization ?
the officially stated goals were not achieved ; the flotilla could neither break the israeli naval blockade nor bring relief supplies directly to gaza .
for weeks , israel had communicated to turkey through all available diplomatic channels that such aid action would , if necessary , be stopped with violence .
israel made good on its threats and boarded the largest ship of the maritime aid convoy , contravening international maritime law .
in the process there was a shoot-out : at least nine people died and dozens more were injured .
and now , the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan rages unchecked against israel and is playing a dangerous game .
turkey has been a nato member for almost 60 years .
as an ally in the western defense alliance , turkey has a peace obligation .
recent turkish diplomacy has succeeded in smoothing the tensions between iran and the west and mediating between syria and israel while remaining credible in the process .
but with this week 's incident , turkey has reduced itself to just another member of the anti-israel front in the middle east .
at the very least , turkey 's credibility regarding future mediation is put in doubt .
the turkish ship was decorated with giant turkish and palestinian flags .
the image of the incident was that israeli soldiers captured a turkish ship .
in turkey , tens of thousands of demonstrators were mobilized and laid siege to israel 's diplomatic missions .
prime minister erdogan raged on against israel , speaking of " state terrorism , " a " regime of lies " and arguing that israel must now be " punished . "
according to erdogan , whoever chooses to ignore the atrocities of israel makes himself " complicit in the crime against humanity . "
the arduous international efforts to achieve a lasting peace in the middle east are important to turkey , as is the peace process in the caucasus or the balkans .
therefore , they should not be harnessed to the cart of discordant states in the middle east that lack basic democratic structures . there are very few , barely audible voices in turkey that warn against a further verbal escalation .
in europe , the erdogan 's arguments fall on stunned ears .
although he condemns anti-semitism and promises the jewish community in his country security , the waves of anti-israeli hatred have reached turkey .
one of the few sensible voices in europe came from ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign committee of the german bundestag .
he called , contrary to the stance of germany 's christian democrats , for attempts to further motivate turkey towards eu membership rather than to reject it on religious and cultural grounds . it 's easy to see which camp turkey will fall into if its bid for eu membership fails . the eu would be acting in their own foreign policy interests by keeping turkey on the membership track .

the cinema was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago . marcus vetter made a film in jenin three years ago - and stayed on to build a cinema in which to show it .
his documentary film , " the heart of jenin , " is about ahmed khatib , a palestinian boy killed by israeli troops while playing with a toy gun in the town 's refugee camp .
his parents decided to donate their son 's organs to save the lives of other children - arab and israeli .
the documentary won several awards , but it could n't be shown in jenin , where it all happened .
the town 's only movie theater was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago .
ahmed 's parents asked vetter to help renovate and reopen it , because they wanted to create more opportunities for local children .
he agreed , although he 'd never funded or managed a building project before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcus vetter with one of the palestinian teens who 's been helping on the project " you ca n't open such a place just by helping .
it 's impossible as i realized very fast .
this is real work .
what i could have helped with was fundraising , but raising money is nothing - raising money just means corruption , " said vetter .
vetter has run things in an unorthodox way .
he did n't apply for funding before starting .
he just began , with no salaries at all to pay the german architects and engineers .
they 're volunteers .
" just take a step , that 's what we did here , just renovate , do n't talk all the time , and do it with all your passion , " said vetter .
the project is ambitious .
vetter and his team are renovating the old indoor cinema , building an outdoor one , adding a cafe and guest house , as well as setting up a film production and distribution company .
government , private donors covered costs so far , the project has cost more than half a million euros .
most of the money has come from the german government , with the rest from corporate donors and ordinary people .
along the way , money has always been tight .
earlier this year , vetter simply ran out of cash .
he wrote to six donors saying he needed 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- to finish the job .
only one of them replied - legendary british musician roger waters , of pink floyd fame .
" having met all the people involved i felt connected to them and i felt it was the least i could do to give them the money to finish the project , " said waters , talking by phone from the united states .
waters says he was inspired to help by the generosity of ahmed khatib 's father .
" this project was fundamentally and always attached to that story , that incredibly moving story .
he gives the rest of us hope that we may at some point find a partial solution to the plight the palestinian people find themselves in , " said waters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck delivers all the technical equipment to the cinema dialogue with other cultures fakhri hamad , the project manager for cinema jenin , says the project is changing the town .

now it 's become a project of the town itself .
jenin has the chance to prove it 's ready to accept other cultures , to accept peace and to accept dialogue , " said hamad .
it 's been a huge turnaround for jenin , a town with a population of around 250,000 which became known as the source of a third of the suicide bombers of the palestinian uprising known as the second intifada .

earlier this year , palestinian intellectuals criticized cinema jenin , arguing that it " normalized " relations between palestinians and israel .
they said the project relied on cooperation with israel and that they opposed building a cinema while israel 's occupation army remained in the west bank .

" i did think then that the project might fail .

they want the town 's young people to have more of everything than their son had - more opportunities , more of a future , and of course more security .

the cinema was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago . marcus vetter made a film in jenin three years ago - and stayed on to build a cinema in which to show it .
his documentary film , " the heart of jenin , " is about ahmed khatib , a palestinian boy killed by israeli troops while playing with a toy gun in the town 's refugee camp .
his parents decided to donate their son 's organs to save the lives of other children - arab and israeli .
the documentary won several awards , but it could n't be shown in jenin , where it all happened .
the town 's only movie theater was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago .
ahmed 's parents asked vetter to help renovate and reopen it , because they wanted to create more opportunities for local children .
he agreed , although he 'd never funded or managed a building project before .

most of the money has come from the german government , with the rest from corporate donors and ordinary people .

his long career and definitive pronouncements have earned him the irreverent nickname " the pope of german letters . "
on june 2 , he turns 90 . marcel reich-ranicki was in charge of the literature section of the national newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in the 1970s , and hosted the television book discussion program " literary quartet " throughout the 1990 's .
these and many other public appearances where he freely made his pronouncements on german books and writing have made him one of germany 's best-known cultural critics .
reich-ranicki , who is celebrating his 90th birthday on june 2 , is also one of just a handful of jewish public figures in germany to resettle in the country after having survived world war ii .
born in 1920 in wloclawek , poland , the future critic attended high school in berlin .
because he was jewish , he was denied entry to the university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the critic , just ending his ninth decade , is still up for an argument after being deported to poland , reich-ranicki was able to flee the warsaw ghetto with his wife , tosia .
in 1958 , he returned to germany and dedicated himself to the study of german language and literature - and saw an opening for himself in the world of german letters .
risky career move " when i came to germany in ' 58 , and i saw what people were writing about literature in the -lsb- newspapers here , -rsb- i told my wife : i want to do an experiment , " reich-ranicki said in an acceptance speech after receiving the north rhine-westphalia state prize in 2005 .
" these people write so confusingly , so cryptically , i just do n't like their criticism , " he continued .
" i will say loud and clear what i think about books .
it is risky , and two things could happen : i will either rise to the top of the literary criticism hierarchy , or sink to the very bottom .
but i have to try . "
reich-ranicki has remained incorruptible and sharp in his opinions , and he does n't mince words .
that attitude has cost him a few friends over the years .
his dedication to speaking the truth as he sees it was behind a major uproar in 2008 , when he was invited to receive an honorary german television prize for his cultural contributions .
as recipients awaiting awards usually do , he sat passively in the audience as one tv personality after another came up to make a speech , accept an award , or tell a few jokes .
critic who speaks his mind he was definitely not impressed with what he saw - and he made no secret of his feelings .
when the time came for him to accept his honorary award , he stunned viewers by rejecting it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel awarded reich-ranicki the henri-nannen prize in 2008 " i can not accept this prize , " reich-ranicki told the shocked audience .
" i did n't know what to expect here , and i think it is awful that i had to sit through this for so many hours . "
at first , some of the guests at the ceremony thought reich-ranicki was joking .
but in this case he was simply telling it like he saw it - live and on the air .
by giving an open , radical critique of what he saw as the poor state of german television , reich-ranicki underlined his reputation as something of a crank , not to mention a " hard taskmaster " and a " a specialist in executions , " as different critics have put it .
reich-ranicki answers his detractors by saying that indeed , his first and foremost job is to be tough and critical .
years on ' literary quartet ' " being called an ' execution specialist ' is really nonsense , " reich-ranicki told broadcaster wdr in a 1986 interview .
" but i try to be clear in my criticism .
and the clarity of criticism , well , that is a question of politesse .
you have to be polite to the readers .
and that means being clear and explicit with your meaning , not hiding behind ambiguous or enigmatic phrases . "
his appearances as the head critic on television 's " literary quartet " between 1988 and 2001 brought reich-ranicki to the small screen some 77 times - automatically launching him to the top of germany 's lit-crit pop cultural heap .
despite his fame , however , he certainly is n't infallible .
and if he had a reputation for judging literature based more on his personal reading preferences than on serious criticism , well , that did n't stop his opinion from making and breaking many a literary career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his 2008 rejection of the german tv prize came as a shock those who raised his wrath - peter handke , guenter grass or martin walser , for example - had to fight their way into the market .
on the contrary , favorites such as spanish writer javier marias or berlin chronicler judith hermann more or less owe their success to reich-ranicki 's praises .
boring book ?
bad news the worst thing that reich-ranicki could say about a book was : " boring . "
his anti-academic , folksy and agreeably polemical ideas about literature can most likely be traced back to his own , sad biography .
as a persecuted jew he escaped the warsaw ghetto and various deportations , as though by a miracle .
at the time , a polish printer hid reich-ranicki and his wife from the nazis .
in payment , the literature lover regaled his benefactors with an endless slew of stories : shakespeare , goethe , schiller , etc .
telling stories to stay alive - the experience made a lasting impression on reich-ranicki , whose biggest successes came when he broke literary-criticism taboos .
years later , he wrote his own life story , and - unlike the biographies of many other critics - this one became a bestseller .

his long career and definitive pronouncements have earned him the irreverent nickname " the pope of german letters . "
on june 2 , he turns 90 . marcel reich-ranicki was in charge of the literature section of the national newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in the 1970s , and hosted the television book discussion program " literary quartet " throughout the 1990 's .
these and many other public appearances where he freely made his pronouncements on german books and writing have made him one of germany 's best-known cultural critics .
reich-ranicki , who is celebrating his 90th birthday on june 2 , is also one of just a handful of jewish public figures in germany to resettle in the country after having survived world war ii .
born in 1920 in wloclawek , poland , the future critic attended high school in berlin .
because he was jewish , he was denied entry to the university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the critic , just ending his ninth decade , is still up for an argument after being deported to poland , reich-ranicki was able to flee the warsaw ghetto with his wife , tosia .
in 1958 , he returned to germany and dedicated himself to the study of german language and literature - and saw an opening for himself in the world of german letters .
risky career move " when i came to germany in ' 58 , and i saw what people were writing about literature in the -lsb- newspapers here , -rsb- i told my wife : i want to do an experiment , " reich-ranicki said in an acceptance speech after receiving the north rhine-westphalia state prize in 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 02.06.2010 turkey and us face tough decisions on relations after israeli flotilla raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as turkey 's relations with israel dive , ankara looks to the us while its relations with israel continue to plummet to new depths in the wake of the gaza flotilla raid , turkey is considering how to handle the us as washington tries to balance its ties with jerusalem and ankara . few countries are more enraged by israel 's raid on the gaza aid flotilla than turkey .
much of the action during monday 's pre-dawn raid by israeli commandos was focused on a turkish-flagged ship and at least four of the nine fatalities arising from the attack were pro-palestinian turks . in the days following , relations between turkey and israel have been strained to breaking point with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan calling the raid a " bloody massacre " and accusing israel of " unacceptable lawlessness . " erdogan has even gone so far as to refer to israel - a close partner since diplomatic ties with the jewish state were established in 1949 - as " a festering boil in the middle east that spreads hate and enmity , dynamites regional peace and spreads instability . " in such a situation , it is unsurprising that relations between turkey and israel are currently plummeting to an all-time low , even lower than when the relationship soured over israel 's military operations in gaza in 2008 .
but experts are also watching closely how relations between turkey and israel 's most powerful ally – the united states – will develop as the shockwaves from the flotilla raid ripple on . a furious erdogan wasted no time calling us president barack obama after the incident . " israel is faced with the danger of losing its sole friend in the region and the greatest contributor so far to regional peace , " erdogan told the us president in a one-hour telephone conversation , according to a turkish government statement on wednesday . bildunterschrift : erdogan suggested that turkey could abandon israel but trade and military ties remain too strong turkey-israel ties ' too strong to break ' turkey has been israel 's chief regional ally since a military cooperation deal was signed between the two countries in 1996 .
however , some sections of the us media claim the implication behind erdogan 's statement is that turkey , with its mainly muslim population , could shift its allegiance towards its new-found friends in the arab world , partners which the islamist-rooted government in ankara have been courting for some time . joost lagendijk , a senior advisor at the istanbul policy center , disagrees .
he believes that the connections between turkey and israel are too strong to be severed . " while we will see the two sides divided at an official , political level , turkey and israel will still have strong military and business ties , " he told deutsche welle . " it makes good sense to have good relations with the arabs but rejecting israel for the arabs is not a viable alternative . " while relations – especially those concerning trade – have been improving over the past few years with a host of arab nations , including syria , iran , lebanon and jordan , turkey still has its eyes set on europe and eu membership .
the european union is still the main power that turkey trusts most in the international arena , despite the eu 's continued ambivalence towards ankara 's accession hopes . however , some observers claim that the israeli raid offers turkey an opportunity to dangle the possibility of an eastward shift in the face of the united states to gain some leverage in a number of issues .
joost lagendijk believes it would be foolish to do so . " turkey 's standing in the middle east and its dealing with its arab partners are only possible because it has such good connections with both the us and the eu , ” he said .
“ that 's what makes turkey such an interesting partner to the arabs .
what would the value of turkey be without that ? " steven cook , a middle east expert at the council on foreign relations , believes turkey will pursue its own goals in the middle east and wo n't feel the need to pressure the us into supporting it . " turkey has economic , political and strategic interests in the arab middle east and turkish leaders obviously feel less inhibited to pursue their own interests in the region , regardless of washington 's wishes , " he told deutsche welle .
" the turks are willing to bend the regional rules of the game to serve ankara 's own interests .
if the resulting policies serve us goals at the same time , all well and good .
if not , so be it . " the united states may be closely watching turkey 's growing connection to regional arab powers but is unlikely to feel any threat from its closer ties with the likes of iran and syria .
despite its ambitions , turkey 's current economic and strategic power is still not enough to project discernible influence in the middle east and it still requires good relations with the us and eu to add weight to its status in the region . us looking to keep muslim ally turkey on side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain good relations with turkey bilateral relations by their nature have mutual benefits and turkey is n't the only partner seeking support .
the united states sees turkey as a key muslim ally and the obama administration has been working hard to repair the damage to relations caused by the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion . since then , the us and turkey have set-up intelligence sharing networks in the on-going fight against international terrorism while turkey hosts the us military infrastructure needed for its missions in neighbouring iraq and afghanistan . " turkey is still a key muslim ally to the us and is a favorite partner , one which is held up as an example of a predominantly islamic country with a growing democracy , " joost lagendijk said .
" the us wo n't want to jeapordise that .
if it turns on turkey for any reason , then the whole rhetoric washington has created about reforming the islamic world will crumble . " despite this , steven cook says , the two nations are increasingly finding themselves at odds with each other .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 02.06.2010 turkey and us face tough decisions on relations after israeli flotilla raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as turkey 's relations with israel dive , ankara looks to the us while its relations with israel continue to plummet to new depths in the wake of the gaza flotilla raid , turkey is considering how to handle the us as washington tries to balance its ties with jerusalem and ankara . few countries are more enraged by israel 's raid on the gaza aid flotilla than turkey .
much of the action during monday 's pre-dawn raid by israeli commandos was focused on a turkish-flagged ship and at least four of the nine fatalities arising from the attack were pro-palestinian turks . in the days following , relations between turkey and israel have been strained to breaking point with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan calling the raid a " bloody massacre " and accusing israel of " unacceptable lawlessness . " erdogan has even gone so far as to refer to israel - a close partner since diplomatic ties with the jewish state were established in 1949 - as " a festering boil in the middle east that spreads hate and enmity , dynamites regional peace and spreads instability . " in such a situation , it is unsurprising that relations between turkey and israel are currently plummeting to an all-time low , even lower than when the relationship soured over israel 's military operations in gaza in 2008 .
but experts are also watching closely how relations between turkey and israel 's most powerful ally – the united states – will develop as the shockwaves from the flotilla raid ripple on . a furious erdogan wasted no time calling us president barack obama after the incident . " israel is faced with the danger of losing its sole friend in the region and the greatest contributor so far to regional peace , " erdogan told the us president in a one-hour telephone conversation , according to a turkish government statement on wednesday . bildunterschrift : erdogan suggested that turkey could abandon israel but trade and military ties remain too strong turkey-israel ties ' too strong to break ' turkey has been israel 's chief regional ally since a military cooperation deal was signed between the two countries in 1996 .
however , some sections of the us media claim the implication behind erdogan 's statement is that turkey , with its mainly muslim population , could shift its allegiance towards its new-found friends in the arab world , partners which the islamist-rooted government in ankara have been courting for some time . joost lagendijk , a senior advisor at the istanbul policy center , disagrees .
he believes that the connections between turkey and israel are too strong to be severed . " while we will see the two sides divided at an official , political level , turkey and israel will still have strong military and business ties , " he told deutsche welle . " it makes good sense to have good relations with the arabs but rejecting israel for the arabs is not a viable alternative . " while relations – especially those concerning trade – have been improving over the past few years with a host of arab nations , including syria , iran , lebanon and jordan , turkey still has its eyes set on europe and eu membership .
the european union is still the main power that turkey trusts most in the international arena , despite the eu 's continued ambivalence towards ankara 's accession hopes . however , some observers claim that the israeli raid offers turkey an opportunity to dangle the possibility of an eastward shift in the face of the united states to gain some leverage in a number of issues .
joost lagendijk believes it would be foolish to do so . " turkey 's standing in the middle east and its dealing with its arab partners are only possible because it has such good connections with both the us and the eu , ” he said .
“ that 's what makes turkey such an interesting partner to the arabs .
what would the value of turkey be without that ? " steven cook , a middle east expert at the council on foreign relations , believes turkey will pursue its own goals in the middle east and wo n't feel the need to pressure the us into supporting it . " turkey has economic , political and strategic interests in the arab middle east and turkish leaders obviously feel less inhibited to pursue their own interests in the region , regardless of washington 's wishes , " he told deutsche welle .
" the turks are willing to bend the regional rules of the game to serve ankara 's own interests .
if the resulting policies serve us goals at the same time , all well and good .
if not , so be it . " the united states may be closely watching turkey 's growing connection to regional arab powers but is unlikely to feel any threat from its closer ties with the likes of iran and syria .
despite its ambitions , turkey 's current economic and strategic power is still not enough to project discernible influence in the middle east and it still requires good relations with the us and eu to add weight to its status in the region . us looking to keep muslim ally turkey on side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain good relations with turkey bilateral relations by their nature have mutual benefits and turkey is n't the only partner seeking support .
the united states sees turkey as a key muslim ally and the obama administration has been working hard to repair the damage to relations caused by the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion . since then , the us and turkey have set-up intelligence sharing networks in the on-going fight against international terrorism while turkey hosts the us military infrastructure needed for its missions in neighbouring iraq and afghanistan . " turkey is still a key muslim ally to the us and is a favorite partner , one which is held up as an example of a predominantly islamic country with a growing democracy , " joost lagendijk said .
" the us wo n't want to jeapordise that .
if it turns on turkey for any reason , then the whole rhetoric washington has created about reforming the islamic world will crumble . " despite this , steven cook says , the two nations are increasingly finding themselves at odds with each other . " washington and ankara do share the same goals : peace between israel and the palestinians ; a stable , unified iraq ; an iran without nuclear weapons ; stability in afghanistan ; and a western-oriented syria , " he said . " when you get down to details , however , washington and ankara are on the opposite ends of virtually all these issues . " but after six decades of strategic cooperation , the stark reality is that while turkey and the united states are not enemies in the middle east , they are fast becoming strategic competitors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 02.06.2010 turkey and us face tough decisions on relations after israeli flotilla raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as turkey 's relations with israel dive , ankara looks to the us while its relations with israel continue to plummet to new depths in the wake of the gaza flotilla raid , turkey is considering how to handle the us as washington tries to balance its ties with jerusalem and ankara . few countries are more enraged by israel 's raid on the gaza aid flotilla than turkey .
much of the action during monday 's pre-dawn raid by israeli commandos was focused on a turkish-flagged ship and at least four of the nine fatalities arising from the attack were pro-palestinian turks . in the days following , relations between turkey and israel have been strained to breaking point with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan calling the raid a " bloody massacre " and accusing israel of " unacceptable lawlessness . " erdogan has even gone so far as to refer to israel - a close partner since diplomatic ties with the jewish state were established in 1949 - as " a festering boil in the middle east that spreads hate and enmity , dynamites regional peace and spreads instability . " in such a situation , it is unsurprising that relations between turkey and israel are currently plummeting to an all-time low , even lower than when the relationship soured over israel 's military operations in gaza in 2008 .
but experts are also watching closely how relations between turkey and israel 's most powerful ally – the united states – will develop as the shockwaves from the flotilla raid ripple on . a furious erdogan wasted no time calling us president barack obama after the incident . " israel is faced with the danger of losing its sole friend in the region and the greatest contributor so far to regional peace , " erdogan told the us president in a one-hour telephone conversation , according to a turkish government statement on wednesday . bildunterschrift : erdogan suggested that turkey could abandon israel but trade and military ties remain too strong turkey-israel ties ' too strong to break ' turkey has been israel 's chief regional ally since a military cooperation deal was signed between the two countries in 1996 .
however , some sections of the us media claim the implication behind erdogan 's statement is that turkey , with its mainly muslim population , could shift its allegiance towards its new-found friends in the arab world , partners which the islamist-rooted government in ankara have been courting for some time . joost lagendijk , a senior advisor at the istanbul policy center , disagrees .
he believes that the connections between turkey and israel are too strong to be severed . " while we will see the two sides divided at an official , political level , turkey and israel will still have strong military and business ties , " he told deutsche welle . " it makes good sense to have good relations with the arabs but rejecting israel for the arabs is not a viable alternative . " while relations – especially those concerning trade – have been improving over the past few years with a host of arab nations , including syria , iran , lebanon and jordan , turkey still has its eyes set on europe and eu membership .
the european union is still the main power that turkey trusts most in the international arena , despite the eu 's continued ambivalence towards ankara 's accession hopes . however , some observers claim that the israeli raid offers turkey an opportunity to dangle the possibility of an eastward shift in the face of the united states to gain some leverage in a number of issues .
joost lagendijk believes it would be foolish to do so . " turkey 's standing in the middle east and its dealing with its arab partners are only possible because it has such good connections with both the us and the eu , ” he said .
“ that 's what makes turkey such an interesting partner to the arabs .
what would the value of turkey be without that ? " steven cook , a middle east expert at the council on foreign relations , believes turkey will pursue its own goals in the middle east and wo n't feel the need to pressure the us into supporting it . " turkey has economic , political and strategic interests in the arab middle east and turkish leaders obviously feel less inhibited to pursue their own interests in the region , regardless of washington 's wishes , " he told deutsche welle .
" the turks are willing to bend the regional rules of the game to serve ankara 's own interests .
if the resulting policies serve us goals at the same time , all well and good .
if not , so be it . " the united states may be closely watching turkey 's growing connection to regional arab powers but is unlikely to feel any threat from its closer ties with the likes of iran and syria .
despite its ambitions , turkey 's current economic and strategic power is still not enough to project discernible influence in the middle east and it still requires good relations with the us and eu to add weight to its status in the region . us looking to keep muslim ally turkey on side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain good relations with turkey bilateral relations by their nature have mutual benefits and turkey is n't the only partner seeking support .
the united states sees turkey as a key muslim ally and the obama administration has been working hard to repair the damage to relations caused by the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion . since then , the us and turkey have set-up intelligence sharing networks in the on-going fight against international terrorism while turkey hosts the us military infrastructure needed for its missions in neighbouring iraq and afghanistan . " turkey is still a key muslim ally to the us and is a favorite partner , one which is held up as an example of a predominantly islamic country with a growing democracy , " joost lagendijk said .
" the us wo n't want to jeapordise that .
if it turns on turkey for any reason , then the whole rhetoric washington has created about reforming the islamic world will crumble . " despite this , steven cook says , the two nations are increasingly finding themselves at odds with each other . " washington and ankara do share the same goals : peace between israel and the palestinians ; a stable , unified iraq ; an iran without nuclear weapons ; stability in afghanistan ; and a western-oriented syria , " he said . " when you get down to details , however , washington and ankara are on the opposite ends of virtually all these issues . " but after six decades of strategic cooperation , the stark reality is that while turkey and the united states are not enemies in the middle east , they are fast becoming strategic competitors . " turkey is asserting itself more in the middle east , where it has gone from a tepid observer to an influential player in eight short years , " cook added . washington faces balancing act with ankara , jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ties with israel will impact on its relations with turkey while turkey and the united states will not want to fall out , the situation arising from the israeli flotilla raid may still give turkey an opportunity to press its own agenda while maintaining strong ties with the us .
as pressure from the international community grows , turkey currently stands a greater chance at getting its own way over ending the blockade of gaza " the world has woken up to the gaza situation and now it is not only turkey calling for the end of the blockade , ” lagendijk said .
“ turkey , if it is clever , can use this to pressure the us which itself is growing more frustrated with the netanyahu government in israel .

the ban " concerns securities that registered on a regulated german market , " a finance ministry said .
the ban also encompasses certain trades on currencies that are not used for hedging purposes .
a previous version of the draft law had envisaged a complete ban on short selling currency derivates .
naked short is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
but unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy them back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether .
it is viewed as a far riskier form of trading .
the practice came under fire after greece struggled to raise capital to finance its debt .
naked trades were blamed for artificially inflating the country 's funding costs .
last month , germany stunned its international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide with its plan to temporarily ban naked short selling of some financial shares , sovereign debt bonds and credit default swaps .
after berlin announced its ban last month , christoph schmidt , head of germany 's rwi economics institute , referred to the move as " an isolated step in a globalized world " and doubted it would have an impact .
indeed , most short selling takes place in london ; it is not a common practice in germany .
the draft bill must still be approved by the lower house of german parliament , the bundestag , where chancellor merkel 's coalition government holds a majority .

the defense ministry is expected to tighten its belt , which could lead to a reduction of bundeswehr troops . cutting troop numbers in the german bundeswehr is one option under consideration as the german government prepares to meet on sunday and monday to come up with ways to plug large gaps in its deficit-laden budget .
german military spending is one area where significant savings could be made and according to media reports , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is considering several money-saving measures .
one consideration would be a reduction in the number of bundeswehr soldiers by nearly half .
according to the suttgarter zeitung and the hamburger abendblatt newspapers , one possibility would be to cut the number of troops from around 250,000 to 150,000 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guttenberg is hoping to slash a billion euros from the defense budget another option would be eliminating germany 's mandatory military service .
the hamburger abendblatt wrote that this could result in savings of around 400 million euros -lrb- $ 489 million -rrb- .

swedish foreign minister carl bildt was among the european leaders in sarajevo lending his support to some balkan nations bidding to join the eu .
" there are a number of countries where enthusiasm for enlargement is less than 100 percent these days .
then it is important that we come here to reaffirm and say ... the door is open , " bildt said .
of the nations that emerged from the violent collapse of yugoslavia in the 1990s , slovenia has already joined the eu , croatia is close to membership and serbia , montenegro and macedonia have applied .
to the south , albania has also applied .
bosnia , which remains an international protectorate divided along ethnic lines , and kosovo , whose independence serbia and some eu states do not recognise , are lagging behind .
balkans welcome in light of the ongoing debt crisis in europe , there was some concern in the balkans that progress would be bogged down on absorbing new nations into the block .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign affairs chief catherine ashton with bosnia -lrb- r -rrb- and spain -lrb- l -rrb- foreign ministers at the meeting but bildt added that he expected " strong reaffirmation by the eu " encouraging the balkan nations to push on with their efforts to join the eu .
spain , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency and organized the meeting , added that balkan countries were welcome in the eu " a very good future for the whole region , a european future , and a commitment of the international community to support all western balkans to join the eu , that is the main message today , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos .
however , many balkan states will be hoping more than rhetoric comes out of the meeting .
this could come in the form of extending the right to travel without visas in the eu 's schengen zone to bosnia and albania , an idea put forth in brussels last week .
this right has already been given to serbia , montenegro and macedonia .
conference downgraded the sarajevo conference was originally planned as a summit , but reconfigured as informal talks because of the current row between serbia and its former province kosovo .
belgrade refuses to acknowledge kosovo , which declared independence from serbia in 2008 , and serbian officials insist they will not formally share any table with their kosovo counterparts . because the conference has revised its format , it will now not issue any formal declaration at the end of proceedings. mz / cb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some analysts are saying the next days will be crucial for its future . in an editorial , the website of german public broadcaster zdf said " the fate of this -lsb- government -rsb- coalition will be decided in the next ten days . "
that 's a drastic view , but there 's no doubt that the resignation of the german president , horst koehler , on monday has delivered a major blow to the government .
it has many important issues to be dealing with : the crisis in the eurozone , the need for drastic savings , or the military involvement in afghanistan , to mention just a few .
and the government coalition , made up of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , has a few crises of its own : the poor showing of the two parties in the indecisive regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the sudden resignation of powerful regional leader roland koch in hessen , the internal backbiting within the liberal party , and disastrous opinion poll ratings .
so the chancellor , angela merkel , could well do without the scramble to find a convincing new president within 30 days , as required by the constitution .
is it a crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she regretted koehler 's departure and had tried to change his mind in a major interview on the evening of koehler 's resignation , she insisted , " we have to be sure not to make a crisis out of every challenge . "
but peter stuetzle , head of deutsche welle 's berlin office , thinks that a crisis is exactly what this is .
" this has been one too much for the government , " he says .
" there 's been a lot of trouble , and the government was just about to try to leave all that behind , and in this minute , koehler resigns . "
if the current government were doing well , the resignation would just be a nuisance , but it 's a sign of the government 's problems that the nuisance was immediately seen as a crisis .

" what he , as a government supporter , fails to mention , is that , even if the people are disillusioned with all politicians , it 's his coalition which has the power to pilot the ship , and so that 's where the criticism hits particularly hard .
merkel has often been criticized for her lack of leadership - she tends to sit things out and wait until a consensus emerges - but the choice of a new president will require decisive action . peter stuetzle thinks the whole coalition has recognized the need .
her partners - not just the liberals , but also her bavarian sister-party , the csu - have agreed that they will do without their own candidates , and let her make the choice . " everything will be very fast , " he thinks , " and if it 's fast , and if it 's convincing too , then the government might even come out of the whole thing with a better public image at the end of the day .

his long career and definitive pronouncements have earned him the irreverent nickname " the pope of german letters . "
on june 2 , he turns 90 . marcel reich-ranicki was in charge of the literature section of the national newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in the 1970s , and hosted the television book discussion program " literary quartet " throughout the 1990 's .
these and many other public appearances where he freely made his pronouncements on german books and writing have made him one of germany 's best-known cultural critics .
reich-ranicki , who is celebrating his 90th birthday on june 2 , is also one of just a handful of jewish public figures in germany to resettle in the country after having survived world war ii .
born in 1920 in wloclawek , poland , the future critic attended high school in berlin .
because he was jewish , he was denied entry to the university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the critic , just ending his ninth decade , is still up for an argument after being deported to poland , reich-ranicki was able to flee the warsaw ghetto with his wife , tosia .
in 1958 , he returned to germany and dedicated himself to the study of german language and literature - and saw an opening for himself in the world of german letters .
risky career move " when i came to germany in ' 58 , and i saw what people were writing about literature in the -lsb- newspapers here , -rsb- i told my wife : i want to do an experiment , " reich-ranicki said in an acceptance speech after receiving the north rhine-westphalia state prize in 2005 .
" these people write so confusingly , so cryptically , i just do n't like their criticism , " he continued .
" i will say loud and clear what i think about books .
it is risky , and two things could happen : i will either rise to the top of the literary criticism hierarchy , or sink to the very bottom .
but i have to try . "
reich-ranicki has remained incorruptible and sharp in his opinions , and he does n't mince words .
that attitude has cost him a few friends over the years .
his dedication to speaking the truth as he sees it was behind a major uproar in 2008 , when he was invited to receive an honorary german television prize for his cultural contributions .
as recipients awaiting awards usually do , he sat passively in the audience as one tv personality after another came up to make a speech , accept an award , or tell a few jokes .
critic who speaks his mind he was definitely not impressed with what he saw - and he made no secret of his feelings .
when the time came for him to accept his honorary award , he stunned viewers by rejecting it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel awarded reich-ranicki the henri-nannen prize in 2008 " i can not accept this prize , " reich-ranicki told the shocked audience .
" i did n't know what to expect here , and i think it is awful that i had to sit through this for so many hours . "
at first , some of the guests at the ceremony thought reich-ranicki was joking .
but in this case he was simply telling it like he saw it - live and on the air .
by giving an open , radical critique of what he saw as the poor state of german television , reich-ranicki underlined his reputation as something of a crank , not to mention a " hard taskmaster " and a " a specialist in executions , " as different critics have put it .
reich-ranicki answers his detractors by saying that indeed , his first and foremost job is to be tough and critical .
years on ' literary quartet ' " being called an ' execution specialist ' is really nonsense , " reich-ranicki told broadcaster wdr in a 1986 interview .
" but i try to be clear in my criticism .
and the clarity of criticism , well , that is a question of politesse .
you have to be polite to the readers .
and that means being clear and explicit with your meaning , not hiding behind ambiguous or enigmatic phrases . "
his appearances as the head critic on television 's " literary quartet " between 1988 and 2001 brought reich-ranicki to the small screen some 77 times - automatically launching him to the top of germany 's lit-crit pop cultural heap .
despite his fame , however , he certainly is n't infallible .
and if he had a reputation for judging literature based more on his personal reading preferences than on serious criticism , well , that did n't stop his opinion from making and breaking many a literary career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his 2008 rejection of the german tv prize came as a shock those who raised his wrath - peter handke , guenter grass or martin walser , for example - had to fight their way into the market .
on the contrary , favorites such as spanish writer javier marias or berlin chronicler judith hermann more or less owe their success to reich-ranicki 's praises .
boring book ?
bad news the worst thing that reich-ranicki could say about a book was : " boring . "
his anti-academic , folksy and agreeably polemical ideas about literature can most likely be traced back to his own , sad biography .
as a persecuted jew he escaped the warsaw ghetto and various deportations , as though by a miracle .
at the time , a polish printer hid reich-ranicki and his wife from the nazis .
in payment , the literature lover regaled his benefactors with an endless slew of stories : shakespeare , goethe , schiller , etc .
telling stories to stay alive - the experience made a lasting impression on reich-ranicki , whose biggest successes came when he broke literary-criticism taboos .
years later , he wrote his own life story , and - unlike the biographies of many other critics - this one became a bestseller .

some analysts are saying the next days will be crucial for its future . in an editorial , the website of german public broadcaster zdf said " the fate of this -lsb- government -rsb- coalition will be decided in the next ten days . "
that 's a drastic view , but there 's no doubt that the resignation of the german president , horst koehler , on monday has delivered a major blow to the government .
it has many important issues to be dealing with : the crisis in the eurozone , the need for drastic savings , or the military involvement in afghanistan , to mention just a few .
and the government coalition , made up of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , has a few crises of its own : the poor showing of the two parties in the indecisive regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the sudden resignation of powerful regional leader roland koch in hessen , the internal backbiting within the liberal party , and disastrous opinion poll ratings .
so the chancellor , angela merkel , could well do without the scramble to find a convincing new president within 30 days , as required by the constitution .
is it a crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she regretted koehler 's departure and had tried to change his mind in a major interview on the evening of koehler 's resignation , she insisted , " we have to be sure not to make a crisis out of every challenge . "
but peter stuetzle , head of deutsche welle 's berlin office , thinks that a crisis is exactly what this is .
" this has been one too much for the government , " he says .
" there 's been a lot of trouble , and the government was just about to try to leave all that behind , and in this minute , koehler resigns . "
if the current government were doing well , the resignation would just be a nuisance , but it 's a sign of the government 's problems that the nuisance was immediately seen as a crisis .
all at sea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's coalition partners have already said they 'll leave the choice up to her wolfgang bosbach , a senior cdu backbencher , says that people do n't trust politicians of any party to solve the country 's problems , and so when respected figures like koehler or koch resign , the people feel that " the good people have left the ship , and we do n't how we will carry on in this rough sea . " what he , as a government supporter , fails to mention , is that , even if the people are disillusioned with all politicians , it 's his coalition which has the power to pilot the ship , and so that 's where the criticism hits particularly hard .
merkel has often been criticized for her lack of leadership - she tends to sit things out and wait until a consensus emerges - but the choice of a new president will require decisive action . peter stuetzle thinks the whole coalition has recognized the need .
her partners - not just the liberals , but also her bavarian sister-party , the csu - have agreed that they will do without their own candidates , and let her make the choice . " everything will be very fast , " he thinks , " and if it 's fast , and if it 's convincing too , then the government might even come out of the whole thing with a better public image at the end of the day .

some analysts are saying the next days will be crucial for its future . in an editorial , the website of german public broadcaster zdf said " the fate of this -lsb- government -rsb- coalition will be decided in the next ten days . "
that 's a drastic view , but there 's no doubt that the resignation of the german president , horst koehler , on monday has delivered a major blow to the government .
it has many important issues to be dealing with : the crisis in the eurozone , the need for drastic savings , or the military involvement in afghanistan , to mention just a few .
and the government coalition , made up of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , has a few crises of its own : the poor showing of the two parties in the indecisive regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the sudden resignation of powerful regional leader roland koch in hessen , the internal backbiting within the liberal party , and disastrous opinion poll ratings .
so the chancellor , angela merkel , could well do without the scramble to find a convincing new president within 30 days , as required by the constitution .
is it a crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she regretted koehler 's departure and had tried to change his mind in a major interview on the evening of koehler 's resignation , she insisted , " we have to be sure not to make a crisis out of every challenge . "
but peter stuetzle , head of deutsche welle 's berlin office , thinks that a crisis is exactly what this is .
" this has been one too much for the government , " he says .
" there 's been a lot of trouble , and the government was just about to try to leave all that behind , and in this minute , koehler resigns . "
if the current government were doing well , the resignation would just be a nuisance , but it 's a sign of the government 's problems that the nuisance was immediately seen as a crisis .

" what he , as a government supporter , fails to mention , is that , even if the people are disillusioned with all politicians , it 's his coalition which has the power to pilot the ship , and so that 's where the criticism hits particularly hard .
merkel has often been criticized for her lack of leadership - she tends to sit things out and wait until a consensus emerges - but the choice of a new president will require decisive action . peter stuetzle thinks the whole coalition has recognized the need .
her partners - not just the liberals , but also her bavarian sister-party , the csu - have agreed that they will do without their own candidates , and let her make the choice . " everything will be very fast , " he thinks , " and if it 's fast , and if it 's convincing too , then the government might even come out of the whole thing with a better public image at the end of the day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 02.06.2010 irascible german literary critic reich-ranicki turns 90 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki had an idea early on of a new style of literary criticism marcel reich-ranicki is germany 's best known literary critic .
his long career and definitive pronouncements have earned him the irreverent nickname " the pope of german letters . "
on june 2 , he turns 90 . marcel reich-ranicki was in charge of the literature section of the national newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in the 1970s , and hosted the television book discussion program " literary quartet " throughout the 1990 's .
these and many other public appearances where he freely made his pronouncements on german books and writing have made him one of germany 's best-known cultural critics .
reich-ranicki , who is celebrating his 90th birthday on june 2 , is also one of just a handful of jewish public figures in germany to resettle in the country after having survived world war ii .
born in 1920 in wloclawek , poland , the future critic attended high school in berlin .
because he was jewish , he was denied entry to the university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the critic , just ending his ninth decade , is still up for an argument after being deported to poland , reich-ranicki was able to flee the warsaw ghetto with his wife , tosia .
in 1958 , he returned to germany and dedicated himself to the study of german language and literature - and saw an opening for himself in the world of german letters .
risky career move " when i came to germany in ' 58 , and i saw what people were writing about literature in the -lsb- newspapers here , -rsb- i told my wife : i want to do an experiment , " reich-ranicki said in an acceptance speech after receiving the north rhine-westphalia state prize in 2005 .
" these people write so confusingly , so cryptically , i just do n't like their criticism , " he continued .
" i will say loud and clear what i think about books .
it is risky , and two things could happen : i will either rise to the top of the literary criticism hierarchy , or sink to the very bottom .
but i have to try . "
reich-ranicki has remained incorruptible and sharp in his opinions , and he does n't mince words .
that attitude has cost him a few friends over the years .
his dedication to speaking the truth as he sees it was behind a major uproar in 2008 , when he was invited to receive an honorary german television prize for his cultural contributions .
as recipients awaiting awards usually do , he sat passively in the audience as one tv personality after another came up to make a speech , accept an award , or tell a few jokes .
critic who speaks his mind he was definitely not impressed with what he saw - and he made no secret of his feelings .
when the time came for him to accept his honorary award , he stunned viewers by rejecting it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel awarded reich-ranicki the henri-nannen prize in 2008 " i can not accept this prize , " reich-ranicki told the shocked audience .
" i did n't know what to expect here , and i think it is awful that i had to sit through this for so many hours . "
at first , some of the guests at the ceremony thought reich-ranicki was joking .
but in this case he was simply telling it like he saw it - live and on the air .
by giving an open , radical critique of what he saw as the poor state of german television , reich-ranicki underlined his reputation as something of a crank , not to mention a " hard taskmaster " and a " a specialist in executions , " as different critics have put it .
reich-ranicki answers his detractors by saying that indeed , his first and foremost job is to be tough and critical .
years on ' literary quartet ' " being called an ' execution specialist ' is really nonsense , " reich-ranicki told broadcaster wdr in a 1986 interview .
" but i try to be clear in my criticism .
and the clarity of criticism , well , that is a question of politesse .
you have to be polite to the readers .
and that means being clear and explicit with your meaning , not hiding behind ambiguous or enigmatic phrases . "
his appearances as the head critic on television 's " literary quartet " between 1988 and 2001 brought reich-ranicki to the small screen some 77 times - automatically launching him to the top of germany 's lit-crit pop cultural heap .
despite his fame , however , he certainly is n't infallible .
and if he had a reputation for judging literature based more on his personal reading preferences than on serious criticism , well , that did n't stop his opinion from making and breaking many a literary career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his 2008 rejection of the german tv prize came as a shock those who raised his wrath - peter handke , guenter grass or martin walser , for example - had to fight their way into the market .
on the contrary , favorites such as spanish writer javier marias or berlin chronicler judith hermann more or less owe their success to reich-ranicki 's praises .
boring book ?
bad news the worst thing that reich-ranicki could say about a book was : " boring . "
his anti-academic , folksy and agreeably polemical ideas about literature can most likely be traced back to his own , sad biography .
as a persecuted jew he escaped the warsaw ghetto and various deportations , as though by a miracle .
at the time , a polish printer hid reich-ranicki and his wife from the nazis .
in payment , the literature lover regaled his benefactors with an endless slew of stories : shakespeare , goethe , schiller , etc .
telling stories to stay alive - the experience made a lasting impression on reich-ranicki , whose biggest successes came when he broke literary-criticism taboos .
years later , he wrote his own life story , and - unlike the biographies of many other critics - this one became a bestseller .

although polish and russian investigators have not made any final conclusions , transcripts of the black-box cockpit recorders seem to support the theory that pilot error and poor conditions led to the crash .
the plane carrying kacynski and 95 other people , among them high-ranking government officials , crashed as it came in for a landing at smolensk airport in russia .
despite warnings from russian air traffic controllers - which can be heard on the black-box recordings - the pilots decided to attempt a landing anyway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski 's funeral followed a week after the crash " thank you , " said the chief pilot , arkadiusz protasiuk , on the recording , referring to the air traffic controller 's weather warning .
" if it 's possible , we 'll make an attempt , but if the weather is n't good we 'll go for a second pass . "
the pilots then began normal landing procedures .
about two minutes before the crash , alarms indicating " terrain ahead " with warnings to " pull up " repeatedly sounded in the cockpit .
these warnings went unheeded by the pilots until it was too late .
no indication of pressure from passengers in the polish media it had been speculated that pressure on the pilots to land , possibly from kaczynski himself , had contributed to the tragedy .
kaczynski and his delegation were running late for a planned ceremony in the katyn forest that marked the murder of 22,000 poles 70 years ago .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski and his wife both died in the crash however , the cockpit recordings provided no evidence to support this theory .
the voice of mariusz kazana , head of poland 's diplomatic protocol , can be heard telling the pilots " well , then we have a problem " if the plane were unable to land on the first try .
kazana can also be heard saying that there had been " no decision from the president on what to do . "
the pilots seemed to think that their landing attempt would not be possible due to the weather and that they would have to pull up for another pass or land at a different airport .
the last bit of audio recorded on the black box is the sound of the plane hitting a tree and an unidentified person in the cockpit cursing in polish .
the plane then flipped and crashed , killing everyone on board. mz / reuters / afp / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she denounces the government 's anti-maoist offensive , which has been codenamed operation green hunt . " it has gone terribly wrong , " she told deutsche welle .
" to try and sort out this very deep problem militarily is to create a situation , which is quickly spiraling out of anybody 's ability to extract any kind of morality out of the various atrocities that are taking place .

the levers of government , she maintained , are increasingly controlled by private entities . " india today is a country where a lot of the growth rate is fuelled by this mining money , " she reiterated to deutsche welle .

the ban " concerns securities that registered on a regulated german market , " a finance ministry said .
the ban also encompasses certain trades on currencies that are not used for hedging purposes .
a previous version of the draft law had envisaged a complete ban on short selling currency derivates .
naked short is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
but unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy them back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether .
it is viewed as a far riskier form of trading .
the practice came under fire after greece struggled to raise capital to finance its debt .
naked trades were blamed for artificially inflating the country 's funding costs .
last month , germany stunned its international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide with its plan to temporarily ban naked short selling of some financial shares , sovereign debt bonds and credit default swaps .
after berlin announced its ban last month , christoph schmidt , head of germany 's rwi economics institute , referred to the move as " an isolated step in a globalized world " and doubted it would have an impact .
indeed , most short selling takes place in london ; it is not a common practice in germany .
the draft bill must still be approved by the lower house of german parliament , the bundestag , where chancellor merkel 's coalition government holds a majority .
the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , can delay the bill but not block it indefinitely .

the ban " concerns securities that registered on a regulated german market , " a finance ministry said .
the ban also encompasses certain trades on currencies that are not used for hedging purposes .
a previous version of the draft law had envisaged a complete ban on short selling currency derivates .
naked short is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
but unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy them back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether .
it is viewed as a far riskier form of trading .
the practice came under fire after greece struggled to raise capital to finance its debt .
naked trades were blamed for artificially inflating the country 's funding costs .
last month , germany stunned its international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide with its plan to temporarily ban naked short selling of some financial shares , sovereign debt bonds and credit default swaps .
after berlin announced its ban last month , christoph schmidt , head of germany 's rwi economics institute , referred to the move as " an isolated step in a globalized world " and doubted it would have an impact .
indeed , most short selling takes place in london ; it is not a common practice in germany .
the draft bill must still be approved by the lower house of german parliament , the bundestag , where chancellor merkel 's coalition government holds a majority .
the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , can delay the bill but not block it indefinitely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 02.06.2010 turkey and us face tough decisions on relations after israeli flotilla raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as turkey 's relations with israel dive , ankara looks to the us while its relations with israel continue to plummet to new depths in the wake of the gaza flotilla raid , turkey is considering how to handle the us as washington tries to balance its ties with jerusalem and ankara . few countries are more enraged by israel 's raid on the gaza aid flotilla than turkey .
much of the action during monday 's pre-dawn raid by israeli commandos was focused on a turkish-flagged ship and at least four of the nine fatalities arising from the attack were pro-palestinian turks . in the days following , relations between turkey and israel have been strained to breaking point with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan calling the raid a " bloody massacre " and accusing israel of " unacceptable lawlessness . " erdogan has even gone so far as to refer to israel - a close partner since diplomatic ties with the jewish state were established in 1949 - as " a festering boil in the middle east that spreads hate and enmity , dynamites regional peace and spreads instability . " in such a situation , it is unsurprising that relations between turkey and israel are currently plummeting to an all-time low , even lower than when the relationship soured over israel 's military operations in gaza in 2008 .
but experts are also watching closely how relations between turkey and israel 's most powerful ally – the united states – will develop as the shockwaves from the flotilla raid ripple on . a furious erdogan wasted no time calling us president barack obama after the incident . " israel is faced with the danger of losing its sole friend in the region and the greatest contributor so far to regional peace , " erdogan told the us president in a one-hour telephone conversation , according to a turkish government statement on wednesday . bildunterschrift : erdogan suggested that turkey could abandon israel but trade and military ties remain too strong turkey-israel ties ' too strong to break ' turkey has been israel 's chief regional ally since a military cooperation deal was signed between the two countries in 1996 .
however , some sections of the us media claim the implication behind erdogan 's statement is that turkey , with its mainly muslim population , could shift its allegiance towards its new-found friends in the arab world , partners which the islamist-rooted government in ankara have been courting for some time . joost lagendijk , a senior advisor at the istanbul policy center , disagrees .
he believes that the connections between turkey and israel are too strong to be severed . " while we will see the two sides divided at an official , political level , turkey and israel will still have strong military and business ties , " he told deutsche welle . " it makes good sense to have good relations with the arabs but rejecting israel for the arabs is not a viable alternative . " while relations – especially those concerning trade – have been improving over the past few years with a host of arab nations , including syria , iran , lebanon and jordan , turkey still has its eyes set on europe and eu membership .
the european union is still the main power that turkey trusts most in the international arena , despite the eu 's continued ambivalence towards ankara 's accession hopes . however , some observers claim that the israeli raid offers turkey an opportunity to dangle the possibility of an eastward shift in the face of the united states to gain some leverage in a number of issues .
joost lagendijk believes it would be foolish to do so . " turkey 's standing in the middle east and its dealing with its arab partners are only possible because it has such good connections with both the us and the eu , ” he said .
“ that 's what makes turkey such an interesting partner to the arabs .
what would the value of turkey be without that ? " steven cook , a middle east expert at the council on foreign relations , believes turkey will pursue its own goals in the middle east and wo n't feel the need to pressure the us into supporting it . " turkey has economic , political and strategic interests in the arab middle east and turkish leaders obviously feel less inhibited to pursue their own interests in the region , regardless of washington 's wishes , " he told deutsche welle .
" the turks are willing to bend the regional rules of the game to serve ankara 's own interests .
if the resulting policies serve us goals at the same time , all well and good .
if not , so be it . " the united states may be closely watching turkey 's growing connection to regional arab powers but is unlikely to feel any threat from its closer ties with the likes of iran and syria .
despite its ambitions , turkey 's current economic and strategic power is still not enough to project discernible influence in the middle east and it still requires good relations with the us and eu to add weight to its status in the region . us looking to keep muslim ally turkey on side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain good relations with turkey bilateral relations by their nature have mutual benefits and turkey is n't the only partner seeking support .
the united states sees turkey as a key muslim ally and the obama administration has been working hard to repair the damage to relations caused by the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion . since then , the us and turkey have set-up intelligence sharing networks in the on-going fight against international terrorism while turkey hosts the us military infrastructure needed for its missions in neighbouring iraq and afghanistan . " turkey is still a key muslim ally to the us and is a favorite partner , one which is held up as an example of a predominantly islamic country with a growing democracy , " joost lagendijk said .
" the us wo n't want to jeapordise that .
if it turns on turkey for any reason , then the whole rhetoric washington has created about reforming the islamic world will crumble . " despite this , steven cook says , the two nations are increasingly finding themselves at odds with each other . " washington and ankara do share the same goals : peace between israel and the palestinians ; a stable , unified iraq ; an iran without nuclear weapons ; stability in afghanistan ; and a western-oriented syria , " he said . " when you get down to details , however , washington and ankara are on the opposite ends of virtually all these issues . " but after six decades of strategic cooperation , the stark reality is that while turkey and the united states are not enemies in the middle east , they are fast becoming strategic competitors . " turkey is asserting itself more in the middle east , where it has gone from a tepid observer to an influential player in eight short years , " cook added . washington faces balancing act with ankara , jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ties with israel will impact on its relations with turkey while turkey and the united states will not want to fall out , the situation arising from the israeli flotilla raid may still give turkey an opportunity to press its own agenda while maintaining strong ties with the us .
as pressure from the international community grows , turkey currently stands a greater chance at getting its own way over ending the blockade of gaza " the world has woken up to the gaza situation and now it is not only turkey calling for the end of the blockade , ” lagendijk said .
“ turkey , if it is clever , can use this to pressure the us which itself is growing more frustrated with the netanyahu government in israel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 02.06.2010 turkey and us face tough decisions on relations after israeli flotilla raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as turkey 's relations with israel dive , ankara looks to the us while its relations with israel continue to plummet to new depths in the wake of the gaza flotilla raid , turkey is considering how to handle the us as washington tries to balance its ties with jerusalem and ankara . few countries are more enraged by israel 's raid on the gaza aid flotilla than turkey .
much of the action during monday 's pre-dawn raid by israeli commandos was focused on a turkish-flagged ship and at least four of the nine fatalities arising from the attack were pro-palestinian turks . in the days following , relations between turkey and israel have been strained to breaking point with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan calling the raid a " bloody massacre " and accusing israel of " unacceptable lawlessness . " erdogan has even gone so far as to refer to israel - a close partner since diplomatic ties with the jewish state were established in 1949 - as " a festering boil in the middle east that spreads hate and enmity , dynamites regional peace and spreads instability . " in such a situation , it is unsurprising that relations between turkey and israel are currently plummeting to an all-time low , even lower than when the relationship soured over israel 's military operations in gaza in 2008 .
but experts are also watching closely how relations between turkey and israel 's most powerful ally – the united states – will develop as the shockwaves from the flotilla raid ripple on . a furious erdogan wasted no time calling us president barack obama after the incident . " israel is faced with the danger of losing its sole friend in the region and the greatest contributor so far to regional peace , " erdogan told the us president in a one-hour telephone conversation , according to a turkish government statement on wednesday . bildunterschrift : erdogan suggested that turkey could abandon israel but trade and military ties remain too strong turkey-israel ties ' too strong to break ' turkey has been israel 's chief regional ally since a military cooperation deal was signed between the two countries in 1996 .
however , some sections of the us media claim the implication behind erdogan 's statement is that turkey , with its mainly muslim population , could shift its allegiance towards its new-found friends in the arab world , partners which the islamist-rooted government in ankara have been courting for some time . joost lagendijk , a senior advisor at the istanbul policy center , disagrees .
he believes that the connections between turkey and israel are too strong to be severed . " while we will see the two sides divided at an official , political level , turkey and israel will still have strong military and business ties , " he told deutsche welle . " it makes good sense to have good relations with the arabs but rejecting israel for the arabs is not a viable alternative . " while relations – especially those concerning trade – have been improving over the past few years with a host of arab nations , including syria , iran , lebanon and jordan , turkey still has its eyes set on europe and eu membership .
the european union is still the main power that turkey trusts most in the international arena , despite the eu 's continued ambivalence towards ankara 's accession hopes . however , some observers claim that the israeli raid offers turkey an opportunity to dangle the possibility of an eastward shift in the face of the united states to gain some leverage in a number of issues .
joost lagendijk believes it would be foolish to do so . " turkey 's standing in the middle east and its dealing with its arab partners are only possible because it has such good connections with both the us and the eu , ” he said .
“ that 's what makes turkey such an interesting partner to the arabs .
what would the value of turkey be without that ? " steven cook , a middle east expert at the council on foreign relations , believes turkey will pursue its own goals in the middle east and wo n't feel the need to pressure the us into supporting it . " turkey has economic , political and strategic interests in the arab middle east and turkish leaders obviously feel less inhibited to pursue their own interests in the region , regardless of washington 's wishes , " he told deutsche welle .
" the turks are willing to bend the regional rules of the game to serve ankara 's own interests .
if the resulting policies serve us goals at the same time , all well and good .
if not , so be it . " the united states may be closely watching turkey 's growing connection to regional arab powers but is unlikely to feel any threat from its closer ties with the likes of iran and syria .
despite its ambitions , turkey 's current economic and strategic power is still not enough to project discernible influence in the middle east and it still requires good relations with the us and eu to add weight to its status in the region . us looking to keep muslim ally turkey on side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain good relations with turkey bilateral relations by their nature have mutual benefits and turkey is n't the only partner seeking support .

the defense ministry is expected to tighten its belt , which could lead to a reduction of bundeswehr troops . cutting troop numbers in the german bundeswehr is one option under consideration as the german government prepares to meet on sunday and monday to come up with ways to plug large gaps in its deficit-laden budget .
german military spending is one area where significant savings could be made and according to media reports , defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg is considering several money-saving measures .
one consideration would be a reduction in the number of bundeswehr soldiers by nearly half .
according to the suttgarter zeitung and the hamburger abendblatt newspapers , one possibility would be to cut the number of troops from around 250,000 to 150,000 .

it would represent a large chunk of the 1 billion euros the defense ministry hopes to cut from its 31-billion-euro budget .
a law has already been introduced in the german parliament that would reduce the length of military service from nine to six months .

however , his surprise resignation may jeopardize the success of his african projects . as the german president , horst koehler travelled the world .
on state visits , people saw a president that was interested in different cultures and societies .
but koehler was always fond of one continent in particular : africa .
he did not overlook africa 's ills and when he described them , he did not mince his words either .
but with koehler having left office , there is a looming danger that africa will fall back to the bottom of the political agenda in germany again .
new german presidents usually do not continue projects started by their predecessors , because they want to set their own political focus .
in this case , it likely wo n't include africa .
that is a shame , say experts , because when it came to corruption , civil war or lack of political leadership , the former president said what he thought – even if he was addressing african heads of state at the african union 's assembly .
at the same time , he did not ignore the many positive signs on the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler dances with ghanian president john agyekum kufuor in 2007 " civil society is growing across africa .
more and more people refuse to give in to their destinies .
farmers come together to buy fertilizer or to build wells .
civil society groups fight against corruption and put their governments to task .
women take the initiative to built schools or clinics for aids patients , ” koehler once said in a speech .
whether it was praise or criticism – horst koehler 's main priority was to establish a dialogue of equals between africans and germans .
in his first speech to parliament in july 2004 , koehler made it clear that africa was a priority for him .
" it is my conviction that the humanity of our world will be measured against the fate of africa , " koehler told members of germany 's lower house , the bundestag .
imf legacy troublesome at first but most african leaders did not start cheering at his words right away .
" there were many people in africa in the beginning that automatically identified horst koehler with the international monetary fund , " said ulf engel , a scholar in the africa department of the university of leipzig .
koehler had been at the helm of the international monetary fund until he was elected president .
the fund is notorious in africa for koehler 's structural adjustment policies , cost-cutting measures aimed at reducing public debts .
the imf forced various african countries to introduce school fees or make visits to the hospital more expensive as part of structural adjustment .
but koehler soon managed to change his perception in africa through his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited a youth center in rwanda in 2008 “ he gained a lot of popularity in africa when he started his ' partnership with africa ' initiative , " said engel .
partnership with africa was koehler 's pet project .
it was his attempt to make a direct contribution to the establishment of a dialogue of equals in real life .
it was n't just members of germany 's and africa 's political and business elite who discussed topics such as the difficult relationship between africa and europe or the challenges faced by africa 's youth .
promising young people known as " future leaders " from africa and germany also always sat at the table .
all words , no action ?
critics sometimes commented that the meetings were just another talking shop .
they liked to complain that africa did not need more words , but action .
but as the university of leipzig 's engel says , koehler was able to consistently make a clear statement about the policies regarding africa .
" some politicians were clearly uncomfortable when he took a firm stand on issues that he felt the west needed to change .
a reduction of subsidies for western products for instance , or the need to take africa seriously , " engel said .
germany 's constitution did not give koehler much room to put his political ideas into practice .
according to the law , the president has little political power .
instead , he had to use the power of words to influence german politics , and that power was n't always enough .
“ it 's tragic that he did not manage to make politicians in berlin listen to him , " said engel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 02.06.2010 with cinema jenin , a dream is fulfilled for palestinian youth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the restoration was driven by the parents of ahmed khatib german filmmaker marcus vetter is close to completing the restoration of a cinema in jenin , a town in the palestinian west bank .
the cinema was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago . marcus vetter made a film in jenin three years ago - and stayed on to build a cinema in which to show it .
his documentary film , " the heart of jenin , " is about ahmed khatib , a palestinian boy killed by israeli troops while playing with a toy gun in the town 's refugee camp .
his parents decided to donate their son 's organs to save the lives of other children - arab and israeli .
the documentary won several awards , but it could n't be shown in jenin , where it all happened .
the town 's only movie theater was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago .
ahmed 's parents asked vetter to help renovate and reopen it , because they wanted to create more opportunities for local children .
he agreed , although he 'd never funded or managed a building project before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcus vetter with one of the palestinian teens who 's been helping on the project " you ca n't open such a place just by helping .
it 's impossible as i realized very fast .
this is real work .
what i could have helped with was fundraising , but raising money is nothing - raising money just means corruption , " said vetter .
vetter has run things in an unorthodox way .
he did n't apply for funding before starting .
he just began , with no salaries at all to pay the german architects and engineers .
they 're volunteers .
" just take a step , that 's what we did here , just renovate , do n't talk all the time , and do it with all your passion , " said vetter .
the project is ambitious .
vetter and his team are renovating the old indoor cinema , building an outdoor one , adding a cafe and guest house , as well as setting up a film production and distribution company .
government , private donors covered costs so far , the project has cost more than half a million euros .
most of the money has come from the german government , with the rest from corporate donors and ordinary people .
along the way , money has always been tight .
earlier this year , vetter simply ran out of cash .
he wrote to six donors saying he needed 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- to finish the job .
only one of them replied - legendary british musician roger waters , of pink floyd fame .
" having met all the people involved i felt connected to them and i felt it was the least i could do to give them the money to finish the project , " said waters , talking by phone from the united states .
waters says he was inspired to help by the generosity of ahmed khatib 's father .
" this project was fundamentally and always attached to that story , that incredibly moving story .
he gives the rest of us hope that we may at some point find a partial solution to the plight the palestinian people find themselves in , " said waters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck delivers all the technical equipment to the cinema dialogue with other cultures fakhri hamad , the project manager for cinema jenin , says the project is changing the town .
" we started with a small idea to have a place for kids to play and learn but it 's had local and international support , and it 's grown and grown .
now it 's become a project of the town itself .
jenin has the chance to prove it 's ready to accept other cultures , to accept peace and to accept dialogue , " said hamad .
it 's been a huge turnaround for jenin , a town with a population of around 250,000 which became known as the source of a third of the suicide bombers of the palestinian uprising known as the second intifada .
now , young palestinians are learning about filmmaking side by side with german students , as well as working on the building site together .
opposition from intellectuals but there has been some palestinian opposition to the project .
earlier this year , palestinian intellectuals criticized cinema jenin , arguing that it " normalized " relations between palestinians and israel .
they said the project relied on cooperation with israel and that they opposed building a cinema while israel 's occupation army remained in the west bank .
vetter admits that he was discouraged .
" i did think then that the project might fail .
i thought that i ca n't keep giving my time to a project which has a fundamentalist approach .
it was very depressing , " said vetter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's still a long way to go on the building site but the faith of ordinary people in the project restored vetter 's commitment , as did the unswerving determination of ahmed khatib 's parents .
for them , cinema jenin is the fulfilment of a dream .
they want the town 's young people to have more of everything than their son had - more opportunities , more of a future , and of course more security .
when he died , ahmed saved the lives of the five children who received his organs .
with this movie theater , established in his memory , they hope he will touch the lives of countless more .
opening in time for world cup cinema jenin is now almost complete .
the members of the project team hope to open the outdoor cinema in time for the world cup later this month .
the official opening of the restored indoor cinema is scheduled for august .

turkey has attempted to play mediator in middle east , but that was before an israeli military attack on a turkish aid ship .
ankara is playing with fire , says baha guengoer of deutsche welle 's turkish service . the whole world knows that israel is not squeamish about enforcing its interests .
and in light of the latest attacks on gaza , it is a fact that israel will not hesitate violating human rights under the pretext of self-defense and attacking people with brute military force without regard for civilian casualties .
the question must be asked : what was the purpose of the actions of this independent turkish aid organization ?
the officially stated goals were not achieved ; the flotilla could neither break the israeli naval blockade nor bring relief supplies directly to gaza .
for weeks , israel had communicated to turkey through all available diplomatic channels that such aid action would , if necessary , be stopped with violence .
israel made good on its threats and boarded the largest ship of the maritime aid convoy , contravening international maritime law .
in the process there was a shoot-out : at least nine people died and dozens more were injured .
and now , the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan rages unchecked against israel and is playing a dangerous game .
turkey has been a nato member for almost 60 years .
as an ally in the western defense alliance , turkey has a peace obligation .
recent turkish diplomacy has succeeded in smoothing the tensions between iran and the west and mediating between syria and israel while remaining credible in the process .
but with this week 's incident , turkey has reduced itself to just another member of the anti-israel front in the middle east .
at the very least , turkey 's credibility regarding future mediation is put in doubt .
the turkish ship was decorated with giant turkish and palestinian flags .
the image of the incident was that israeli soldiers captured a turkish ship .
in turkey , tens of thousands of demonstrators were mobilized and laid siege to israel 's diplomatic missions .
prime minister erdogan raged on against israel , speaking of " state terrorism , " a " regime of lies " and arguing that israel must now be " punished . "
according to erdogan , whoever chooses to ignore the atrocities of israel makes himself " complicit in the crime against humanity . "
the arduous international efforts to achieve a lasting peace in the middle east are important to turkey , as is the peace process in the caucasus or the balkans .
therefore , they should not be harnessed to the cart of discordant states in the middle east that lack basic democratic structures . there are very few , barely audible voices in turkey that warn against a further verbal escalation .
in europe , the erdogan 's arguments fall on stunned ears .
although he condemns anti-semitism and promises the jewish community in his country security , the waves of anti-israeli hatred have reached turkey .
one of the few sensible voices in europe came from ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign committee of the german bundestag .
he called , contrary to the stance of germany 's christian democrats , for attempts to further motivate turkey towards eu membership rather than to reject it on religious and cultural grounds . it 's easy to see which camp turkey will fall into if its bid for eu membership fails . the eu would be acting in their own foreign policy interests by keeping turkey on the membership track .

and in light of the latest attacks on gaza , it is a fact that israel will not hesitate violating human rights under the pretext of self-defense and attacking people with brute military force without regard for civilian casualties .
the question must be asked : what was the purpose of the actions of this independent turkish aid organization ?
the officially stated goals were not achieved ; the flotilla could neither break the israeli naval blockade nor bring relief supplies directly to gaza .
for weeks , israel had communicated to turkey through all available diplomatic channels that such aid action would , if necessary , be stopped with violence .
israel made good on its threats and boarded the largest ship of the maritime aid convoy , contravening international maritime law .
in the process there was a shoot-out : at least nine people died and dozens more were injured .
and now , the turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan rages unchecked against israel and is playing a dangerous game .
turkey has been a nato member for almost 60 years .
as an ally in the western defense alliance , turkey has a peace obligation .
recent turkish diplomacy has succeeded in smoothing the tensions between iran and the west and mediating between syria and israel while remaining credible in the process .
but with this week 's incident , turkey has reduced itself to just another member of the anti-israel front in the middle east .
at the very least , turkey 's credibility regarding future mediation is put in doubt .
the turkish ship was decorated with giant turkish and palestinian flags .
the image of the incident was that israeli soldiers captured a turkish ship .
in turkey , tens of thousands of demonstrators were mobilized and laid siege to israel 's diplomatic missions .
prime minister erdogan raged on against israel , speaking of " state terrorism , " a " regime of lies " and arguing that israel must now be " punished . "
according to erdogan , whoever chooses to ignore the atrocities of israel makes himself " complicit in the crime against humanity . "
the arduous international efforts to achieve a lasting peace in the middle east are important to turkey , as is the peace process in the caucasus or the balkans .
therefore , they should not be harnessed to the cart of discordant states in the middle east that lack basic democratic structures . there are very few , barely audible voices in turkey that warn against a further verbal escalation .
in europe , the erdogan 's arguments fall on stunned ears .
although he condemns anti-semitism and promises the jewish community in his country security , the waves of anti-israeli hatred have reached turkey .
one of the few sensible voices in europe came from ruprecht polenz , the chairman of the foreign committee of the german bundestag .
he called , contrary to the stance of germany 's christian democrats , for attempts to further motivate turkey towards eu membership rather than to reject it on religious and cultural grounds . it 's easy to see which camp turkey will fall into if its bid for eu membership fails . the eu would be acting in their own foreign policy interests by keeping turkey on the membership track .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 02.06.2010 global military expenditure keeps going up , in spite of the crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense spending continues to grow throughout the world the annual report of the stockholm peace research institute says that the world has never spent more on defense , in spite of the global financial crisis . every year , the stockholm international peace research institute -lrb- sipri -rrb- issues a report surveying international military expenditure .
and if anyone thought that , this time , the financial crisis would have dampened the world 's enthusiasm for bringing death and destruction upon their neighbours , they 'll be disappointed .
military expenditure went up substantially . a sipri report released on wednesday estimates expenditure in 2009 amounted globally to 1.5 trillion dollars , 5.9 percent more than in the previous year .
in fact the crisis may have been one of the reasons for the increase .
dr sam perlo-freeman , head of the military expenditure project at sipri , says that many countries increased public spending generally in 2009 as a way of boosting demand to combat the recession : " although military spending has n't been a big part of economic stimulus packages , public spending has n't been cut yet , " he said .
usa leads again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sipri welcomes us efforts at nuclear disarmament once more , it 's the united states which is at the top of the list , with 53 percent of the world 's expenditure - an increase of 47 billion dollars .
perlo-freeman sees little likelihood of any change in the us strategy of absolute dominance , even under president barack obama .
it 's insurance " against any possible eventuality , " he said .
but the us was not alone : almost every region of the world , apart from some small countries in eastern europe , has increased military expenditure .
countries with significant natural resources have been particularly energetic .
algeria and nigeria have doubled their expenditure , kazakhstan has increased spending by 360 percent , azerbaijan by nearly 500 percent , the democratic republic of congo by as much 663 percent .
nuclear progress every year sipri asks governments directly for their defence spending figures . but they also study national budgets , and call on outside experts to help them , since defence expenditure is often fairly secretive and many projects run over several years .
sipri does see some progress towards a serious reduction in the 8,000 nuclear warheads in the world , thanks to obama 's efforts to reach a wide-ranging disarmament and non-proliferation treaty .
but even there , the increasing isolation of north korea and iran 's questionable nuclear program give grounds for pessimism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this german submarine is on its way to greece german arms trade germany has the world 's seventh largest expenditure on arms , at $ 46 billion -lrb- which is less than the us increase -rrb- .
even within europe , it 's not as big a spender as france or britain .
but what germany and most western european countries have in common is an overall drop in military spending , according to sam perlo-freeman .
" german military spending has been falling gradually , " he said .
" so germany like many countries in western europe does not perceive any clear conventional threat .
and i think most western european countries do not see the threats that do exist , whether it 's climate change or terrorism , as being susceptible to military solutions . "
the world 's gross domestic product fell by 0.9 percent in 2009 , but arms expenditure still went up .
a number of countries , including greece , have said they 're going to cut their expenditure this year or next . it seems they ca n't ignore the financial reality any longer .

the cinema was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago . marcus vetter made a film in jenin three years ago - and stayed on to build a cinema in which to show it .
his documentary film , " the heart of jenin , " is about ahmed khatib , a palestinian boy killed by israeli troops while playing with a toy gun in the town 's refugee camp .
his parents decided to donate their son 's organs to save the lives of other children - arab and israeli .
the documentary won several awards , but it could n't be shown in jenin , where it all happened .
the town 's only movie theater was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago .
ahmed 's parents asked vetter to help renovate and reopen it , because they wanted to create more opportunities for local children .
he agreed , although he 'd never funded or managed a building project before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcus vetter with one of the palestinian teens who 's been helping on the project " you ca n't open such a place just by helping .
it 's impossible as i realized very fast .
this is real work .
what i could have helped with was fundraising , but raising money is nothing - raising money just means corruption , " said vetter .
vetter has run things in an unorthodox way .
he did n't apply for funding before starting .
he just began , with no salaries at all to pay the german architects and engineers .
they 're volunteers .
" just take a step , that 's what we did here , just renovate , do n't talk all the time , and do it with all your passion , " said vetter .
the project is ambitious .
vetter and his team are renovating the old indoor cinema , building an outdoor one , adding a cafe and guest house , as well as setting up a film production and distribution company .
government , private donors covered costs so far , the project has cost more than half a million euros .
most of the money has come from the german government , with the rest from corporate donors and ordinary people .
along the way , money has always been tight .
earlier this year , vetter simply ran out of cash .
he wrote to six donors saying he needed 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- to finish the job .
only one of them replied - legendary british musician roger waters , of pink floyd fame .
" having met all the people involved i felt connected to them and i felt it was the least i could do to give them the money to finish the project , " said waters , talking by phone from the united states .
waters says he was inspired to help by the generosity of ahmed khatib 's father .
" this project was fundamentally and always attached to that story , that incredibly moving story .
he gives the rest of us hope that we may at some point find a partial solution to the plight the palestinian people find themselves in , " said waters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck delivers all the technical equipment to the cinema dialogue with other cultures fakhri hamad , the project manager for cinema jenin , says the project is changing the town .
" we started with a small idea to have a place for kids to play and learn but it 's had local and international support , and it 's grown and grown .
now it 's become a project of the town itself .
jenin has the chance to prove it 's ready to accept other cultures , to accept peace and to accept dialogue , " said hamad .
it 's been a huge turnaround for jenin , a town with a population of around 250,000 which became known as the source of a third of the suicide bombers of the palestinian uprising known as the second intifada .
now , young palestinians are learning about filmmaking side by side with german students , as well as working on the building site together .
opposition from intellectuals but there has been some palestinian opposition to the project .
earlier this year , palestinian intellectuals criticized cinema jenin , arguing that it " normalized " relations between palestinians and israel .
they said the project relied on cooperation with israel and that they opposed building a cinema while israel 's occupation army remained in the west bank .
vetter admits that he was discouraged .
" i did think then that the project might fail .
i thought that i ca n't keep giving my time to a project which has a fundamentalist approach .
it was very depressing , " said vetter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's still a long way to go on the building site but the faith of ordinary people in the project restored vetter 's commitment , as did the unswerving determination of ahmed khatib 's parents .
for them , cinema jenin is the fulfilment of a dream .
they want the town 's young people to have more of everything than their son had - more opportunities , more of a future , and of course more security .
when he died , ahmed saved the lives of the five children who received his organs .
with this movie theater , established in his memory , they hope he will touch the lives of countless more .
opening in time for world cup cinema jenin is now almost complete .
the members of the project team hope to open the outdoor cinema in time for the world cup later this month .
the official opening of the restored indoor cinema is scheduled for august .

opposition from intellectuals but there has been some palestinian opposition to the project .
earlier this year , palestinian intellectuals criticized cinema jenin , arguing that it " normalized " relations between palestinians and israel .
they said the project relied on cooperation with israel and that they opposed building a cinema while israel 's occupation army remained in the west bank .
vetter admits that he was discouraged .
" i did think then that the project might fail .
i thought that i ca n't keep giving my time to a project which has a fundamentalist approach .
it was very depressing , " said vetter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's still a long way to go on the building site but the faith of ordinary people in the project restored vetter 's commitment , as did the unswerving determination of ahmed khatib 's parents .
for them , cinema jenin is the fulfilment of a dream .
they want the town 's young people to have more of everything than their son had - more opportunities , more of a future , and of course more security .
when he died , ahmed saved the lives of the five children who received his organs .
with this movie theater , established in his memory , they hope he will touch the lives of countless more .
opening in time for world cup cinema jenin is now almost complete .
the members of the project team hope to open the outdoor cinema in time for the world cup later this month .
the official opening of the restored indoor cinema is scheduled for august .

his long career and definitive pronouncements have earned him the irreverent nickname " the pope of german letters . "
on june 2 , he turns 90 . marcel reich-ranicki was in charge of the literature section of the national newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in the 1970s , and hosted the television book discussion program " literary quartet " throughout the 1990 's .
these and many other public appearances where he freely made his pronouncements on german books and writing have made him one of germany 's best-known cultural critics .
reich-ranicki , who is celebrating his 90th birthday on june 2 , is also one of just a handful of jewish public figures in germany to resettle in the country after having survived world war ii .
born in 1920 in wloclawek , poland , the future critic attended high school in berlin .
because he was jewish , he was denied entry to the university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the critic , just ending his ninth decade , is still up for an argument after being deported to poland , reich-ranicki was able to flee the warsaw ghetto with his wife , tosia .
in 1958 , he returned to germany and dedicated himself to the study of german language and literature - and saw an opening for himself in the world of german letters .
risky career move " when i came to germany in ' 58 , and i saw what people were writing about literature in the -lsb- newspapers here , -rsb- i told my wife : i want to do an experiment , " reich-ranicki said in an acceptance speech after receiving the north rhine-westphalia state prize in 2005 .
" these people write so confusingly , so cryptically , i just do n't like their criticism , " he continued .
" i will say loud and clear what i think about books .
it is risky , and two things could happen : i will either rise to the top of the literary criticism hierarchy , or sink to the very bottom .
but i have to try . "
reich-ranicki has remained incorruptible and sharp in his opinions , and he does n't mince words .
that attitude has cost him a few friends over the years .
his dedication to speaking the truth as he sees it was behind a major uproar in 2008 , when he was invited to receive an honorary german television prize for his cultural contributions .
as recipients awaiting awards usually do , he sat passively in the audience as one tv personality after another came up to make a speech , accept an award , or tell a few jokes .
critic who speaks his mind he was definitely not impressed with what he saw - and he made no secret of his feelings .
when the time came for him to accept his honorary award , he stunned viewers by rejecting it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel awarded reich-ranicki the henri-nannen prize in 2008 " i can not accept this prize , " reich-ranicki told the shocked audience .
" i did n't know what to expect here , and i think it is awful that i had to sit through this for so many hours . "
at first , some of the guests at the ceremony thought reich-ranicki was joking .
but in this case he was simply telling it like he saw it - live and on the air .
by giving an open , radical critique of what he saw as the poor state of german television , reich-ranicki underlined his reputation as something of a crank , not to mention a " hard taskmaster " and a " a specialist in executions , " as different critics have put it .
reich-ranicki answers his detractors by saying that indeed , his first and foremost job is to be tough and critical .
years on ' literary quartet ' " being called an ' execution specialist ' is really nonsense , " reich-ranicki told broadcaster wdr in a 1986 interview .
" but i try to be clear in my criticism .
and the clarity of criticism , well , that is a question of politesse .
you have to be polite to the readers .
and that means being clear and explicit with your meaning , not hiding behind ambiguous or enigmatic phrases . "
his appearances as the head critic on television 's " literary quartet " between 1988 and 2001 brought reich-ranicki to the small screen some 77 times - automatically launching him to the top of germany 's lit-crit pop cultural heap .
despite his fame , however , he certainly is n't infallible .
and if he had a reputation for judging literature based more on his personal reading preferences than on serious criticism , well , that did n't stop his opinion from making and breaking many a literary career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his 2008 rejection of the german tv prize came as a shock those who raised his wrath - peter handke , guenter grass or martin walser , for example - had to fight their way into the market .
on the contrary , favorites such as spanish writer javier marias or berlin chronicler judith hermann more or less owe their success to reich-ranicki 's praises .
boring book ?
bad news the worst thing that reich-ranicki could say about a book was : " boring . "
his anti-academic , folksy and agreeably polemical ideas about literature can most likely be traced back to his own , sad biography .
as a persecuted jew he escaped the warsaw ghetto and various deportations , as though by a miracle .
at the time , a polish printer hid reich-ranicki and his wife from the nazis .
in payment , the literature lover regaled his benefactors with an endless slew of stories : shakespeare , goethe , schiller , etc .
telling stories to stay alive - the experience made a lasting impression on reich-ranicki , whose biggest successes came when he broke literary-criticism taboos .
years later , he wrote his own life story , and - unlike the biographies of many other critics - this one became a bestseller .

but in this case he was simply telling it like he saw it - live and on the air .
by giving an open , radical critique of what he saw as the poor state of german television , reich-ranicki underlined his reputation as something of a crank , not to mention a " hard taskmaster " and a " a specialist in executions , " as different critics have put it .
reich-ranicki answers his detractors by saying that indeed , his first and foremost job is to be tough and critical .
years on ' literary quartet ' " being called an ' execution specialist ' is really nonsense , " reich-ranicki told broadcaster wdr in a 1986 interview .
" but i try to be clear in my criticism .
and the clarity of criticism , well , that is a question of politesse .
you have to be polite to the readers .
and that means being clear and explicit with your meaning , not hiding behind ambiguous or enigmatic phrases . "
his appearances as the head critic on television 's " literary quartet " between 1988 and 2001 brought reich-ranicki to the small screen some 77 times - automatically launching him to the top of germany 's lit-crit pop cultural heap .
despite his fame , however , he certainly is n't infallible .
and if he had a reputation for judging literature based more on his personal reading preferences than on serious criticism , well , that did n't stop his opinion from making and breaking many a literary career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his 2008 rejection of the german tv prize came as a shock those who raised his wrath - peter handke , guenter grass or martin walser , for example - had to fight their way into the market .
on the contrary , favorites such as spanish writer javier marias or berlin chronicler judith hermann more or less owe their success to reich-ranicki 's praises .
boring book ?
bad news the worst thing that reich-ranicki could say about a book was : " boring . "
his anti-academic , folksy and agreeably polemical ideas about literature can most likely be traced back to his own , sad biography .
as a persecuted jew he escaped the warsaw ghetto and various deportations , as though by a miracle .
at the time , a polish printer hid reich-ranicki and his wife from the nazis .
in payment , the literature lover regaled his benefactors with an endless slew of stories : shakespeare , goethe , schiller , etc .
telling stories to stay alive - the experience made a lasting impression on reich-ranicki , whose biggest successes came when he broke literary-criticism taboos .
years later , he wrote his own life story , and - unlike the biographies of many other critics - this one became a bestseller .

balkans welcome in light of the ongoing debt crisis in europe , there was some concern in the balkans that progress would be bogged down on absorbing new nations into the block .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign affairs chief catherine ashton with bosnia -lrb- r -rrb- and spain -lrb- l -rrb- foreign ministers at the meeting but bildt added that he expected " strong reaffirmation by the eu " encouraging the balkan nations to push on with their efforts to join the eu .
spain , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency and organized the meeting , added that balkan countries were welcome in the eu " a very good future for the whole region , a european future , and a commitment of the international community to support all western balkans to join the eu , that is the main message today , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos .
however , many balkan states will be hoping more than rhetoric comes out of the meeting .
this could come in the form of extending the right to travel without visas in the eu 's schengen zone to bosnia and albania , an idea put forth in brussels last week .
this right has already been given to serbia , montenegro and macedonia .
conference downgraded the sarajevo conference was originally planned as a summit , but reconfigured as informal talks because of the current row between serbia and its former province kosovo .
belgrade refuses to acknowledge kosovo , which declared independence from serbia in 2008 , and serbian officials insist they will not formally share any table with their kosovo counterparts . because the conference has revised its format , it will now not issue any formal declaration at the end of proceedings. mz / cb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , his surprise resignation may jeopardize the success of his african projects . as the german president , horst koehler travelled the world .
on state visits , people saw a president that was interested in different cultures and societies .
but koehler was always fond of one continent in particular : africa .
he did not overlook africa 's ills and when he described them , he did not mince his words either .
but with koehler having left office , there is a looming danger that africa will fall back to the bottom of the political agenda in germany again .
new german presidents usually do not continue projects started by their predecessors , because they want to set their own political focus .
in this case , it likely wo n't include africa .
that is a shame , say experts , because when it came to corruption , civil war or lack of political leadership , the former president said what he thought – even if he was addressing african heads of state at the african union 's assembly .
at the same time , he did not ignore the many positive signs on the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler dances with ghanian president john agyekum kufuor in 2007 " civil society is growing across africa .
more and more people refuse to give in to their destinies .
farmers come together to buy fertilizer or to build wells .
civil society groups fight against corruption and put their governments to task .
women take the initiative to built schools or clinics for aids patients , ” koehler once said in a speech .
whether it was praise or criticism – horst koehler 's main priority was to establish a dialogue of equals between africans and germans .
in his first speech to parliament in july 2004 , koehler made it clear that africa was a priority for him .
" it is my conviction that the humanity of our world will be measured against the fate of africa , " koehler told members of germany 's lower house , the bundestag .
imf legacy troublesome at first but most african leaders did not start cheering at his words right away .
" there were many people in africa in the beginning that automatically identified horst koehler with the international monetary fund , " said ulf engel , a scholar in the africa department of the university of leipzig .
koehler had been at the helm of the international monetary fund until he was elected president .
the fund is notorious in africa for koehler 's structural adjustment policies , cost-cutting measures aimed at reducing public debts .
the imf forced various african countries to introduce school fees or make visits to the hospital more expensive as part of structural adjustment .
but koehler soon managed to change his perception in africa through his work .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler visited a youth center in rwanda in 2008 “ he gained a lot of popularity in africa when he started his ' partnership with africa ' initiative , " said engel .
partnership with africa was koehler 's pet project .
it was his attempt to make a direct contribution to the establishment of a dialogue of equals in real life .
it was n't just members of germany 's and africa 's political and business elite who discussed topics such as the difficult relationship between africa and europe or the challenges faced by africa 's youth .
promising young people known as " future leaders " from africa and germany also always sat at the table .
all words , no action ?
critics sometimes commented that the meetings were just another talking shop .
they liked to complain that africa did not need more words , but action .
but as the university of leipzig 's engel says , koehler was able to consistently make a clear statement about the policies regarding africa .
" some politicians were clearly uncomfortable when he took a firm stand on issues that he felt the west needed to change .
a reduction of subsidies for western products for instance , or the need to take africa seriously , " engel said .
germany 's constitution did not give koehler much room to put his political ideas into practice .
according to the law , the president has little political power .
instead , he had to use the power of words to influence german politics , and that power was n't always enough .
“ it 's tragic that he did not manage to make politicians in berlin listen to him , " said engel .

the accusations are in connection with the hiring of a priest alleged to have been a sex offender in the 1980s . german prosecutors announced on wednesday that they were investigating claims that the head of the german bishops ' conference , robert zollitsch , aided and abetted a known sex offender in the church .
prosecutors said that they had received information indicating that , while zollitsch was in charge of the personnel department of a diocese in southern germany in 1987 , he appointed a priest who was known to have abused children .
the archdiocese of freiburg has released a statement denying that zollitsch was responsible for the appointment .
aiding and abetting prosecutors confirmed that they had launched an investigation , following reports by public broadcaster ard and the suedkurier newspaper .
the freiburg archdiocese has described the media reports as " absolutely weak " and " sensationalist . "
in 1987 zollitsch was head of the human resources department of the diocese of freiburg .
he is accused of rehiring a priest accused of sexually abusing children in a monestary in the 1960s .
the diocese says that the appointment was entirely in the hands of the monastery 's abbot , and that zollitsch neither knew of the original allegations nor the subsequent re-appointment .
part of a wider scandal sexual abuse scandals have rocked the church in germany since january , when dozens of cases emerged involving allegations of the sexual molestation of minors by priests and other clergy over a period of 50 years at catholic schools .
as head of the bishops ' conference , zollitsch has been at the forefront of the catholic church 's response to the ongoing reports of abuse .
he has often stated that the church needs to reform and " heal the wounds of victims . "
in his easter messages to his freiburg parishoners , he said the catholic church must examine its " dark aspects as well as our own shadowy sides .

the accusations are in connection with the hiring of a priest alleged to have been a sex offender in the 1980s . german prosecutors announced on wednesday that they were investigating claims that the head of the german bishops ' conference , robert zollitsch , aided and abetted a known sex offender in the church .
prosecutors said that they had received information indicating that , while zollitsch was in charge of the personnel department of a diocese in southern germany in 1987 , he appointed a priest who was known to have abused children .
the archdiocese of freiburg has released a statement denying that zollitsch was responsible for the appointment .
aiding and abetting prosecutors confirmed that they had launched an investigation , following reports by public broadcaster ard and the suedkurier newspaper .
the freiburg archdiocese has described the media reports as " absolutely weak " and " sensationalist . "
in 1987 zollitsch was head of the human resources department of the diocese of freiburg .
he is accused of rehiring a priest accused of sexually abusing children in a monestary in the 1960s .
the diocese says that the appointment was entirely in the hands of the monastery 's abbot , and that zollitsch neither knew of the original allegations nor the subsequent re-appointment .
part of a wider scandal sexual abuse scandals have rocked the church in germany since january , when dozens of cases emerged involving allegations of the sexual molestation of minors by priests and other clergy over a period of 50 years at catholic schools .
as head of the bishops ' conference , zollitsch has been at the forefront of the catholic church 's response to the ongoing reports of abuse .
he has often stated that the church needs to reform and " heal the wounds of victims . "
in his easter messages to his freiburg parishoners , he said the catholic church must examine its " dark aspects as well as our own shadowy sides .

when asked whether she would be interested in the job , von der leyen avoided any concrete statements of intent but there 's little doubt she has the confidence to take over from horst koehler .
" we now need to find a good solution for the country under extreme time pressure , " she said .
" i think it 's very important that the president enjoys a high level of trust from the people . "
von der leyen started her political career rather late but quickly rose through the party ranks .
it was not until 1990 that she joined the conservative christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
she first studied economics and later medicine before going on to work as a doctor and in research .
she entered local politics in 1991 and less than two years later was elected into the state parliament of lower saxony , where became minister for social affairs .
in 2005 chancellor angela merkel took her to berlin to become family minister .
modernizing family policies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : von der leyen was the driving force behind providing better child care herself a mother of seven , von der leyen played a crucial role in the cdu winning over new voters by modernizing the party 's all too conservative family policy .
she successfully fought for a modern , social familiy policy to give , for example , single mothers better career chances .
in 2009 , von der leyen became germany 's new labor minister after franz josef jung resigned .
her new post has seen her popularity undiminished as the german labor market seemed to withstand the expected downturn in the wake of the global economic crisis .
initial opinion polls suggest that von der leyen is the politician who can muster more popular support than any of the other possible successors to koehler .
40 percent of the population are in favor of a woman taking over the country 's most senior post , while 25 percent would like to see von der leyen herself take over .
the post of president is largely ceremonial in germany , and the incumbent usually abstains from commenting on party politics .
the president is however expected to act as a moral authority in wider national debates .
popular and political backing born in 1958 , von der leyen hails from a family with a longstanding tradition in politics .
her father was former state premier of lower saxony ernst albrecht , who also worked in brussels for the eu 's predecessor , the european community .
von der leyen spent the first few years of her life in belgium .

when asked whether she would be interested in the job , von der leyen avoided any concrete statements of intent but there 's little doubt she has the confidence to take over from horst koehler .
" we now need to find a good solution for the country under extreme time pressure , " she said .
" i think it 's very important that the president enjoys a high level of trust from the people . "
von der leyen started her political career rather late but quickly rose through the party ranks .
it was not until 1990 that she joined the conservative christian democrat party -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
she first studied economics and later medicine before going on to work as a doctor and in research .

she successfully fought for a modern , social familiy policy to give , for example , single mothers better career chances .
in 2009 , von der leyen became germany 's new labor minister after franz josef jung resigned .
her new post has seen her popularity undiminished as the german labor market seemed to withstand the expected downturn in the wake of the global economic crisis .
initial opinion polls suggest that von der leyen is the politician who can muster more popular support than any of the other possible successors to koehler .
40 percent of the population are in favor of a woman taking over the country 's most senior post , while 25 percent would like to see von der leyen herself take over .
the post of president is largely ceremonial in germany , and the incumbent usually abstains from commenting on party politics .
the president is however expected to act as a moral authority in wider national debates .
popular and political backing born in 1958 , von der leyen hails from a family with a longstanding tradition in politics .
her father was former state premier of lower saxony ernst albrecht , who also worked in brussels for the eu 's predecessor , the european community .
von der leyen spent the first few years of her life in belgium .

initial opinion polls suggest that von der leyen is the politician who can muster more popular support than any of the other possible successors to koehler .
40 percent of the population are in favor of a woman taking over the country 's most senior post , while 25 percent would like to see von der leyen herself take over .
the post of president is largely ceremonial in germany , and the incumbent usually abstains from commenting on party politics .
the president is however expected to act as a moral authority in wider national debates .
popular and political backing born in 1958 , von der leyen hails from a family with a longstanding tradition in politics .
her father was former state premier of lower saxony ernst albrecht , who also worked in brussels for the eu 's predecessor , the european community .
von der leyen spent the first few years of her life in belgium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the christian democrat would be germany 's first woman president her husband is a professor of medicine heiko von der leyen .
he counts among his ancestors a number of prince electors , who for centuries determined the succession of german emperors .
cross-party backing the leader of the opposition , social democrat sigmar gabriel , has called for all parties to be included in the talks on who should succeed koehler .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition however is expected to hold the majority in the federal convention , the body responsible for the selection of the next president .
merkel has indicated they would try to find someone who would be accepted across the political spectrum .
should berlin opt for ursula von der leyen , the government will likely have indeed picked a candidate that both the ruling coalition as well as many opposition politicians would support. ai / dpa / reuters / apn editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 02.06.2010 european commission plans reform of rating agency regulation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies are blamed for worsening the financial crisis credit rating agencies in the european union could soon be subject to new operating regulations , but some analysts fear that too much regulation will stifle competition in an sector already under a virtual oligopoly . the european commission on wednesday unveiled new proposals for regulating credit rating agencies -lrb- cras -rrb- , which some analysts blame for exacerbating the turmoil in european financial markets .
the new guidelines provide stricter transparency guidelines , and place cra regulation under the authority of the european securities and markets authority -lrb- esma -rrb- , which the commission established last year and is due to come into force at the start of 2011 .
the esma would have the authority to impose sanctions on agencies , and even withdraw their licenses when they fail to comply with regulations .
the three main credit rating agencies , standard & poor 's , moody 's and fitch , had operated with significant latitude before the eu began issuing licenses and demanding a certain level of transparency just last year , according to karel lannoo , director of the european credit research institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lowered bond ratings have made it hard for greece to finance its budget " when the financial crisis started in 2007 , it was very clear that the ratings which the rating agencies gave were not based on pure objective facts , " he told deutsche welle .
" there were huge conflicts of interest .
that 's why the eu was then convinced that there should be a piece of regulation . "
case for regulation one function of rating agencies is to rate the risk of government bonds , using a scale of aaa for the most secure to d for an almost certain default .
the agencies then sell these ratings to investors and banks .
the conflict of interest appears when the agencies rate the very institutions that buy their services , said robert halver , stock analyst for baader bank .
" the rating agencies finance themselves very strongly with the sale of analytical instruments on pension funds , insurance agencies and banks , because everyone assumes that they have a lot of knowledge about country 's risks , " he told deutsche welle .
another reason for further regulation is the role cras have played in crises related to the public finance of budgets , most notably in greece but also in spain , portugal and italy , said lannoo .
when ratings agencies devalue government bonds , it creates a problem of " systemic stability . "
" all of a sudden these ratings agencies have drastically downgraded the debt of these countries , which as given rise to systemic effects , in the sense that many investors have started to sell the securities or the bonds of these countries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker has proposed a new cra close to the european central bank more competition halver said one solution to europe 's problem with cras would be the creation of a european rating agency to compete with the " big three , " as long as it was n't under the supervision of a public entity like the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- or the european commission , as eurogroup president jean-claude juncker recently suggested .
" then there would be suspicion that they would exercise their influence and try to sugarcoat negative evaluations , " he said .
" that can not happen . "
lannoo said the big three already have a european component in fitch , whose main shareholder is european .
rather than constructing a new european rating agency , he said regulators should instead make it easier for already-existing agencies to be licensed as cras .
" what in fact we need to do is ... to lower the entry barriers into the sector , " he said .
" but what we in fact have done with this european regulation now is just the opposite - we have increased the entry thresholds because it 's extremely difficult to be in line with this piece of regulation . "

the new guidelines provide stricter transparency guidelines , and place cra regulation under the authority of the european securities and markets authority -lrb- esma -rrb- , which the commission established last year and is due to come into force at the start of 2011 .
the esma would have the authority to impose sanctions on agencies , and even withdraw their licenses when they fail to comply with regulations .
the three main credit rating agencies , standard & poor 's , moody 's and fitch , had operated with significant latitude before the eu began issuing licenses and demanding a certain level of transparency just last year , according to karel lannoo , director of the european credit research institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lowered bond ratings have made it hard for greece to finance its budget " when the financial crisis started in 2007 , it was very clear that the ratings which the rating agencies gave were not based on pure objective facts , " he told deutsche welle .
" there were huge conflicts of interest .
that 's why the eu was then convinced that there should be a piece of regulation . "
case for regulation one function of rating agencies is to rate the risk of government bonds , using a scale of aaa for the most secure to d for an almost certain default .
the agencies then sell these ratings to investors and banks .
the conflict of interest appears when the agencies rate the very institutions that buy their services , said robert halver , stock analyst for baader bank .
" the rating agencies finance themselves very strongly with the sale of analytical instruments on pension funds , insurance agencies and banks , because everyone assumes that they have a lot of knowledge about country 's risks , " he told deutsche welle .
another reason for further regulation is the role cras have played in crises related to the public finance of budgets , most notably in greece but also in spain , portugal and italy , said lannoo .
when ratings agencies devalue government bonds , it creates a problem of " systemic stability . "
" all of a sudden these ratings agencies have drastically downgraded the debt of these countries , which as given rise to systemic effects , in the sense that many investors have started to sell the securities or the bonds of these countries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker has proposed a new cra close to the european central bank more competition halver said one solution to europe 's problem with cras would be the creation of a european rating agency to compete with the " big three , " as long as it was n't under the supervision of a public entity like the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- or the european commission , as eurogroup president jean-claude juncker recently suggested .
" then there would be suspicion that they would exercise their influence and try to sugarcoat negative evaluations , " he said .
" that can not happen . "
lannoo said the big three already have a european component in fitch , whose main shareholder is european .
rather than constructing a new european rating agency , he said regulators should instead make it easier for already-existing agencies to be licensed as cras .
" what in fact we need to do is ... to lower the entry barriers into the sector , " he said .
" but what we in fact have done with this european regulation now is just the opposite - we have increased the entry thresholds because it 's extremely difficult to be in line with this piece of regulation . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 02.06.2010 european commission plans reform of rating agency regulation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rating agencies are blamed for worsening the financial crisis credit rating agencies in the european union could soon be subject to new operating regulations , but some analysts fear that too much regulation will stifle competition in an sector already under a virtual oligopoly . the european commission on wednesday unveiled new proposals for regulating credit rating agencies -lrb- cras -rrb- , which some analysts blame for exacerbating the turmoil in european financial markets .
the new guidelines provide stricter transparency guidelines , and place cra regulation under the authority of the european securities and markets authority -lrb- esma -rrb- , which the commission established last year and is due to come into force at the start of 2011 .
the esma would have the authority to impose sanctions on agencies , and even withdraw their licenses when they fail to comply with regulations .
the three main credit rating agencies , standard & poor 's , moody 's and fitch , had operated with significant latitude before the eu began issuing licenses and demanding a certain level of transparency just last year , according to karel lannoo , director of the european credit research institute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lowered bond ratings have made it hard for greece to finance its budget " when the financial crisis started in 2007 , it was very clear that the ratings which the rating agencies gave were not based on pure objective facts , " he told deutsche welle .
" there were huge conflicts of interest .
that 's why the eu was then convinced that there should be a piece of regulation . "
case for regulation one function of rating agencies is to rate the risk of government bonds , using a scale of aaa for the most secure to d for an almost certain default .
the agencies then sell these ratings to investors and banks .
the conflict of interest appears when the agencies rate the very institutions that buy their services , said robert halver , stock analyst for baader bank .
" the rating agencies finance themselves very strongly with the sale of analytical instruments on pension funds , insurance agencies and banks , because everyone assumes that they have a lot of knowledge about country 's risks , " he told deutsche welle .
another reason for further regulation is the role cras have played in crises related to the public finance of budgets , most notably in greece but also in spain , portugal and italy , said lannoo .
when ratings agencies devalue government bonds , it creates a problem of " systemic stability . "
" all of a sudden these ratings agencies have drastically downgraded the debt of these countries , which as given rise to systemic effects , in the sense that many investors have started to sell the securities or the bonds of these countries , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker has proposed a new cra close to the european central bank more competition halver said one solution to europe 's problem with cras would be the creation of a european rating agency to compete with the " big three , " as long as it was n't under the supervision of a public entity like the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- or the european commission , as eurogroup president jean-claude juncker recently suggested .
" then there would be suspicion that they would exercise their influence and try to sugarcoat negative evaluations , " he said .
" that can not happen . "
lannoo said the big three already have a european component in fitch , whose main shareholder is european .
rather than constructing a new european rating agency , he said regulators should instead make it easier for already-existing agencies to be licensed as cras .
" what in fact we need to do is ... to lower the entry barriers into the sector , " he said .
" but what we in fact have done with this european regulation now is just the opposite - we have increased the entry thresholds because it 's extremely difficult to be in line with this piece of regulation . "

some analysts are saying the next days will be crucial for its future . in an editorial , the website of german public broadcaster zdf said " the fate of this -lsb- government -rsb- coalition will be decided in the next ten days . "
that 's a drastic view , but there 's no doubt that the resignation of the german president , horst koehler , on monday has delivered a major blow to the government .
it has many important issues to be dealing with : the crisis in the eurozone , the need for drastic savings , or the military involvement in afghanistan , to mention just a few .
and the government coalition , made up of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , has a few crises of its own : the poor showing of the two parties in the indecisive regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the sudden resignation of powerful regional leader roland koch in hessen , the internal backbiting within the liberal party , and disastrous opinion poll ratings .
so the chancellor , angela merkel , could well do without the scramble to find a convincing new president within 30 days , as required by the constitution .
is it a crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she regretted koehler 's departure and had tried to change his mind in a major interview on the evening of koehler 's resignation , she insisted , " we have to be sure not to make a crisis out of every challenge . "
but peter stuetzle , head of deutsche welle 's berlin office , thinks that a crisis is exactly what this is .
" this has been one too much for the government , " he says .
" there 's been a lot of trouble , and the government was just about to try to leave all that behind , and in this minute , koehler resigns . "
if the current government were doing well , the resignation would just be a nuisance , but it 's a sign of the government 's problems that the nuisance was immediately seen as a crisis .

" what he , as a government supporter , fails to mention , is that , even if the people are disillusioned with all politicians , it 's his coalition which has the power to pilot the ship , and so that 's where the criticism hits particularly hard .
merkel has often been criticized for her lack of leadership - she tends to sit things out and wait until a consensus emerges - but the choice of a new president will require decisive action . peter stuetzle thinks the whole coalition has recognized the need .
her partners - not just the liberals , but also her bavarian sister-party , the csu - have agreed that they will do without their own candidates , and let her make the choice . " everything will be very fast , " he thinks , " and if it 's fast , and if it 's convincing too , then the government might even come out of the whole thing with a better public image at the end of the day .

some analysts are saying the next days will be crucial for its future . in an editorial , the website of german public broadcaster zdf said " the fate of this -lsb- government -rsb- coalition will be decided in the next ten days . "
that 's a drastic view , but there 's no doubt that the resignation of the german president , horst koehler , on monday has delivered a major blow to the government .
it has many important issues to be dealing with : the crisis in the eurozone , the need for drastic savings , or the military involvement in afghanistan , to mention just a few .
and the government coalition , made up of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , has a few crises of its own : the poor showing of the two parties in the indecisive regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , the sudden resignation of powerful regional leader roland koch in hessen , the internal backbiting within the liberal party , and disastrous opinion poll ratings .
so the chancellor , angela merkel , could well do without the scramble to find a convincing new president within 30 days , as required by the constitution .
is it a crisis ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she regretted koehler 's departure and had tried to change his mind in a major interview on the evening of koehler 's resignation , she insisted , " we have to be sure not to make a crisis out of every challenge . "
but peter stuetzle , head of deutsche welle 's berlin office , thinks that a crisis is exactly what this is .
" this has been one too much for the government , " he says .
" there 's been a lot of trouble , and the government was just about to try to leave all that behind , and in this minute , koehler resigns . "
if the current government were doing well , the resignation would just be a nuisance , but it 's a sign of the government 's problems that the nuisance was immediately seen as a crisis .

" what he , as a government supporter , fails to mention , is that , even if the people are disillusioned with all politicians , it 's his coalition which has the power to pilot the ship , and so that 's where the criticism hits particularly hard .

swedish foreign minister carl bildt was among the european leaders in sarajevo lending his support to some balkan nations bidding to join the eu .
" there are a number of countries where enthusiasm for enlargement is less than 100 percent these days .
then it is important that we come here to reaffirm and say ... the door is open , " bildt said .
of the nations that emerged from the violent collapse of yugoslavia in the 1990s , slovenia has already joined the eu , croatia is close to membership and serbia , montenegro and macedonia have applied .
to the south , albania has also applied .
bosnia , which remains an international protectorate divided along ethnic lines , and kosovo , whose independence serbia and some eu states do not recognise , are lagging behind .
balkans welcome in light of the ongoing debt crisis in europe , there was some concern in the balkans that progress would be bogged down on absorbing new nations into the block .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu foreign affairs chief catherine ashton with bosnia -lrb- r -rrb- and spain -lrb- l -rrb- foreign ministers at the meeting but bildt added that he expected " strong reaffirmation by the eu " encouraging the balkan nations to push on with their efforts to join the eu .
spain , who currently holds the rotating eu presidency and organized the meeting , added that balkan countries were welcome in the eu " a very good future for the whole region , a european future , and a commitment of the international community to support all western balkans to join the eu , that is the main message today , " said spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos .
however , many balkan states will be hoping more than rhetoric comes out of the meeting .
this could come in the form of extending the right to travel without visas in the eu 's schengen zone to bosnia and albania , an idea put forth in brussels last week .
this right has already been given to serbia , montenegro and macedonia .
conference downgraded the sarajevo conference was originally planned as a summit , but reconfigured as informal talks because of the current row between serbia and its former province kosovo .
belgrade refuses to acknowledge kosovo , which declared independence from serbia in 2008 , and serbian officials insist they will not formally share any table with their kosovo counterparts . because the conference has revised its format , it will now not issue any formal declaration at the end of proceedings. mz / cb / dpa / reuters / afp editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 02.06.2010 with cinema jenin , a dream is fulfilled for palestinian youth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the restoration was driven by the parents of ahmed khatib german filmmaker marcus vetter is close to completing the restoration of a cinema in jenin , a town in the palestinian west bank .
the cinema was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago . marcus vetter made a film in jenin three years ago - and stayed on to build a cinema in which to show it .
his documentary film , " the heart of jenin , " is about ahmed khatib , a palestinian boy killed by israeli troops while playing with a toy gun in the town 's refugee camp .
his parents decided to donate their son 's organs to save the lives of other children - arab and israeli .
the documentary won several awards , but it could n't be shown in jenin , where it all happened .
the town 's only movie theater was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago .
ahmed 's parents asked vetter to help renovate and reopen it , because they wanted to create more opportunities for local children .
he agreed , although he 'd never funded or managed a building project before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcus vetter with one of the palestinian teens who 's been helping on the project " you ca n't open such a place just by helping .
it 's impossible as i realized very fast .
this is real work .
what i could have helped with was fundraising , but raising money is nothing - raising money just means corruption , " said vetter .
vetter has run things in an unorthodox way .
he did n't apply for funding before starting .
he just began , with no salaries at all to pay the german architects and engineers .
they 're volunteers .
" just take a step , that 's what we did here , just renovate , do n't talk all the time , and do it with all your passion , " said vetter .
the project is ambitious .
vetter and his team are renovating the old indoor cinema , building an outdoor one , adding a cafe and guest house , as well as setting up a film production and distribution company .
government , private donors covered costs so far , the project has cost more than half a million euros .
most of the money has come from the german government , with the rest from corporate donors and ordinary people .
along the way , money has always been tight .
earlier this year , vetter simply ran out of cash .
he wrote to six donors saying he needed 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- to finish the job .
only one of them replied - legendary british musician roger waters , of pink floyd fame .
" having met all the people involved i felt connected to them and i felt it was the least i could do to give them the money to finish the project , " said waters , talking by phone from the united states .
waters says he was inspired to help by the generosity of ahmed khatib 's father .

his documentary film , " the heart of jenin , " is about ahmed khatib , a palestinian boy killed by israeli troops while playing with a toy gun in the town 's refugee camp .
his parents decided to donate their son 's organs to save the lives of other children - arab and israeli .
the documentary won several awards , but it could n't be shown in jenin , where it all happened .

the cinema was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago . marcus vetter made a film in jenin three years ago - and stayed on to build a cinema in which to show it .
his documentary film , " the heart of jenin , " is about ahmed khatib , a palestinian boy killed by israeli troops while playing with a toy gun in the town 's refugee camp .
his parents decided to donate their son 's organs to save the lives of other children - arab and israeli .
the documentary won several awards , but it could n't be shown in jenin , where it all happened .
the town 's only movie theater was shut down by palestinian militants more than two decades ago .
ahmed 's parents asked vetter to help renovate and reopen it , because they wanted to create more opportunities for local children .
he agreed , although he 'd never funded or managed a building project before .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcus vetter with one of the palestinian teens who 's been helping on the project " you ca n't open such a place just by helping .
it 's impossible as i realized very fast .
this is real work .
what i could have helped with was fundraising , but raising money is nothing - raising money just means corruption , " said vetter .
vetter has run things in an unorthodox way .
he did n't apply for funding before starting .
he just began , with no salaries at all to pay the german architects and engineers .
they 're volunteers .
" just take a step , that 's what we did here , just renovate , do n't talk all the time , and do it with all your passion , " said vetter .
the project is ambitious .
vetter and his team are renovating the old indoor cinema , building an outdoor one , adding a cafe and guest house , as well as setting up a film production and distribution company .
government , private donors covered costs so far , the project has cost more than half a million euros .
most of the money has come from the german government , with the rest from corporate donors and ordinary people .
along the way , money has always been tight .
earlier this year , vetter simply ran out of cash .
he wrote to six donors saying he needed 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 108,000 -rrb- to finish the job .
only one of them replied - legendary british musician roger waters , of pink floyd fame .
" having met all the people involved i felt connected to them and i felt it was the least i could do to give them the money to finish the project , " said waters , talking by phone from the united states .
waters says he was inspired to help by the generosity of ahmed khatib 's father .
" this project was fundamentally and always attached to that story , that incredibly moving story .
he gives the rest of us hope that we may at some point find a partial solution to the plight the palestinian people find themselves in , " said waters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a truck delivers all the technical equipment to the cinema dialogue with other cultures fakhri hamad , the project manager for cinema jenin , says the project is changing the town .
" we started with a small idea to have a place for kids to play and learn but it 's had local and international support , and it 's grown and grown .
now it 's become a project of the town itself .
jenin has the chance to prove it 's ready to accept other cultures , to accept peace and to accept dialogue , " said hamad .
it 's been a huge turnaround for jenin , a town with a population of around 250,000 which became known as the source of a third of the suicide bombers of the palestinian uprising known as the second intifada .
now , young palestinians are learning about filmmaking side by side with german students , as well as working on the building site together .
opposition from intellectuals but there has been some palestinian opposition to the project .
earlier this year , palestinian intellectuals criticized cinema jenin , arguing that it " normalized " relations between palestinians and israel .
they said the project relied on cooperation with israel and that they opposed building a cinema while israel 's occupation army remained in the west bank .
vetter admits that he was discouraged .
" i did think then that the project might fail .
i thought that i ca n't keep giving my time to a project which has a fundamentalist approach .
it was very depressing , " said vetter bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's still a long way to go on the building site but the faith of ordinary people in the project restored vetter 's commitment , as did the unswerving determination of ahmed khatib 's parents .
for them , cinema jenin is the fulfilment of a dream .
they want the town 's young people to have more of everything than their son had - more opportunities , more of a future , and of course more security .
when he died , ahmed saved the lives of the five children who received his organs .
with this movie theater , established in his memory , they hope he will touch the lives of countless more .
opening in time for world cup cinema jenin is now almost complete .
the members of the project team hope to open the outdoor cinema in time for the world cup later this month .
the official opening of the restored indoor cinema is scheduled for august .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 02.06.2010 turkey and us face tough decisions on relations after israeli flotilla raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as turkey 's relations with israel dive , ankara looks to the us while its relations with israel continue to plummet to new depths in the wake of the gaza flotilla raid , turkey is considering how to handle the us as washington tries to balance its ties with jerusalem and ankara . few countries are more enraged by israel 's raid on the gaza aid flotilla than turkey .
much of the action during monday 's pre-dawn raid by israeli commandos was focused on a turkish-flagged ship and at least four of the nine fatalities arising from the attack were pro-palestinian turks . in the days following , relations between turkey and israel have been strained to breaking point with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan calling the raid a " bloody massacre " and accusing israel of " unacceptable lawlessness . " erdogan has even gone so far as to refer to israel - a close partner since diplomatic ties with the jewish state were established in 1949 - as " a festering boil in the middle east that spreads hate and enmity , dynamites regional peace and spreads instability . " in such a situation , it is unsurprising that relations between turkey and israel are currently plummeting to an all-time low , even lower than when the relationship soured over israel 's military operations in gaza in 2008 .
but experts are also watching closely how relations between turkey and israel 's most powerful ally – the united states – will develop as the shockwaves from the flotilla raid ripple on . a furious erdogan wasted no time calling us president barack obama after the incident . " israel is faced with the danger of losing its sole friend in the region and the greatest contributor so far to regional peace , " erdogan told the us president in a one-hour telephone conversation , according to a turkish government statement on wednesday . bildunterschrift : erdogan suggested that turkey could abandon israel but trade and military ties remain too strong turkey-israel ties ' too strong to break ' turkey has been israel 's chief regional ally since a military cooperation deal was signed between the two countries in 1996 .
however , some sections of the us media claim the implication behind erdogan 's statement is that turkey , with its mainly muslim population , could shift its allegiance towards its new-found friends in the arab world , partners which the islamist-rooted government in ankara have been courting for some time . joost lagendijk , a senior advisor at the istanbul policy center , disagrees .
he believes that the connections between turkey and israel are too strong to be severed . " while we will see the two sides divided at an official , political level , turkey and israel will still have strong military and business ties , " he told deutsche welle . " it makes good sense to have good relations with the arabs but rejecting israel for the arabs is not a viable alternative . " while relations – especially those concerning trade – have been improving over the past few years with a host of arab nations , including syria , iran , lebanon and jordan , turkey still has its eyes set on europe and eu membership .
the european union is still the main power that turkey trusts most in the international arena , despite the eu 's continued ambivalence towards ankara 's accession hopes . however , some observers claim that the israeli raid offers turkey an opportunity to dangle the possibility of an eastward shift in the face of the united states to gain some leverage in a number of issues .
joost lagendijk believes it would be foolish to do so . " turkey 's standing in the middle east and its dealing with its arab partners are only possible because it has such good connections with both the us and the eu , ” he said .
“ that 's what makes turkey such an interesting partner to the arabs .
what would the value of turkey be without that ? " steven cook , a middle east expert at the council on foreign relations , believes turkey will pursue its own goals in the middle east and wo n't feel the need to pressure the us into supporting it . " turkey has economic , political and strategic interests in the arab middle east and turkish leaders obviously feel less inhibited to pursue their own interests in the region , regardless of washington 's wishes , " he told deutsche welle .
" the turks are willing to bend the regional rules of the game to serve ankara 's own interests .
if the resulting policies serve us goals at the same time , all well and good .
if not , so be it . " the united states may be closely watching turkey 's growing connection to regional arab powers but is unlikely to feel any threat from its closer ties with the likes of iran and syria .
despite its ambitions , turkey 's current economic and strategic power is still not enough to project discernible influence in the middle east and it still requires good relations with the us and eu to add weight to its status in the region . us looking to keep muslim ally turkey on side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain good relations with turkey bilateral relations by their nature have mutual benefits and turkey is n't the only partner seeking support .
the united states sees turkey as a key muslim ally and the obama administration has been working hard to repair the damage to relations caused by the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion . since then , the us and turkey have set-up intelligence sharing networks in the on-going fight against international terrorism while turkey hosts the us military infrastructure needed for its missions in neighbouring iraq and afghanistan . " turkey is still a key muslim ally to the us and is a favorite partner , one which is held up as an example of a predominantly islamic country with a growing democracy , " joost lagendijk said .
" the us wo n't want to jeapordise that .
if it turns on turkey for any reason , then the whole rhetoric washington has created about reforming the islamic world will crumble . " despite this , steven cook says , the two nations are increasingly finding themselves at odds with each other . " washington and ankara do share the same goals : peace between israel and the palestinians ; a stable , unified iraq ; an iran without nuclear weapons ; stability in afghanistan ; and a western-oriented syria , " he said . " when you get down to details , however , washington and ankara are on the opposite ends of virtually all these issues . " but after six decades of strategic cooperation , the stark reality is that while turkey and the united states are not enemies in the middle east , they are fast becoming strategic competitors . " turkey is asserting itself more in the middle east , where it has gone from a tepid observer to an influential player in eight short years , " cook added . washington faces balancing act with ankara , jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ties with israel will impact on its relations with turkey while turkey and the united states will not want to fall out , the situation arising from the israeli flotilla raid may still give turkey an opportunity to press its own agenda while maintaining strong ties with the us .
as pressure from the international community grows , turkey currently stands a greater chance at getting its own way over ending the blockade of gaza " the world has woken up to the gaza situation and now it is not only turkey calling for the end of the blockade , ” lagendijk said .
“ turkey , if it is clever , can use this to pressure the us which itself is growing more frustrated with the netanyahu government in israel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 02.06.2010 turkey and us face tough decisions on relations after israeli flotilla raid großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as turkey 's relations with israel dive , ankara looks to the us while its relations with israel continue to plummet to new depths in the wake of the gaza flotilla raid , turkey is considering how to handle the us as washington tries to balance its ties with jerusalem and ankara . few countries are more enraged by israel 's raid on the gaza aid flotilla than turkey .
much of the action during monday 's pre-dawn raid by israeli commandos was focused on a turkish-flagged ship and at least four of the nine fatalities arising from the attack were pro-palestinian turks . in the days following , relations between turkey and israel have been strained to breaking point with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan calling the raid a " bloody massacre " and accusing israel of " unacceptable lawlessness . " erdogan has even gone so far as to refer to israel - a close partner since diplomatic ties with the jewish state were established in 1949 - as " a festering boil in the middle east that spreads hate and enmity , dynamites regional peace and spreads instability . " in such a situation , it is unsurprising that relations between turkey and israel are currently plummeting to an all-time low , even lower than when the relationship soured over israel 's military operations in gaza in 2008 .
but experts are also watching closely how relations between turkey and israel 's most powerful ally – the united states – will develop as the shockwaves from the flotilla raid ripple on . a furious erdogan wasted no time calling us president barack obama after the incident . " israel is faced with the danger of losing its sole friend in the region and the greatest contributor so far to regional peace , " erdogan told the us president in a one-hour telephone conversation , according to a turkish government statement on wednesday . bildunterschrift : erdogan suggested that turkey could abandon israel but trade and military ties remain too strong turkey-israel ties ' too strong to break ' turkey has been israel 's chief regional ally since a military cooperation deal was signed between the two countries in 1996 .
however , some sections of the us media claim the implication behind erdogan 's statement is that turkey , with its mainly muslim population , could shift its allegiance towards its new-found friends in the arab world , partners which the islamist-rooted government in ankara have been courting for some time . joost lagendijk , a senior advisor at the istanbul policy center , disagrees .
he believes that the connections between turkey and israel are too strong to be severed . " while we will see the two sides divided at an official , political level , turkey and israel will still have strong military and business ties , " he told deutsche welle . " it makes good sense to have good relations with the arabs but rejecting israel for the arabs is not a viable alternative . " while relations – especially those concerning trade – have been improving over the past few years with a host of arab nations , including syria , iran , lebanon and jordan , turkey still has its eyes set on europe and eu membership .
the european union is still the main power that turkey trusts most in the international arena , despite the eu 's continued ambivalence towards ankara 's accession hopes . however , some observers claim that the israeli raid offers turkey an opportunity to dangle the possibility of an eastward shift in the face of the united states to gain some leverage in a number of issues .
joost lagendijk believes it would be foolish to do so . " turkey 's standing in the middle east and its dealing with its arab partners are only possible because it has such good connections with both the us and the eu , ” he said .
“ that 's what makes turkey such an interesting partner to the arabs .
what would the value of turkey be without that ? " steven cook , a middle east expert at the council on foreign relations , believes turkey will pursue its own goals in the middle east and wo n't feel the need to pressure the us into supporting it . " turkey has economic , political and strategic interests in the arab middle east and turkish leaders obviously feel less inhibited to pursue their own interests in the region , regardless of washington 's wishes , " he told deutsche welle .
" the turks are willing to bend the regional rules of the game to serve ankara 's own interests .
if the resulting policies serve us goals at the same time , all well and good .
if not , so be it . " the united states may be closely watching turkey 's growing connection to regional arab powers but is unlikely to feel any threat from its closer ties with the likes of iran and syria .
despite its ambitions , turkey 's current economic and strategic power is still not enough to project discernible influence in the middle east and it still requires good relations with the us and eu to add weight to its status in the region . us looking to keep muslim ally turkey on side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain good relations with turkey bilateral relations by their nature have mutual benefits and turkey is n't the only partner seeking support .
the united states sees turkey as a key muslim ally and the obama administration has been working hard to repair the damage to relations caused by the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion . since then , the us and turkey have set-up intelligence sharing networks in the on-going fight against international terrorism while turkey hosts the us military infrastructure needed for its missions in neighbouring iraq and afghanistan . " turkey is still a key muslim ally to the us and is a favorite partner , one which is held up as an example of a predominantly islamic country with a growing democracy , " joost lagendijk said .
" the us wo n't want to jeapordise that .
if it turns on turkey for any reason , then the whole rhetoric washington has created about reforming the islamic world will crumble . " despite this , steven cook says , the two nations are increasingly finding themselves at odds with each other . " washington and ankara do share the same goals : peace between israel and the palestinians ; a stable , unified iraq ; an iran without nuclear weapons ; stability in afghanistan ; and a western-oriented syria , " he said . " when you get down to details , however , washington and ankara are on the opposite ends of virtually all these issues . " but after six decades of strategic cooperation , the stark reality is that while turkey and the united states are not enemies in the middle east , they are fast becoming strategic competitors . " turkey is asserting itself more in the middle east , where it has gone from a tepid observer to an influential player in eight short years , " cook added . washington faces balancing act with ankara , jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ties with israel will impact on its relations with turkey while turkey and the united states will not want to fall out , the situation arising from the israeli flotilla raid may still give turkey an opportunity to press its own agenda while maintaining strong ties with the us .
as pressure from the international community grows , turkey currently stands a greater chance at getting its own way over ending the blockade of gaza " the world has woken up to the gaza situation and now it is not only turkey calling for the end of the blockade , ” lagendijk said .
“ turkey , if it is clever , can use this to pressure the us which itself is growing more frustrated with the netanyahu government in israel .

much of the action during monday 's pre-dawn raid by israeli commandos was focused on a turkish-flagged ship and at least four of the nine fatalities arising from the attack were pro-palestinian turks . in the days following , relations between turkey and israel have been strained to breaking point with turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan calling the raid a " bloody massacre " and accusing israel of " unacceptable lawlessness . " erdogan has even gone so far as to refer to israel - a close partner since diplomatic ties with the jewish state were established in 1949 - as " a festering boil in the middle east that spreads hate and enmity , dynamites regional peace and spreads instability . " in such a situation , it is unsurprising that relations between turkey and israel are currently plummeting to an all-time low , even lower than when the relationship soured over israel 's military operations in gaza in 2008 .
but experts are also watching closely how relations between turkey and israel 's most powerful ally – the united states – will develop as the shockwaves from the flotilla raid ripple on . a furious erdogan wasted no time calling us president barack obama after the incident . " israel is faced with the danger of losing its sole friend in the region and the greatest contributor so far to regional peace , " erdogan told the us president in a one-hour telephone conversation , according to a turkish government statement on wednesday . bildunterschrift : erdogan suggested that turkey could abandon israel but trade and military ties remain too strong turkey-israel ties ' too strong to break ' turkey has been israel 's chief regional ally since a military cooperation deal was signed between the two countries in 1996 .
however , some sections of the us media claim the implication behind erdogan 's statement is that turkey , with its mainly muslim population , could shift its allegiance towards its new-found friends in the arab world , partners which the islamist-rooted government in ankara have been courting for some time . joost lagendijk , a senior advisor at the istanbul policy center , disagrees .
he believes that the connections between turkey and israel are too strong to be severed . " while we will see the two sides divided at an official , political level , turkey and israel will still have strong military and business ties , " he told deutsche welle . " it makes good sense to have good relations with the arabs but rejecting israel for the arabs is not a viable alternative . " while relations – especially those concerning trade – have been improving over the past few years with a host of arab nations , including syria , iran , lebanon and jordan , turkey still has its eyes set on europe and eu membership .
the european union is still the main power that turkey trusts most in the international arena , despite the eu 's continued ambivalence towards ankara 's accession hopes . however , some observers claim that the israeli raid offers turkey an opportunity to dangle the possibility of an eastward shift in the face of the united states to gain some leverage in a number of issues .
joost lagendijk believes it would be foolish to do so . " turkey 's standing in the middle east and its dealing with its arab partners are only possible because it has such good connections with both the us and the eu , ” he said .
“ that 's what makes turkey such an interesting partner to the arabs .
what would the value of turkey be without that ? " steven cook , a middle east expert at the council on foreign relations , believes turkey will pursue its own goals in the middle east and wo n't feel the need to pressure the us into supporting it . " turkey has economic , political and strategic interests in the arab middle east and turkish leaders obviously feel less inhibited to pursue their own interests in the region , regardless of washington 's wishes , " he told deutsche welle .
" the turks are willing to bend the regional rules of the game to serve ankara 's own interests .
if the resulting policies serve us goals at the same time , all well and good .
if not , so be it . " the united states may be closely watching turkey 's growing connection to regional arab powers but is unlikely to feel any threat from its closer ties with the likes of iran and syria .
despite its ambitions , turkey 's current economic and strategic power is still not enough to project discernible influence in the middle east and it still requires good relations with the us and eu to add weight to its status in the region . us looking to keep muslim ally turkey on side bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to maintain good relations with turkey bilateral relations by their nature have mutual benefits and turkey is n't the only partner seeking support .
the united states sees turkey as a key muslim ally and the obama administration has been working hard to repair the damage to relations caused by the 2003 us-led invasion of iraq .
turkey had refused at the time to allow the us to use its territory as a staging ground for invasion . since then , the us and turkey have set-up intelligence sharing networks in the on-going fight against international terrorism while turkey hosts the us military infrastructure needed for its missions in neighbouring iraq and afghanistan . " turkey is still a key muslim ally to the us and is a favorite partner , one which is held up as an example of a predominantly islamic country with a growing democracy , " joost lagendijk said .
" the us wo n't want to jeapordise that .
if it turns on turkey for any reason , then the whole rhetoric washington has created about reforming the islamic world will crumble . " despite this , steven cook says , the two nations are increasingly finding themselves at odds with each other . " washington and ankara do share the same goals : peace between israel and the palestinians ; a stable , unified iraq ; an iran without nuclear weapons ; stability in afghanistan ; and a western-oriented syria , " he said . " when you get down to details , however , washington and ankara are on the opposite ends of virtually all these issues . " but after six decades of strategic cooperation , the stark reality is that while turkey and the united states are not enemies in the middle east , they are fast becoming strategic competitors . " turkey is asserting itself more in the middle east , where it has gone from a tepid observer to an influential player in eight short years , " cook added . washington faces balancing act with ankara , jerusalem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us ties with israel will impact on its relations with turkey while turkey and the united states will not want to fall out , the situation arising from the israeli flotilla raid may still give turkey an opportunity to press its own agenda while maintaining strong ties with the us .
as pressure from the international community grows , turkey currently stands a greater chance at getting its own way over ending the blockade of gaza " the world has woken up to the gaza situation and now it is not only turkey calling for the end of the blockade , ” lagendijk said .
“ turkey , if it is clever , can use this to pressure the us which itself is growing more frustrated with the netanyahu government in israel .
maybe this will lead to the us calling for an end to the embargo . " author : nick amies editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ban " concerns securities that registered on a regulated german market , " a finance ministry said .
the ban also encompasses certain trades on currencies that are not used for hedging purposes .
a previous version of the draft law had envisaged a complete ban on short selling currency derivates .
naked short is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
but unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy them back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether .
it is viewed as a far riskier form of trading .
the practice came under fire after greece struggled to raise capital to finance its debt .
naked trades were blamed for artificially inflating the country 's funding costs .
last month , germany stunned its international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide with its plan to temporarily ban naked short selling of some financial shares , sovereign debt bonds and credit default swaps .
after berlin announced its ban last month , christoph schmidt , head of germany 's rwi economics institute , referred to the move as " an isolated step in a globalized world " and doubted it would have an impact .
indeed , most short selling takes place in london ; it is not a common practice in germany .
the draft bill must still be approved by the lower house of german parliament , the bundestag , where chancellor merkel 's coalition government holds a majority .
the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , can delay the bill but not block it indefinitely .

the ban " concerns securities that registered on a regulated german market , " a finance ministry said .
the ban also encompasses certain trades on currencies that are not used for hedging purposes .
a previous version of the draft law had envisaged a complete ban on short selling currency derivates .
naked short is effectively a bet that a certain stock or government bond will lose value .
but unlike conventional short selling whereby traders borrow securities to sell and buy them back at a profit once their price has fallen , naked short selling leapfrogs the borrowing process altogether .
it is viewed as a far riskier form of trading .
the practice came under fire after greece struggled to raise capital to finance its debt .
naked trades were blamed for artificially inflating the country 's funding costs .
last month , germany stunned its international partners and roiled financial markets worldwide with its plan to temporarily ban naked short selling of some financial shares , sovereign debt bonds and credit default swaps .
after berlin announced its ban last month , christoph schmidt , head of germany 's rwi economics institute , referred to the move as " an isolated step in a globalized world " and doubted it would have an impact .
indeed , most short selling takes place in london ; it is not a common practice in germany .
the draft bill must still be approved by the lower house of german parliament , the bundestag , where chancellor merkel 's coalition government holds a majority .
the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , can delay the bill but not block it indefinitely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 02.06.2010 irascible german literary critic reich-ranicki turns 90 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki had an idea early on of a new style of literary criticism marcel reich-ranicki is germany 's best known literary critic .
his long career and definitive pronouncements have earned him the irreverent nickname " the pope of german letters . "
on june 2 , he turns 90 . marcel reich-ranicki was in charge of the literature section of the national newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in the 1970s , and hosted the television book discussion program " literary quartet " throughout the 1990 's .
these and many other public appearances where he freely made his pronouncements on german books and writing have made him one of germany 's best-known cultural critics .
reich-ranicki , who is celebrating his 90th birthday on june 2 , is also one of just a handful of jewish public figures in germany to resettle in the country after having survived world war ii .
born in 1920 in wloclawek , poland , the future critic attended high school in berlin .
because he was jewish , he was denied entry to the university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the critic , just ending his ninth decade , is still up for an argument after being deported to poland , reich-ranicki was able to flee the warsaw ghetto with his wife , tosia .
in 1958 , he returned to germany and dedicated himself to the study of german language and literature - and saw an opening for himself in the world of german letters .
risky career move " when i came to germany in ' 58 , and i saw what people were writing about literature in the -lsb- newspapers here , -rsb- i told my wife : i want to do an experiment , " reich-ranicki said in an acceptance speech after receiving the north rhine-westphalia state prize in 2005 .
" these people write so confusingly , so cryptically , i just do n't like their criticism , " he continued .
" i will say loud and clear what i think about books .
it is risky , and two things could happen : i will either rise to the top of the literary criticism hierarchy , or sink to the very bottom .
but i have to try . "
reich-ranicki has remained incorruptible and sharp in his opinions , and he does n't mince words .
that attitude has cost him a few friends over the years .
his dedication to speaking the truth as he sees it was behind a major uproar in 2008 , when he was invited to receive an honorary german television prize for his cultural contributions .
as recipients awaiting awards usually do , he sat passively in the audience as one tv personality after another came up to make a speech , accept an award , or tell a few jokes .
critic who speaks his mind he was definitely not impressed with what he saw - and he made no secret of his feelings .
when the time came for him to accept his honorary award , he stunned viewers by rejecting it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel awarded reich-ranicki the henri-nannen prize in 2008 " i can not accept this prize , " reich-ranicki told the shocked audience .
" i did n't know what to expect here , and i think it is awful that i had to sit through this for so many hours . "
at first , some of the guests at the ceremony thought reich-ranicki was joking .
but in this case he was simply telling it like he saw it - live and on the air .
by giving an open , radical critique of what he saw as the poor state of german television , reich-ranicki underlined his reputation as something of a crank , not to mention a " hard taskmaster " and a " a specialist in executions , " as different critics have put it .
reich-ranicki answers his detractors by saying that indeed , his first and foremost job is to be tough and critical .
years on ' literary quartet ' " being called an ' execution specialist ' is really nonsense , " reich-ranicki told broadcaster wdr in a 1986 interview .
" but i try to be clear in my criticism .
and the clarity of criticism , well , that is a question of politesse .
you have to be polite to the readers .
and that means being clear and explicit with your meaning , not hiding behind ambiguous or enigmatic phrases . "
his appearances as the head critic on television 's " literary quartet " between 1988 and 2001 brought reich-ranicki to the small screen some 77 times - automatically launching him to the top of germany 's lit-crit pop cultural heap .

his long career and definitive pronouncements have earned him the irreverent nickname " the pope of german letters . "
on june 2 , he turns 90 . marcel reich-ranicki was in charge of the literature section of the national newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in the 1970s , and hosted the television book discussion program " literary quartet " throughout the 1990 's .
these and many other public appearances where he freely made his pronouncements on german books and writing have made him one of germany 's best-known cultural critics .
reich-ranicki , who is celebrating his 90th birthday on june 2 , is also one of just a handful of jewish public figures in germany to resettle in the country after having survived world war ii .
born in 1920 in wloclawek , poland , the future critic attended high school in berlin .
because he was jewish , he was denied entry to the university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the critic , just ending his ninth decade , is still up for an argument after being deported to poland , reich-ranicki was able to flee the warsaw ghetto with his wife , tosia .
in 1958 , he returned to germany and dedicated himself to the study of german language and literature - and saw an opening for himself in the world of german letters .
risky career move " when i came to germany in ' 58 , and i saw what people were writing about literature in the -lsb- newspapers here , -rsb- i told my wife : i want to do an experiment , " reich-ranicki said in an acceptance speech after receiving the north rhine-westphalia state prize in 2005 .
" these people write so confusingly , so cryptically , i just do n't like their criticism , " he continued .
" i will say loud and clear what i think about books .
it is risky , and two things could happen : i will either rise to the top of the literary criticism hierarchy , or sink to the very bottom .
but i have to try . "
reich-ranicki has remained incorruptible and sharp in his opinions , and he does n't mince words .
that attitude has cost him a few friends over the years .
his dedication to speaking the truth as he sees it was behind a major uproar in 2008 , when he was invited to receive an honorary german television prize for his cultural contributions .
as recipients awaiting awards usually do , he sat passively in the audience as one tv personality after another came up to make a speech , accept an award , or tell a few jokes .
critic who speaks his mind he was definitely not impressed with what he saw - and he made no secret of his feelings .
when the time came for him to accept his honorary award , he stunned viewers by rejecting it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel awarded reich-ranicki the henri-nannen prize in 2008 " i can not accept this prize , " reich-ranicki told the shocked audience .
" i did n't know what to expect here , and i think it is awful that i had to sit through this for so many hours . "
at first , some of the guests at the ceremony thought reich-ranicki was joking .
but in this case he was simply telling it like he saw it - live and on the air .
by giving an open , radical critique of what he saw as the poor state of german television , reich-ranicki underlined his reputation as something of a crank , not to mention a " hard taskmaster " and a " a specialist in executions , " as different critics have put it .
reich-ranicki answers his detractors by saying that indeed , his first and foremost job is to be tough and critical .
years on ' literary quartet ' " being called an ' execution specialist ' is really nonsense , " reich-ranicki told broadcaster wdr in a 1986 interview .
" but i try to be clear in my criticism .
and the clarity of criticism , well , that is a question of politesse .
you have to be polite to the readers .
and that means being clear and explicit with your meaning , not hiding behind ambiguous or enigmatic phrases . "
his appearances as the head critic on television 's " literary quartet " between 1988 and 2001 brought reich-ranicki to the small screen some 77 times - automatically launching him to the top of germany 's lit-crit pop cultural heap .
despite his fame , however , he certainly is n't infallible .
and if he had a reputation for judging literature based more on his personal reading preferences than on serious criticism , well , that did n't stop his opinion from making and breaking many a literary career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his 2008 rejection of the german tv prize came as a shock those who raised his wrath - peter handke , guenter grass or martin walser , for example - had to fight their way into the market .

his long career and definitive pronouncements have earned him the irreverent nickname " the pope of german letters . "
on june 2 , he turns 90 . marcel reich-ranicki was in charge of the literature section of the national newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in the 1970s , and hosted the television book discussion program " literary quartet " throughout the 1990 's .
these and many other public appearances where he freely made his pronouncements on german books and writing have made him one of germany 's best-known cultural critics .
reich-ranicki , who is celebrating his 90th birthday on june 2 , is also one of just a handful of jewish public figures in germany to resettle in the country after having survived world war ii .
born in 1920 in wloclawek , poland , the future critic attended high school in berlin .
because he was jewish , he was denied entry to the university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the critic , just ending his ninth decade , is still up for an argument after being deported to poland , reich-ranicki was able to flee the warsaw ghetto with his wife , tosia .
in 1958 , he returned to germany and dedicated himself to the study of german language and literature - and saw an opening for himself in the world of german letters .
risky career move " when i came to germany in ' 58 , and i saw what people were writing about literature in the -lsb- newspapers here , -rsb- i told my wife : i want to do an experiment , " reich-ranicki said in an acceptance speech after receiving the north rhine-westphalia state prize in 2005 .
" these people write so confusingly , so cryptically , i just do n't like their criticism , " he continued .
" i will say loud and clear what i think about books .
it is risky , and two things could happen : i will either rise to the top of the literary criticism hierarchy , or sink to the very bottom .
but i have to try . "
reich-ranicki has remained incorruptible and sharp in his opinions , and he does n't mince words .
that attitude has cost him a few friends over the years .
his dedication to speaking the truth as he sees it was behind a major uproar in 2008 , when he was invited to receive an honorary german television prize for his cultural contributions .
as recipients awaiting awards usually do , he sat passively in the audience as one tv personality after another came up to make a speech , accept an award , or tell a few jokes .
critic who speaks his mind he was definitely not impressed with what he saw - and he made no secret of his feelings .
when the time came for him to accept his honorary award , he stunned viewers by rejecting it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel awarded reich-ranicki the henri-nannen prize in 2008 " i can not accept this prize , " reich-ranicki told the shocked audience .
" i did n't know what to expect here , and i think it is awful that i had to sit through this for so many hours . "
at first , some of the guests at the ceremony thought reich-ranicki was joking .
but in this case he was simply telling it like he saw it - live and on the air .
by giving an open , radical critique of what he saw as the poor state of german television , reich-ranicki underlined his reputation as something of a crank , not to mention a " hard taskmaster " and a " a specialist in executions , " as different critics have put it .
reich-ranicki answers his detractors by saying that indeed , his first and foremost job is to be tough and critical .
years on ' literary quartet ' " being called an ' execution specialist ' is really nonsense , " reich-ranicki told broadcaster wdr in a 1986 interview .
" but i try to be clear in my criticism .
and the clarity of criticism , well , that is a question of politesse .
you have to be polite to the readers .
and that means being clear and explicit with your meaning , not hiding behind ambiguous or enigmatic phrases . "
his appearances as the head critic on television 's " literary quartet " between 1988 and 2001 brought reich-ranicki to the small screen some 77 times - automatically launching him to the top of germany 's lit-crit pop cultural heap .
despite his fame , however , he certainly is n't infallible .
and if he had a reputation for judging literature based more on his personal reading preferences than on serious criticism , well , that did n't stop his opinion from making and breaking many a literary career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his 2008 rejection of the german tv prize came as a shock those who raised his wrath - peter handke , guenter grass or martin walser , for example - had to fight their way into the market .
on the contrary , favorites such as spanish writer javier marias or berlin chronicler judith hermann more or less owe their success to reich-ranicki 's praises .
boring book ?
bad news the worst thing that reich-ranicki could say about a book was : " boring . "
his anti-academic , folksy and agreeably polemical ideas about literature can most likely be traced back to his own , sad biography .
as a persecuted jew he escaped the warsaw ghetto and various deportations , as though by a miracle .
at the time , a polish printer hid reich-ranicki and his wife from the nazis .
in payment , the literature lover regaled his benefactors with an endless slew of stories : shakespeare , goethe , schiller , etc .
telling stories to stay alive - the experience made a lasting impression on reich-ranicki , whose biggest successes came when he broke literary-criticism taboos .
years later , he wrote his own life story , and - unlike the biographies of many other critics - this one became a bestseller .

these and many other public appearances where he freely made his pronouncements on german books and writing have made him one of germany 's best-known cultural critics .
reich-ranicki , who is celebrating his 90th birthday on june 2 , is also one of just a handful of jewish public figures in germany to resettle in the country after having survived world war ii .
born in 1920 in wloclawek , poland , the future critic attended high school in berlin .
because he was jewish , he was denied entry to the university .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the critic , just ending his ninth decade , is still up for an argument after being deported to poland , reich-ranicki was able to flee the warsaw ghetto with his wife , tosia .
in 1958 , he returned to germany and dedicated himself to the study of german language and literature - and saw an opening for himself in the world of german letters .
risky career move " when i came to germany in ' 58 , and i saw what people were writing about literature in the -lsb- newspapers here , -rsb- i told my wife : i want to do an experiment , " reich-ranicki said in an acceptance speech after receiving the north rhine-westphalia state prize in 2005 .
" these people write so confusingly , so cryptically , i just do n't like their criticism , " he continued .
" i will say loud and clear what i think about books .
it is risky , and two things could happen : i will either rise to the top of the literary criticism hierarchy , or sink to the very bottom .
but i have to try . "
reich-ranicki has remained incorruptible and sharp in his opinions , and he does n't mince words .
that attitude has cost him a few friends over the years .
his dedication to speaking the truth as he sees it was behind a major uproar in 2008 , when he was invited to receive an honorary german television prize for his cultural contributions .
as recipients awaiting awards usually do , he sat passively in the audience as one tv personality after another came up to make a speech , accept an award , or tell a few jokes .
critic who speaks his mind he was definitely not impressed with what he saw - and he made no secret of his feelings .
when the time came for him to accept his honorary award , he stunned viewers by rejecting it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel awarded reich-ranicki the henri-nannen prize in 2008 " i can not accept this prize , " reich-ranicki told the shocked audience .
" i did n't know what to expect here , and i think it is awful that i had to sit through this for so many hours . "
at first , some of the guests at the ceremony thought reich-ranicki was joking .
but in this case he was simply telling it like he saw it - live and on the air .
by giving an open , radical critique of what he saw as the poor state of german television , reich-ranicki underlined his reputation as something of a crank , not to mention a " hard taskmaster " and a " a specialist in executions , " as different critics have put it .
reich-ranicki answers his detractors by saying that indeed , his first and foremost job is to be tough and critical .
years on ' literary quartet ' " being called an ' execution specialist ' is really nonsense , " reich-ranicki told broadcaster wdr in a 1986 interview .
" but i try to be clear in my criticism .
and the clarity of criticism , well , that is a question of politesse .
you have to be polite to the readers .
and that means being clear and explicit with your meaning , not hiding behind ambiguous or enigmatic phrases . "
his appearances as the head critic on television 's " literary quartet " between 1988 and 2001 brought reich-ranicki to the small screen some 77 times - automatically launching him to the top of germany 's lit-crit pop cultural heap .
despite his fame , however , he certainly is n't infallible .
and if he had a reputation for judging literature based more on his personal reading preferences than on serious criticism , well , that did n't stop his opinion from making and breaking many a literary career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his 2008 rejection of the german tv prize came as a shock those who raised his wrath - peter handke , guenter grass or martin walser , for example - had to fight their way into the market .
on the contrary , favorites such as spanish writer javier marias or berlin chronicler judith hermann more or less owe their success to reich-ranicki 's praises .
boring book ?
bad news the worst thing that reich-ranicki could say about a book was : " boring . "
his anti-academic , folksy and agreeably polemical ideas about literature can most likely be traced back to his own , sad biography .
as a persecuted jew he escaped the warsaw ghetto and various deportations , as though by a miracle .
at the time , a polish printer hid reich-ranicki and his wife from the nazis .
in payment , the literature lover regaled his benefactors with an endless slew of stories : shakespeare , goethe , schiller , etc .
telling stories to stay alive - the experience made a lasting impression on reich-ranicki , whose biggest successes came when he broke literary-criticism taboos .
years later , he wrote his own life story , and - unlike the biographies of many other critics - this one became a bestseller .

the accusations are in connection with the hiring of a priest alleged to have been a sex offender in the 1980s . german prosecutors announced on wednesday that they were investigating claims that the head of the german bishops ' conference , robert zollitsch , aided and abetted a known sex offender in the church .
prosecutors said that they had received information indicating that , while zollitsch was in charge of the personnel department of a diocese in southern germany in 1987 , he appointed a priest who was known to have abused children .
the archdiocese of freiburg has released a statement denying that zollitsch was responsible for the appointment .
aiding and abetting prosecutors confirmed that they had launched an investigation , following reports by public broadcaster ard and the suedkurier newspaper .
the freiburg archdiocese has described the media reports as " absolutely weak " and " sensationalist . "
in 1987 zollitsch was head of the human resources department of the diocese of freiburg .
he is accused of rehiring a priest accused of sexually abusing children in a monestary in the 1960s .
the diocese says that the appointment was entirely in the hands of the monastery 's abbot , and that zollitsch neither knew of the original allegations nor the subsequent re-appointment .
part of a wider scandal sexual abuse scandals have rocked the church in germany since january , when dozens of cases emerged involving allegations of the sexual molestation of minors by priests and other clergy over a period of 50 years at catholic schools .
as head of the bishops ' conference , zollitsch has been at the forefront of the catholic church 's response to the ongoing reports of abuse .
he has often stated that the church needs to reform and " heal the wounds of victims . "
in his easter messages to his freiburg parishoners , he said the catholic church must examine its " dark aspects as well as our own shadowy sides .

in this week 's scrubbing up , clinical psychologist professor til wykes says strategies for funding research into mental health need to be overhauled .
patients and their families deserve better , she says .
when it comes to thinking about mental health , i 'd like to believe we 've come a long way from the victorian stereotypes of hysterical women and crazed madmen languishing in bedlam .
but while physical diseases like cancer are managing to throw off the stigma they carried in previous centuries , mental illnesses are still too often ignored or misunderstood .
not only does this lead to prejudice and discrimination , it also seems to make it harder to find funding for research into the causes of , and treatments for , mental ill health .
improving care and treatment for people with mental health problems requires the same rigorous research as demanded for tackling physical illness .
however , despite the huge burden that poor mental health represents to society - from the disabling effects on individuals and their families , to the financial costs of dealing with mental illness - mental health research is incredibly underfunded .
in these austere times , it is worth bearing in mind that in england alone mental health issues cost us £ 77bn a year your comments only 5 % of medical research in the uk is into mental health , despite 15 % of disability resulting from disease being due to mental illness .
it 's estimated that one in four of us - 15 million people of all ages in the uk - will experience a mental health problem this year .
that 's substantially more people than will have a heart attack or a stroke , and yet twice as much research goes into heart disease and stroke than is carried out in mental health .
it 's more people than will be diagnosed with cancer this year , and yet cancer gets more than 25 % of medical research funding - five times as much as mental health .
in these austere times , it is also worth bearing in mind that in england alone mental health issues cost us £ 77bn a year .
if we had a better understanding of mental health and better treatments for specific conditions , it would go a significant way to easing the nation 's financial situation , as well as our states of mind .
last week , one of the major research funders , the medical research council , published one of the most up to date reviews of the strengths and challenges of mental health research in the uk .
it not only showed that the research that does get funded is world-class but that the uk is well-placed to lead the way in this area .
the review concludes that there are several opportunities to fund more research in the uk that would help accelerate progress in developing new treatments , or lead to better ways of preventing mental illness in the first place .
it means we have to set priorities .
we have to direct the funding that is available into the research most likely to help .
but -lrb- and there always is a but -rrb- it sets the bar high in terms of funding decisions over the next few years and challenges the uk to really pull its weight in this much needed research arena .
mental health problems frequently start in childhood and persist throughout the rest of a person 's life .
finding better ways to treat - or preferably prevent - poor mental health as early as possible will bring enormous benefits to individuals , their families and society as a whole .
we simply ca n't afford to ignore this problem any longer .

in this week 's scrubbing up , clinical psychologist professor til wykes says strategies for funding research into mental health need to be overhauled .
patients and their families deserve better , she says .
when it comes to thinking about mental health , i 'd like to believe we 've come a long way from the victorian stereotypes of hysterical women and crazed madmen languishing in bedlam .
but while physical diseases like cancer are managing to throw off the stigma they carried in previous centuries , mental illnesses are still too often ignored or misunderstood .
not only does this lead to prejudice and discrimination , it also seems to make it harder to find funding for research into the causes of , and treatments for , mental ill health .
improving care and treatment for people with mental health problems requires the same rigorous research as demanded for tackling physical illness .
however , despite the huge burden that poor mental health represents to society - from the disabling effects on individuals and their families , to the financial costs of dealing with mental illness - mental health research is incredibly underfunded .
in these austere times , it is worth bearing in mind that in england alone mental health issues cost us £ 77bn a year your comments only 5 % of medical research in the uk is into mental health , despite 15 % of disability resulting from disease being due to mental illness .
it 's estimated that one in four of us - 15 million people of all ages in the uk - will experience a mental health problem this year .
that 's substantially more people than will have a heart attack or a stroke , and yet twice as much research goes into heart disease and stroke than is carried out in mental health .
it 's more people than will be diagnosed with cancer this year , and yet cancer gets more than 25 % of medical research funding - five times as much as mental health .
in these austere times , it is also worth bearing in mind that in england alone mental health issues cost us £ 77bn a year .
if we had a better understanding of mental health and better treatments for specific conditions , it would go a significant way to easing the nation 's financial situation , as well as our states of mind .
last week , one of the major research funders , the medical research council , published one of the most up to date reviews of the strengths and challenges of mental health research in the uk .
it not only showed that the research that does get funded is world-class but that the uk is well-placed to lead the way in this area .
the review concludes that there are several opportunities to fund more research in the uk that would help accelerate progress in developing new treatments , or lead to better ways of preventing mental illness in the first place .
it means we have to set priorities .
we have to direct the funding that is available into the research most likely to help .
but -lrb- and there always is a but -rrb- it sets the bar high in terms of funding decisions over the next few years and challenges the uk to really pull its weight in this much needed research arena .
mental health problems frequently start in childhood and persist throughout the rest of a person 's life .
finding better ways to treat - or preferably prevent - poor mental health as early as possible will bring enormous benefits to individuals , their families and society as a whole .
we simply ca n't afford to ignore this problem any longer .
