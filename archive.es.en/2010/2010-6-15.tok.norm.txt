although recycling can help protect the environment and save resources , a closer look at the electronic scrap business reveals an extremely harmful industry .
it represents a massive health hazard for those whose job it is to sort out the old computers , cd players and printers from the west . " take a look , no problem . "
harish puts his bare hands into a big plastic container that is filled with a greenish liquid , which is bubbling at the surface .
it turns out to be nitric acid .
it burns the eyes and the nose if you hold your head too close . harish , who works on the outskirts of delhi on an industrial estate that has not been approved by the state , does know that his job could damage his health , especially his respiratory tracts .
but what else can he do , he asks .
he has no qualifications . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large amount of the world 's electronic waste goes to india for recycling dangerous process ravi aggarwal works with the ngo toxics link .
he explains how dangerous the chemical etching process is – anything that can fetch money is put in an acid bath : " it is extremely corrosive , which is the whole idea .
so when you put an epoxy board in it , then it melts away the board and leaves the copper to be stripped and to be recycled .
it can cause very strong burns , and when you throw it out , it will corrode everything around it .
but there are also fumes which come out . " the recyclers then sell on the copper from the electronic scrap that has come from all over the world – often by illegal means , says aggarwal : " all the e-waste that comes in comes in not as e-waste but under other categories or permitted ways , such as ' mixed metal scrap ' .
so we have seen containers and tracked bills of entry , which are customs documents , which contain e-waste .
our estimate is from 50,000 to 60,000 tons of electronic waste per year at least that has come in . " bildunterschrift : a worker sorts electronic equipment for recycling government ambivalent india 's coast is long and there are hardly any controls .
however , recently a scandal erupted when radioactive scrap was found on a garbage heap in the middle of delhi .
the government has promised to take action and laws are currently under debate but ravi aggarwal is skeptical . " it is very easy to stop .
you just have to put scanners at the ports and you can stop it .
but i think there is an ambivalence in government policy , because the government is saying : ok , we do n't want it , but it is good for the economy .
so , all the policy statements have been ambivalent about it .
i think this ambivalence means that they are not really serious about stopping it . " recently , government officials have started appearing at the industrial estate on the outskirts of delhi , a place where there are literally towers of garbage .
they have banned the use of acid baths and the burning of poisonous scrap . however , a man who runs a small recycling business doubts whether people will heed the government 's warnings .
he says he is not worried at all .
anyone whose business is shut down will just be able to move somewhere else .
he is sure that electronic scrap will continue to end up in india . author : kai kuestner / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

'
group mates ivory coast and portugal finished scoreless , while a late new zealand goal saved a point against slovakia . in the world cup debut of the so-called ' group of death ' - formally known as group g - brazil emerged on top after its 2-1 win over north korea . perennial world cup favorites brazil dominated possession in the first half but a resolute north korean defense kept coach carlos dunga 's squad from finding the back of the net . brazil kept up the pressure in the second half , continuing to probe north korea 's defense but being turned away every time . that changed in the 55th minute .
brazilian midfielder elano played a through-ball to defender maicon , who fired a nearly sideways shot from less than a meter from the end line .
the ball slipped between north korean keeper ri myong guk and the near post before curving over the line and into the goal . bildunterschrift : north korea was on defense for most of the game the brazilians added a second goal in the 72nd minute .
this time it was elano who took the easy shot following a precision cross from robinho . if history is any guide , it was only a matter of time before one of brazil 's attacks made it through : the brazilians have scored at least one goal in every group stage match of the world cup since 1978 , when they drew 0-0 against spain . north korea pulled one back near the end of the game as forward jong tae se laid down a header in front of defender ji yun nam , who booted the ball over brazilian keeper julio cesar to score in the 89th minute . drogba back in action despite playing a hard-fought match on both sides , neither team in the other group g match between the ivory coast and portugal had a particularly high number of scoring opportunities , and the ones that did come along never resulted in a goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drogba 's broken arm did n't keep him out of the world cup for long one highlight of the game for the ivory coast was the return of their star captain , didier drogba .
the forward broke his arm in a warm-up match against japan 11 days ago , and his status for the group g opener against portugal was questionable . although drogba did n't start , he was subbed in the 66th minute for salomon kalou , a teammate of drogba 's at fc chelsea . the ivory coast 's next match is a big one in the group as they face brazil .
portugal faces north korea on monday . better late than never it took new zealand literally the entire game , but their lone goal against slovakia could n't have come at a better time .
slovakia looked to be on their way to a 1-0 win as the referee indicated three minutes of injury time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reid -lrb- left -rrb- celebrates his last-second goal for new zealand but new zealand put together a hectic offensive sequence after two and a half minutes of injury time and managed to tie the game , salvaging a point in group f with the 1-1 draw . with the final whistle seconds away , new zealand forward shane smeltz delivered a cross to defender winston reid , who connected for a header . slovakia 's goal was nearly identical but came in the 50th minute .
after slowly building up an attack , slovakian forward stanislav sestak launched a curling cross that was right on target for robert vittek to score on a header . the group 's other teams , italy and paraguay , also played to a 1-1 tie on monday night , meaning group f is all square with one point per team . author : matt zuvela editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's development minister wants to merge them under a single name . development minister dirk niebel announced tuesday that he wants to consolidate three of germany 's international development agencies into one entity , to be called the german association for international cooperation .
niebel said the move would increase efficiency and reduce red tape .

it would officially come into existence on january 1 , 2011 - if the federal cabinet approves the change in a vote scheduled for july 7 .
the three agencies currently employ a total of 17,000 people worldwide .

niebel said he had talked to the finance minister about allowing the savings from the consolidation to remain within the ministry budget - so that although the ministry would not see any funding increases until 2014 , it would n't see any budget cuts , either .
the plan has been criticized by the opposition social democrats ' spokesperson for development policy , sascha raabe .

group g. and though brazil are favored , no one knows what the table will look like in the end . when ivory coast kick off against portugal on tuesday afternoon , a tournament that 's thus far been somewhat short of highlights will probably shift up a gear .
together with the selecao and north korea , those two squads comprise one of the strongest , and certainly the strangest , " group of death " in world cup history .
there are compelling storylines galore : a former colonial power up against an ersatz colony , the top soccer nation on the planet taking on the world 's most secretive country , two of the sport 's top stars bidding for elusive international success , and the top team in africa trying to measure up to the best of south america .
one thing is clear .
of brazil , portugal and ivory coast , at least one team will be making an early exit .
and which team that is could come down to an intriguing joker thrown into the deck , north korea .
worries , real or feigned bildunterschrift : brazil remain the favorites all coaches of teams that are heavily favored mouth pieties about the need to respect every opponent .
but brazil 's coach carlos dunga does seem to be taking the selecao 's opening match against north korea surprisingly seriously , closing several of the team 's final practices to the public .
brazil breezed through qualifying , but this is not the same sort of team fans are used to seeing from south america 's largest nation .
dunga has emphasized tactical solidity over technical flash , leaving stars such as ronaldinho out of the squad .
the selecao still have a surfeit of talent , of course , with forward robinho and midfield general kaka both fit and capable of scoring the goals brazil need .
still , brazil 's players are sticking to the humble script .
" when we look at history , brazil may have many more titles than they do , but once the match starts we will need to have the same respect as we would have to any other team , " midfielder elano told germany 's dpa news agency ahead of the match with north korea .
and legendary former brazil player socrates told the bbc before the start of tournament that they were fielding a too-workmanlike squad of players with questionable fitness , and predicted the selecao would have difficulties in the group stage .
astonishingly , it 's been the underdogs doing most of the big talking .
the asian wayne rooney bildunterschrift : the man on the right is considered the asian wayne north korea have only taken part in one previous world cup , and that was back in 1966 - although they did score a shocking upset of italy in the group stage .
but their coach kim jong-hun says the outsiders do indeed have a chance in the toughest of all groups .
" in football , the best teams do n't necessarily win , " kim told the afp news agency .
" we will give it our best .
we know we need to win to reach the knockout phase , so no matter who we 're up against , we 'll target the three points . "
almost the entire squad plays its football in the domestic north korean league .
but striker jong tae-se plies his trade in japan , where he has become known as the " asian wayne rooney . "
" the match will be very difficult , but we can beat brazil , " jong told dpa .
" our team has a mentality similar to the german one , which is the best in the world . "
anticipation is making him wait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drogba is working hard on his comeback ahead of the ivory coast-portugal clash , much of the attention has focussed on two superstars .
ivory coast are hoping that striker didier drogba can recover from a fractured elbow picked up in a pre-tournament friendly .
his status is touch-and-go .
but even if les elephants have to do without their top scorer , the players think they ' ve gained enough discipline under new coach sven-goran eriksson to get the results that have eluded them in the past .
" we 've always had good players but have never been able to properly work together as an effective unit , defending and attacking as one , " ivory coast defender kolo toure told dpa .
" that 's what we 've been working on , and we hope that it will bear fruit , starting with our first match versus portugal . "
on the other side , portugal hope their superstar , cristiano ronaldo , the 2008-09 footballer of the year , can end a 16-month scoreless streak in international competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo is keeping his head up but cr7 would n't be cr7 , if he lacked confidence .
" it 's like a great player once told me , goals are like ketchup , " ronaldo told dpa .
" you keep on forcing it , then it comes all at once . "
portugese fans better hope the ketchup starts flowing because scoring goals - lots of them - may be the key to surviving this group .
the tie-breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group could be a lottery in the end in a group this tight , it 's entirely possible that two teams might end up level on points in second place in the final table .
according to the rules laid out by football 's world governing body fifa , goal difference is to be used to break any ties .
and that would make an 8-nil thrashing of north korea , for instance , of enormous value .
even stranger would be the scenario if three teams ended up level on points .
the goal-difference rule applies there as well , but there has considerable confusion about precisely how it , and other rules , would be applied in this unlikely but possible scenario .
if else fails , the decision will be made by flipping a coin .
that is extremely , extremely unlikely , but anything could happen in a group of death with more than its fair share of oddities .

together with the selecao and north korea , those two squads comprise one of the strongest , and certainly the strangest , " group of death " in world cup history .
there are compelling storylines galore : a former colonial power up against an ersatz colony , the top soccer nation on the planet taking on the world 's most secretive country , two of the sport 's top stars bidding for elusive international success , and the top team in africa trying to measure up to the best of south america .
one thing is clear .

brazil breezed through qualifying , but this is not the same sort of team fans are used to seeing from south america 's largest nation .
dunga has emphasized tactical solidity over technical flash , leaving stars such as ronaldinho out of the squad .
the selecao still have a surfeit of talent , of course , with forward robinho and midfield general kaka both fit and capable of scoring the goals brazil need .

" in football , the best teams do n't necessarily win , " kim told the afp news agency .
" we will give it our best .
we know we need to win to reach the knockout phase , so no matter who we 're up against , we 'll target the three points . "
almost the entire squad plays its football in the domestic north korean league .

his status is touch-and-go .
but even if les elephants have to do without their top scorer , the players think they ' ve gained enough discipline under new coach sven-goran eriksson to get the results that have eluded them in the past .

" that 's what we 've been working on , and we hope that it will bear fruit , starting with our first match versus portugal . "
on the other side , portugal hope their superstar , cristiano ronaldo , the 2008-09 footballer of the year , can end a 16-month scoreless streak in international competition .

" it 's like a great player once told me , goals are like ketchup , " ronaldo told dpa .

long road for serbia another country to move closer to eu membership monday was serbia , although the balkan state has a longer road ahead of it than iceland .
the foreign ministers agreed to implement with serbia the stabilization and association agreement , an aid and trade agreement that is recognized as the first official step to full eu membership .
the decision was reportedly based on serbia 's improved cooperation with the united nations-sponsored international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
the court 's chief prosecutor , serge brammertz , briefed the ministers on serbia 's efforts to search out an capture indicted genocide suspect ratko mladic .
but british foreign secretary hague added that there is still " no positive news about the arrest , " and that " serbia has not completed its task . "
serbia formally submitted its bid to join the eu last december .
it is likely to face years of preparations , including democratic and economic reforms .

german foreign minister guido westerwelle called the sanctions , which could be enacted as early as june 26 , " an important signal of determination " to the iranian leadership .
" we wanted to show that we are not only supporting the international community , but that we europeans can make our own contribution to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear weapons , " he said .
the sanctions reportedly go further than those imposed by the un security council last wednesday , targeting trade and the transportation and financial sectors .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has reportedly stepped up its search for mladic iceland hopes to achieve eu membership after a speedy 12 to 24 months of accession talks .
while it was once largely skeptical about the eu , it applied for membership in 2009 after its large banking sector was crippled by the global financial crisis .
long road for serbia another country to move closer to eu membership monday was serbia , although the balkan state has a longer road ahead of it than iceland .
the foreign ministers agreed to implement with serbia the stabilization and association agreement , an aid and trade agreement that is recognized as the first official step to full eu membership .
the decision was reportedly based on serbia 's improved cooperation with the united nations-sponsored international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
the court 's chief prosecutor , serge brammertz , briefed the ministers on serbia 's efforts to search out an capture indicted genocide suspect ratko mladic .
but british foreign secretary hague added that there is still " no positive news about the arrest , " and that " serbia has not completed its task . "
serbia formally submitted its bid to join the eu last december .
it is likely to face years of preparations , including democratic and economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western powers fear iran is building a nuclear bomb iran sanctions the wide-ranging foreign ministers meeting also reached a deal on recommending a package of sanctions against iran for its controversial nuclear program , which the west claims is to build a nuclear bomb and iran claims is for civilian purposes .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle called the sanctions , which could be enacted as early as june 26 , " an important signal of determination " to the iranian leadership .
" we wanted to show that we are not only supporting the international community , but that we europeans can make our own contribution to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear weapons , " he said .
the sanctions reportedly go further than those imposed by the un security council last wednesday , targeting trade and the transportation and financial sectors .

but the lack of mass rallies should n't be seen as a lack of public anger . when the oil tanker erika sank and broke apart off the french coast in december 1999 , the public was outraged .
an estimated crowd of 20,000 demonstrated at a rally in nantes against french oil giant total whose leased vessel had spilled approximately three million gallons of oil .
the disaster killed as many as 75,000 birds and spoiled around 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- of the coast .
three years later when the oil tanker prestige sank off the galician coast causing spain 's biggest environmental catastrophe in history , the spaniards took the the streets as well .
at least 12,000 demonstrators gathered at one rally in barcelona alone to voice their anger over the crisis management of the spanish government .
the prestige 's spill of around 20 million gallons of oil contaminated large parts of the french and spanish coasts .
the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico dwarfs both the erika and prestige disasters .
according to recent revised estimates the deepwater horizon rig has already leaked between 42 and 100 million gallons into the water with no end in sight .
that means the bp leak is causing a spill the size of the exxon valez disaster every five to 13 days .
it is by far the worst environmental disaster in us history .
few protestors at bp headquarters and yet after weeks of uninterrupted spilling , a recent rally at bp 's washington headquarters according to media reports attracted only a few dozen protesters .
a protest event in new orleans , which is directly affected by the spill , also drew only some 200 people according to media reports . " that 's not the us style , " michael e. kraft , professor of public and environmental affairs at the university of wisconsin-green bay , told deutsche welle .
" people do n't protest like that over almost anything .
but i would n't take that to mean that there is a lack of public concern . "
his colleague christoph goerg , an expert for global environmental governance at the leipzig-based helmholtz centre for environmental research , agrees : " i do n't think that the environmental consciousness in the us is generally less-developed than in europe . "
goerg believes that the absence of mass gatherings is a characteristic of the political culture in the us and the ability and the willingness of the people to articulate themselves publicly .
" what is definitely different especially compared to france , but also spain , is that in those countries there are very strong lobby groups of fishermen , but also farmers who are able not only to articulate themselves , but also to organize the people most affected by the spill and give them a public platform . " opinion polls show frustration of crisis management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of spaniards demonstrated after the prestige disaster while americans may not flock to the streets , numerous opinion surveys show that the us public is in fact deeply worried about the disaster .
seventy percent of americans , according to one poll , disapprove of bp 's handling of the crisis .
president barack obama 's crisis management has also been heavily criticized .
there are also indications of a significant shift in public opinion over offshore drilling .
in florida , one of the worst affected states , according to a new poll 51 percent of floridians now oppose new offshore drilling .
before the disaster 66 percent were in favor of drilling and only 27 against it .
but is there no way to gauge the public sentiment beyond mere surveys ?
sure , say the experts .
just log on to the internet or turn on the television .
since the explosion on the oil rig , news crews are present covering the spill around the clock .
comedians like bill maher and jon stewart have targeted bp and the obama administration repeatedly .
and in the gulf states many locals have displayed placards and posters showing their frustration over bp , but also over the government 's response .
anti-bp art on the internet on the internet new groups and websites devoted to the disaster are springing up every day .
one of the biggest ones , the boycott bp group on facebook , attracts thousands of new supporters daily and currently has more than 600,000 fans .
and at the popular blog huffington post readers can vent their anger with anti-bp art .
" the public sphere is not the street alone anymore , but also the internet with its various media outlets , " explains goerg .
" a lot of public discourse is carried out over the internet in a new kind of way that also creates new forms of publicity . "
bildunterschrift : oil companies like bp face tougher regulations and higher liability this , argues goerg , has both positive and negative aspects .
" when one attends a rally with others this is something different than when one is active on twitter or voices an opinion somewhere else on the internet , " he says .
" that is more difficult during a public rally , but on the other hand , the connection with others is stronger and one feels more like being part of a group . " the most important benchmark for the effectiveness of public sentiment over the oil spill though , argues kraft , may not be how many people attend a rally , but whether the disaster affects change .
" i think you will see some real public policy changes .
almost certainly there will be very substantial increases in environmental and safety restrictions . "

an estimated crowd of 20,000 demonstrated at a rally in nantes against french oil giant total whose leased vessel had spilled approximately three million gallons of oil .
the disaster killed as many as 75,000 birds and spoiled around 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- of the coast .
three years later when the oil tanker prestige sank off the galician coast causing spain 's biggest environmental catastrophe in history , the spaniards took the the streets as well .
at least 12,000 demonstrators gathered at one rally in barcelona alone to voice their anger over the crisis management of the spanish government .
the prestige 's spill of around 20 million gallons of oil contaminated large parts of the french and spanish coasts .
the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico dwarfs both the erika and prestige disasters .
according to recent revised estimates the deepwater horizon rig has already leaked between 42 and 100 million gallons into the water with no end in sight .
that means the bp leak is causing a spill the size of the exxon valez disaster every five to 13 days .
it is by far the worst environmental disaster in us history .
few protestors at bp headquarters and yet after weeks of uninterrupted spilling , a recent rally at bp 's washington headquarters according to media reports attracted only a few dozen protesters .
a protest event in new orleans , which is directly affected by the spill , also drew only some 200 people according to media reports . " that 's not the us style , " michael e. kraft , professor of public and environmental affairs at the university of wisconsin-green bay , told deutsche welle .
" people do n't protest like that over almost anything .
but i would n't take that to mean that there is a lack of public concern . "
his colleague christoph goerg , an expert for global environmental governance at the leipzig-based helmholtz centre for environmental research , agrees : " i do n't think that the environmental consciousness in the us is generally less-developed than in europe . "
goerg believes that the absence of mass gatherings is a characteristic of the political culture in the us and the ability and the willingness of the people to articulate themselves publicly .
" what is definitely different especially compared to france , but also spain , is that in those countries there are very strong lobby groups of fishermen , but also farmers who are able not only to articulate themselves , but also to organize the people most affected by the spill and give them a public platform . " opinion polls show frustration of crisis management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of spaniards demonstrated after the prestige disaster while americans may not flock to the streets , numerous opinion surveys show that the us public is in fact deeply worried about the disaster .
seventy percent of americans , according to one poll , disapprove of bp 's handling of the crisis .
president barack obama 's crisis management has also been heavily criticized .
there are also indications of a significant shift in public opinion over offshore drilling .
in florida , one of the worst affected states , according to a new poll 51 percent of floridians now oppose new offshore drilling .
before the disaster 66 percent were in favor of drilling and only 27 against it .
but is there no way to gauge the public sentiment beyond mere surveys ?
sure , say the experts .
just log on to the internet or turn on the television .
since the explosion on the oil rig , news crews are present covering the spill around the clock .
comedians like bill maher and jon stewart have targeted bp and the obama administration repeatedly .
and in the gulf states many locals have displayed placards and posters showing their frustration over bp , but also over the government 's response .
anti-bp art on the internet on the internet new groups and websites devoted to the disaster are springing up every day .
one of the biggest ones , the boycott bp group on facebook , attracts thousands of new supporters daily and currently has more than 600,000 fans .
and at the popular blog huffington post readers can vent their anger with anti-bp art .
" the public sphere is not the street alone anymore , but also the internet with its various media outlets , " explains goerg .
" a lot of public discourse is carried out over the internet in a new kind of way that also creates new forms of publicity . "
bildunterschrift : oil companies like bp face tougher regulations and higher liability this , argues goerg , has both positive and negative aspects .
" when one attends a rally with others this is something different than when one is active on twitter or voices an opinion somewhere else on the internet , " he says .
" that is more difficult during a public rally , but on the other hand , the connection with others is stronger and one feels more like being part of a group . " the most important benchmark for the effectiveness of public sentiment over the oil spill though , argues kraft , may not be how many people attend a rally , but whether the disaster affects change .
" i think you will see some real public policy changes .
almost certainly there will be very substantial increases in environmental and safety restrictions . "
and , add the experts , one of the most important things to do is to make sure that companies like bp have a very strong financial interest in ensuring that something like this never happens again .
this process has already begun , notes kraft : " the price of bp stock has plummeted since the disaster by something like 40 percent or $ 73 billion -lrb- 60 billion euros -rrb- . so the reaction here may be a little more subtle than it is in europe . "

this process has already begun , notes kraft : " the price of bp stock has plummeted since the disaster by something like 40 percent or $ 73 billion -lrb- 60 billion euros -rrb- . so the reaction here may be a little more subtle than it is in europe . "

the report concludes that british troops were " unjustified " in firing on protestors on that day in 1972 . british prime minister david cameron has apologized on behalf of the british government for the ' bloody sunday ' massacre in northern ireland in 1972 that left 14 civilian protesters dead at the hands of british troops .
cameron presented the results of a massive 12-year inquiry into the incident to parliament on tuesday , saying that the events of bloody sunday were in no way justified .
" what happened should never , ever , have happened , " cameron said .
" some members of our armed forces acted wrongly . "
initial reports made in 1972 showed that british troops had acted appropriately when they fired on catholic civilians in londonderry .
at the time , the troops indicated that they had fired on civilians who were armed .
however , cameron said that this was not the case and added that some troops had deliberately made false statements about the shootings to make it appear that they had been justified in firing .
the report concludes that the british troops fired first and were unprovoked .
" the government is ultimately responsible for the conduct of the armed forces .
and for that , on behalf of the government , indeed on behalf of our country , i am deeply sorry , " cameron said .

the report concludes that british troops were " unjustified " in firing on protestors on that day in 1972 . british prime minister david cameron has apologized on behalf of the british government for the ' bloody sunday ' massacre in northern ireland in 1972 that left 14 civilian protesters dead at the hands of british troops .
cameron presented the results of a massive 12-year inquiry into the incident to parliament on tuesday , saying that the events of bloody sunday were in no way justified .
" what happened should never , ever , have happened , " cameron said .
" some members of our armed forces acted wrongly . "
initial reports made in 1972 showed that british troops had acted appropriately when they fired on catholic civilians in londonderry .
at the time , the troops indicated that they had fired on civilians who were armed .
however , cameron said that this was not the case and added that some troops had deliberately made false statements about the shootings to make it appear that they had been justified in firing .
the report concludes that the british troops fired first and were unprovoked .
" the government is ultimately responsible for the conduct of the armed forces .
and for that , on behalf of the government , indeed on behalf of our country , i am deeply sorry , " cameron said .

although recycling can help protect the environment and save resources , a closer look at the electronic scrap business reveals an extremely harmful industry .
it represents a massive health hazard for those whose job it is to sort out the old computers , cd players and printers from the west . " take a look , no problem . "
harish puts his bare hands into a big plastic container that is filled with a greenish liquid , which is bubbling at the surface .
it turns out to be nitric acid .
it burns the eyes and the nose if you hold your head too close . harish , who works on the outskirts of delhi on an industrial estate that has not been approved by the state , does know that his job could damage his health , especially his respiratory tracts .
but what else can he do , he asks .
he has no qualifications . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large amount of the world 's electronic waste goes to india for recycling dangerous process ravi aggarwal works with the ngo toxics link .
he explains how dangerous the chemical etching process is – anything that can fetch money is put in an acid bath : " it is extremely corrosive , which is the whole idea .
so when you put an epoxy board in it , then it melts away the board and leaves the copper to be stripped and to be recycled .
it can cause very strong burns , and when you throw it out , it will corrode everything around it .
but there are also fumes which come out . " the recyclers then sell on the copper from the electronic scrap that has come from all over the world – often by illegal means , says aggarwal : " all the e-waste that comes in comes in not as e-waste but under other categories or permitted ways , such as ' mixed metal scrap ' .
so we have seen containers and tracked bills of entry , which are customs documents , which contain e-waste .
our estimate is from 50,000 to 60,000 tons of electronic waste per year at least that has come in . " bildunterschrift : a worker sorts electronic equipment for recycling government ambivalent india 's coast is long and there are hardly any controls .
however , recently a scandal erupted when radioactive scrap was found on a garbage heap in the middle of delhi .
the government has promised to take action and laws are currently under debate but ravi aggarwal is skeptical . " it is very easy to stop .
you just have to put scanners at the ports and you can stop it .
but i think there is an ambivalence in government policy , because the government is saying : ok , we do n't want it , but it is good for the economy .
so , all the policy statements have been ambivalent about it .
i think this ambivalence means that they are not really serious about stopping it . " recently , government officials have started appearing at the industrial estate on the outskirts of delhi , a place where there are literally towers of garbage .
they have banned the use of acid baths and the burning of poisonous scrap . however , a man who runs a small recycling business doubts whether people will heed the government 's warnings .
he says he is not worried at all .
anyone whose business is shut down will just be able to move somewhere else .
he is sure that electronic scrap will continue to end up in india . author : kai kuestner / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the information implicates as many as 4,450 people with accounts with ubs . swiss lawmakers have backed a deal with the us that would see banking giant ubs forced to hand over data on 4,450 us clients suspected of tax evasion .
the swiss and us governments , along with switzerland 's largest bank ubs , had agreed the deal in 2009 , but it needed parliamentary approval after the swiss supreme court called its legality into question .
switzerland has long faced criticism from the international community over its secretive banking laws that protect the identities of account holders with banks such as ubs .
last week it seemed the deal may have been dead in the water after parties from across the political spectrum in switzerland voted against the government-brokered agreement .
approval of the deal - by 81 votes to 61 , with 53 lawmakers abstaining - was reached after the lower house was asked to hold a second vote .
technical details remain to be ironed out and the proposal may still be put to the swiss public in a referendum before it finally becomes law .
approval of the deal could go a long way to settling lawsuits by us authorities and could save switzerland and several of its banks considerable sums of money in legal fees .

the information implicates as many as 4,450 people with accounts with ubs . swiss lawmakers have backed a deal with the us that would see banking giant ubs forced to hand over data on 4,450 us clients suspected of tax evasion .
the swiss and us governments , along with switzerland 's largest bank ubs , had agreed the deal in 2009 , but it needed parliamentary approval after the swiss supreme court called its legality into question .
switzerland has long faced criticism from the international community over its secretive banking laws that protect the identities of account holders with banks such as ubs .
last week it seemed the deal may have been dead in the water after parties from across the political spectrum in switzerland voted against the government-brokered agreement .
approval of the deal - by 81 votes to 61 , with 53 lawmakers abstaining - was reached after the lower house was asked to hold a second vote .
technical details remain to be ironed out and the proposal may still be put to the swiss public in a referendum before it finally becomes law .
approval of the deal could go a long way to settling lawsuits by us authorities and could save switzerland and several of its banks considerable sums of money in legal fees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 15.06.2010 eu commission slams us rating agency over greek ' junk ' status großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moody 's junk rating comes at a bad time for greece the european union 's top economic commissioner olli rehn has criticised moody 's rating agency for downgrading greece 's debt rating as the athens government struggles to solve the country 's huge national debt . the european union commissioner for economic affairs , olli rehn , has criticized the us-based rating agency moody 's for slashing its sovereign debt rating for greece to " junk " status .
speaking during a debate in the european parliament in strasbourg , rehn said that the decision to cut greece 's rating was both " surprising " and " unfortunate " at a time when eu and imf auditors were taking a hard look at the country 's attempts to slash its debt .
the eu commissioner said that the downgrade , which he had discussed with financial services commissioner michel barnier and european commission president jose manuel barroso , " again raises issues related to the role of credit rating agencies in the financial system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn says the credit rating industry needs a shake-up rehn said that the eu commission , which is seeking to regulate ratings agencies under new reforms due to be implemented in 2011 , will probe " the level of competition in the sector " and fears that a lack of transparency could represent a " conflict of interest . "
not everyone surprised but many financial experts say the downgrade by moody 's was not totally unexpected given that rival ratings agency standard and poor 's downgraded greece 's sovereign debt to junk status in april , while fitch , the other major ratings agency , warned weeks later that it , too , may follow .
" nothing has really changed since then , " said alcidi cinzia , a research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
" the agency has just put down on paper what the market has been thinking for some time , " she told deutsche welle .
questionable creditworthiness in a statement issued monday , moody 's justified its decision to lower greece 's creditworthiness rating by four notches from a3 to ba1 by pointing to considerable market uncertainty surrounding the country 's plans to reduce its huge debt and balance its finances – even with the help of the eu-imf bailout package .
moody 's describes the ba1 rating as below investment grade - or " junk " status in market parlance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister george papandreou has been facing some tough questions the downgrade means some investors will no longer be allowed to buy greek debt under the terms of their investment mandate and could lead to still higher borrowing costs for athens if it goes to the markets for cash .
observers agree that the downgrade is yet another blow to the debt-ridden country , which is under intense international scrutiny .
last month , it narrowly avoided default after the european union and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- agreed to intervene with a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- bailout .
the bailout from the eu and the imf means that greece is highly unlikely to default in the short term , if at all .
and it gives the country a few years to get its fiscal act together .
cut spending , promote growth but the bailout is a loan - not a gift - meaning that it adds to greece 's debt .
to climb out of trouble , the country will need to cut spending and , at the same time , grow its economy .
while experts agree this will be a difficult trick to pull off , the greek government has been trying hard to promote confidence in its plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks protest the government 's sweeping austerity program so , understandably , officials in athens were n't happy with moody 's call , especially its timing .
shortly after the ratings agency released its statement , the greek ministry of finance fired off it own .
" moody 's downgrade of greek government bonds today does not reflect in any way greece 's progress over the past months , " the ministry wrote .
" nor does it reflect the potential created by the country 's effort of fiscal consolidation and increased competitiveness . "
" greece is moving ahead with all the reforms stipulated in the memorandum of understanding , -lrb- and -rrb- for many of these reforms , it is already ahead of schedule . "

not everyone surprised but many financial experts say the downgrade by moody 's was not totally unexpected given that rival ratings agency standard and poor 's downgraded greece 's sovereign debt to junk status in april , while fitch , the other major ratings agency , warned weeks later that it , too , may follow .
" nothing has really changed since then , " said alcidi cinzia , a research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
" the agency has just put down on paper what the market has been thinking for some time , " she told deutsche welle .
questionable creditworthiness in a statement issued monday , moody 's justified its decision to lower greece 's creditworthiness rating by four notches from a3 to ba1 by pointing to considerable market uncertainty surrounding the country 's plans to reduce its huge debt and balance its finances – even with the help of the eu-imf bailout package .
moody 's describes the ba1 rating as below investment grade - or " junk " status in market parlance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister george papandreou has been facing some tough questions the downgrade means some investors will no longer be allowed to buy greek debt under the terms of their investment mandate and could lead to still higher borrowing costs for athens if it goes to the markets for cash .
observers agree that the downgrade is yet another blow to the debt-ridden country , which is under intense international scrutiny .
last month , it narrowly avoided default after the european union and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- agreed to intervene with a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- bailout .
the bailout from the eu and the imf means that greece is highly unlikely to default in the short term , if at all .
and it gives the country a few years to get its fiscal act together .
cut spending , promote growth but the bailout is a loan - not a gift - meaning that it adds to greece 's debt .
to climb out of trouble , the country will need to cut spending and , at the same time , grow its economy .
while experts agree this will be a difficult trick to pull off , the greek government has been trying hard to promote confidence in its plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks protest the government 's sweeping austerity program so , understandably , officials in athens were n't happy with moody 's call , especially its timing .
shortly after the ratings agency released its statement , the greek ministry of finance fired off it own .
" moody 's downgrade of greek government bonds today does not reflect in any way greece 's progress over the past months , " the ministry wrote .
" nor does it reflect the potential created by the country 's effort of fiscal consolidation and increased competitiveness . "
" greece is moving ahead with all the reforms stipulated in the memorandum of understanding , -lrb- and -rrb- for many of these reforms , it is already ahead of schedule . "

critics fear full compensation for environmental and economic damage is unlikely . more than six weeks after the now infamous sinking of the deepwater horizon oil rig in the gulf of mexico , efforts to staunch crude oil flowing from an underwater well have only partially succeeded .
meanwhile , the environmental and financial tolls of the catastrophe have yet to be fully assessed .
tourism and fishing industries along the gulf of mexico have suffered devastating effects as oil washes ashore and vast areas of water are polluted , killing wildlife .
bp has stopped referring to the catastrophe using the name of the " deepwater horizon " rig in favor of using the short-form name of the well it dug , " mc252 . "
it has also limited press access to affected areas , limited the release of information and bought up spill-related online search terms at major search engines .
obama foresees policy changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said the spill will shape future environment and energy policies w hile bp has already agreed to some financial compensation , skeptics doubt the full costs of the spill will ever be recovered .
currently bp is collecting about 15,000 barrels of oil a day – about half the amount believed to be leaking .
the company 's latest plan follows pressure from the obama administration and calls for more than 50,000 barrels a day to be collected by the end of june .
the well is expected to continue leaking until bp completes the first of two relief wells in august .
obama said in a recent interview the spill would alter us policy during coming years .
he has also lamented the threat posed to the gulf of mexico coastline with its wildlife-filled wetlands , beaches and waters teeming with shrimps , crabs and fish .
" in the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9/11 , i think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come , " he told the washington-based news organization politico .
fair compensation doubted a number of ngos fear that local populations and ecosystems will ultimately shoulder the catastrophe 's most significant burdens while bp minimizes losses for itself and its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers cleaning up spilled oil may later suffer health problems greenpeace spokeswoman cindy baxter said she expects a scenario similar to the aftermath of the 1989 exxon valdez spill , during which 40,000 tons of crude oil leaked into alaska 's prince william sound .
that resulted in a 19-year legal process over a five-billion-dollar compensation deal .
" exxon has taken it through the courts , and through the courts , and through the courts .
the original five billion dollars ?
that estimated amount of compensation has now been reduced to $ 500 million .
people who wanted compensation died looking for it .
that includes workers who were working on the spill and have had huge amounts of health problems from working with the dispersants that they used , " she told deutsche welle .
economic interests at risk in addition to the damage caused by the current disaster , experts say prospecting for fossil fuels will likely become riskier in the future as energy demand rises and easily accessible resources dwindle .
advocates for renewable energy sources have been quick to point this out .
felix matthes , an expert on renewable energy at the berlin institute for applied ecology , says aggressive development of renewable energy infrastructure is a necessary investment which can be unified with economic interests .
" this catastrophe in the gulf of mexico has made it clear that the current use of energy – especially as accessing raw materials becomes ever more complicated , and this access means disturbing ever more delicate ecosystems – can come at a high cost , " he told deutsche welle .

critics fear full compensation for environmental and economic damage is unlikely . more than six weeks after the now infamous sinking of the deepwater horizon oil rig in the gulf of mexico , efforts to staunch crude oil flowing from an underwater well have only partially succeeded .
meanwhile , the environmental and financial tolls of the catastrophe have yet to be fully assessed .
tourism and fishing industries along the gulf of mexico have suffered devastating effects as oil washes ashore and vast areas of water are polluted , killing wildlife .
bp has stopped referring to the catastrophe using the name of the " deepwater horizon " rig in favor of using the short-form name of the well it dug , " mc252 . "
it has also limited press access to affected areas , limited the release of information and bought up spill-related online search terms at major search engines .
obama foresees policy changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said the spill will shape future environment and energy policies w hile bp has already agreed to some financial compensation , skeptics doubt the full costs of the spill will ever be recovered .
currently bp is collecting about 15,000 barrels of oil a day – about half the amount believed to be leaking .
the company 's latest plan follows pressure from the obama administration and calls for more than 50,000 barrels a day to be collected by the end of june .
the well is expected to continue leaking until bp completes the first of two relief wells in august .
obama said in a recent interview the spill would alter us policy during coming years .
he has also lamented the threat posed to the gulf of mexico coastline with its wildlife-filled wetlands , beaches and waters teeming with shrimps , crabs and fish .
" in the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9/11 , i think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come , " he told the washington-based news organization politico .
fair compensation doubted a number of ngos fear that local populations and ecosystems will ultimately shoulder the catastrophe 's most significant burdens while bp minimizes losses for itself and its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers cleaning up spilled oil may later suffer health problems greenpeace spokeswoman cindy baxter said she expects a scenario similar to the aftermath of the 1989 exxon valdez spill , during which 40,000 tons of crude oil leaked into alaska 's prince william sound .
that resulted in a 19-year legal process over a five-billion-dollar compensation deal .
" exxon has taken it through the courts , and through the courts , and through the courts .
the original five billion dollars ?
that estimated amount of compensation has now been reduced to $ 500 million .
people who wanted compensation died looking for it .
that includes workers who were working on the spill and have had huge amounts of health problems from working with the dispersants that they used , " she told deutsche welle .
economic interests at risk in addition to the damage caused by the current disaster , experts say prospecting for fossil fuels will likely become riskier in the future as energy demand rises and easily accessible resources dwindle .

critics fear full compensation for environmental and economic damage is unlikely . more than six weeks after the now infamous sinking of the deepwater horizon oil rig in the gulf of mexico , efforts to staunch crude oil flowing from an underwater well have only partially succeeded .
meanwhile , the environmental and financial tolls of the catastrophe have yet to be fully assessed .
tourism and fishing industries along the gulf of mexico have suffered devastating effects as oil washes ashore and vast areas of water are polluted , killing wildlife .
bp has stopped referring to the catastrophe using the name of the " deepwater horizon " rig in favor of using the short-form name of the well it dug , " mc252 . "
it has also limited press access to affected areas , limited the release of information and bought up spill-related online search terms at major search engines .

currently bp is collecting about 15,000 barrels of oil a day – about half the amount believed to be leaking .
the company 's latest plan follows pressure from the obama administration and calls for more than 50,000 barrels a day to be collected by the end of june .
the well is expected to continue leaking until bp completes the first of two relief wells in august .
obama said in a recent interview the spill would alter us policy during coming years .
he has also lamented the threat posed to the gulf of mexico coastline with its wildlife-filled wetlands , beaches and waters teeming with shrimps , crabs and fish .
" in the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9/11 , i think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come , " he told the washington-based news organization politico .
fair compensation doubted a number of ngos fear that local populations and ecosystems will ultimately shoulder the catastrophe 's most significant burdens while bp minimizes losses for itself and its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers cleaning up spilled oil may later suffer health problems greenpeace spokeswoman cindy baxter said she expects a scenario similar to the aftermath of the 1989 exxon valdez spill , during which 40,000 tons of crude oil leaked into alaska 's prince william sound .

people who wanted compensation died looking for it .

economic interests at risk in addition to the damage caused by the current disaster , experts say prospecting for fossil fuels will likely become riskier in the future as energy demand rises and easily accessible resources dwindle .

currently bp is collecting about 15,000 barrels of oil a day – about half the amount believed to be leaking .
the company 's latest plan follows pressure from the obama administration and calls for more than 50,000 barrels a day to be collected by the end of june .
the well is expected to continue leaking until bp completes the first of two relief wells in august .
obama said in a recent interview the spill would alter us policy during coming years .
he has also lamented the threat posed to the gulf of mexico coastline with its wildlife-filled wetlands , beaches and waters teeming with shrimps , crabs and fish .
" in the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9/11 , i think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come , " he told the washington-based news organization politico .
fair compensation doubted a number of ngos fear that local populations and ecosystems will ultimately shoulder the catastrophe 's most significant burdens while bp minimizes losses for itself and its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers cleaning up spilled oil may later suffer health problems greenpeace spokeswoman cindy baxter said she expects a scenario similar to the aftermath of the 1989 exxon valdez spill , during which 40,000 tons of crude oil leaked into alaska 's prince william sound .
that resulted in a 19-year legal process over a five-billion-dollar compensation deal .
" exxon has taken it through the courts , and through the courts , and through the courts .
the original five billion dollars ?
that estimated amount of compensation has now been reduced to $ 500 million .
people who wanted compensation died looking for it .
that includes workers who were working on the spill and have had huge amounts of health problems from working with the dispersants that they used , " she told deutsche welle .
economic interests at risk in addition to the damage caused by the current disaster , experts say prospecting for fossil fuels will likely become riskier in the future as energy demand rises and easily accessible resources dwindle .
advocates for renewable energy sources have been quick to point this out .
felix matthes , an expert on renewable energy at the berlin institute for applied ecology , says aggressive development of renewable energy infrastructure is a necessary investment which can be unified with economic interests .
" this catastrophe in the gulf of mexico has made it clear that the current use of energy – especially as accessing raw materials becomes ever more complicated , and this access means disturbing ever more delicate ecosystems – can come at a high cost , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp may shirk fully compensating affected locals like fishermen but the global economy is still based on oil , and the oil industry enjoys political protections .
the united states ' 1990 oil pollution act , signed into law by president george bush sr. , limits liability in the case of a spill to $ 75 million .
similarly , louisiana 's senator mary landrieu has taken a stance protecting the oil industry as a whole .
david cadman of the organization local governments for sustainability said he believes bp has failed to put enough emphasis on cleanup efforts .
" the previous bush administration basically limited the liability of the oil companies in case of an accident , and i think that 's going to come home to roost .
all of a sudden we 're going to see the bills , and there 's going to be a great fight as to who should pay those bills .
and i suspect bp is going to say : ' this is the agreement we had .
we pay up to this and no more . " '

'
group mates ivory coast and portugal finished scoreless , while a late new zealand goal saved a point against slovakia . in the world cup debut of the so-called ' group of death ' - formally known as group g - brazil emerged on top after its 2-1 win over north korea . perennial world cup favorites brazil dominated possession in the first half but a resolute north korean defense kept coach carlos dunga 's squad from finding the back of the net . brazil kept up the pressure in the second half , continuing to probe north korea 's defense but being turned away every time . that changed in the 55th minute .
brazilian midfielder elano played a through-ball to defender maicon , who fired a nearly sideways shot from less than a meter from the end line .
the ball slipped between north korean keeper ri myong guk and the near post before curving over the line and into the goal . bildunterschrift : north korea was on defense for most of the game the brazilians added a second goal in the 72nd minute .
this time it was elano who took the easy shot following a precision cross from robinho . if history is any guide , it was only a matter of time before one of brazil 's attacks made it through : the brazilians have scored at least one goal in every group stage match of the world cup since 1978 , when they drew 0-0 against spain . north korea pulled one back near the end of the game as forward jong tae se laid down a header in front of defender ji yun nam , who booted the ball over brazilian keeper julio cesar to score in the 89th minute . drogba back in action despite playing a hard-fought match on both sides , neither team in the other group g match between the ivory coast and portugal had a particularly high number of scoring opportunities , and the ones that did come along never resulted in a goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drogba 's broken arm did n't keep him out of the world cup for long one highlight of the game for the ivory coast was the return of their star captain , didier drogba .
the forward broke his arm in a warm-up match against japan 11 days ago , and his status for the group g opener against portugal was questionable . although drogba did n't start , he was subbed in the 66th minute for salomon kalou , a teammate of drogba 's at fc chelsea . the ivory coast 's next match is a big one in the group as they face brazil .
portugal faces north korea on monday . better late than never it took new zealand literally the entire game , but their lone goal against slovakia could n't have come at a better time .
slovakia looked to be on their way to a 1-0 win as the referee indicated three minutes of injury time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reid -lrb- left -rrb- celebrates his last-second goal for new zealand but new zealand put together a hectic offensive sequence after two and a half minutes of injury time and managed to tie the game , salvaging a point in group f with the 1-1 draw . with the final whistle seconds away , new zealand forward shane smeltz delivered a cross to defender winston reid , who connected for a header . slovakia 's goal was nearly identical but came in the 50th minute .
after slowly building up an attack , slovakian forward stanislav sestak launched a curling cross that was right on target for robert vittek to score on a header . the group 's other teams , italy and paraguay , also played to a 1-1 tie on monday night , meaning group f is all square with one point per team . author : matt zuvela editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 15.06.2010 eu commission slams us rating agency over greek ' junk ' status großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moody 's junk rating comes at a bad time for greece the european union 's top economic commissioner olli rehn has criticised moody 's rating agency for downgrading greece 's debt rating as the athens government struggles to solve the country 's huge national debt . the european union commissioner for economic affairs , olli rehn , has criticized the us-based rating agency moody 's for slashing its sovereign debt rating for greece to " junk " status .
speaking during a debate in the european parliament in strasbourg , rehn said that the decision to cut greece 's rating was both " surprising " and " unfortunate " at a time when eu and imf auditors were taking a hard look at the country 's attempts to slash its debt .
the eu commissioner said that the downgrade , which he had discussed with financial services commissioner michel barnier and european commission president jose manuel barroso , " again raises issues related to the role of credit rating agencies in the financial system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn says the credit rating industry needs a shake-up rehn said that the eu commission , which is seeking to regulate ratings agencies under new reforms due to be implemented in 2011 , will probe " the level of competition in the sector " and fears that a lack of transparency could represent a " conflict of interest . "
not everyone surprised but many financial experts say the downgrade by moody 's was not totally unexpected given that rival ratings agency standard and poor 's downgraded greece 's sovereign debt to junk status in april , while fitch , the other major ratings agency , warned weeks later that it , too , may follow .
" nothing has really changed since then , " said alcidi cinzia , a research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
" the agency has just put down on paper what the market has been thinking for some time , " she told deutsche welle .
questionable creditworthiness in a statement issued monday , moody 's justified its decision to lower greece 's creditworthiness rating by four notches from a3 to ba1 by pointing to considerable market uncertainty surrounding the country 's plans to reduce its huge debt and balance its finances – even with the help of the eu-imf bailout package .
moody 's describes the ba1 rating as below investment grade - or " junk " status in market parlance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister george papandreou has been facing some tough questions the downgrade means some investors will no longer be allowed to buy greek debt under the terms of their investment mandate and could lead to still higher borrowing costs for athens if it goes to the markets for cash .
observers agree that the downgrade is yet another blow to the debt-ridden country , which is under intense international scrutiny .
last month , it narrowly avoided default after the european union and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- agreed to intervene with a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- bailout .
the bailout from the eu and the imf means that greece is highly unlikely to default in the short term , if at all .
and it gives the country a few years to get its fiscal act together .
cut spending , promote growth but the bailout is a loan - not a gift - meaning that it adds to greece 's debt .
to climb out of trouble , the country will need to cut spending and , at the same time , grow its economy .
while experts agree this will be a difficult trick to pull off , the greek government has been trying hard to promote confidence in its plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks protest the government 's sweeping austerity program so , understandably , officials in athens were n't happy with moody 's call , especially its timing .
shortly after the ratings agency released its statement , the greek ministry of finance fired off it own .
" moody 's downgrade of greek government bonds today does not reflect in any way greece 's progress over the past months , " the ministry wrote .
" nor does it reflect the potential created by the country 's effort of fiscal consolidation and increased competitiveness . "
" greece is moving ahead with all the reforms stipulated in the memorandum of understanding , -lrb- and -rrb- for many of these reforms , it is already ahead of schedule . "

speaking during a debate in the european parliament in strasbourg , rehn said that the decision to cut greece 's rating was both " surprising " and " unfortunate " at a time when eu and imf auditors were taking a hard look at the country 's attempts to slash its debt .
the eu commissioner said that the downgrade , which he had discussed with financial services commissioner michel barnier and european commission president jose manuel barroso , " again raises issues related to the role of credit rating agencies in the financial system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn says the credit rating industry needs a shake-up rehn said that the eu commission , which is seeking to regulate ratings agencies under new reforms due to be implemented in 2011 , will probe " the level of competition in the sector " and fears that a lack of transparency could represent a " conflict of interest . "
not everyone surprised but many financial experts say the downgrade by moody 's was not totally unexpected given that rival ratings agency standard and poor 's downgraded greece 's sovereign debt to junk status in april , while fitch , the other major ratings agency , warned weeks later that it , too , may follow .
" nothing has really changed since then , " said alcidi cinzia , a research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
" the agency has just put down on paper what the market has been thinking for some time , " she told deutsche welle .
questionable creditworthiness in a statement issued monday , moody 's justified its decision to lower greece 's creditworthiness rating by four notches from a3 to ba1 by pointing to considerable market uncertainty surrounding the country 's plans to reduce its huge debt and balance its finances – even with the help of the eu-imf bailout package .
moody 's describes the ba1 rating as below investment grade - or " junk " status in market parlance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister george papandreou has been facing some tough questions the downgrade means some investors will no longer be allowed to buy greek debt under the terms of their investment mandate and could lead to still higher borrowing costs for athens if it goes to the markets for cash .
observers agree that the downgrade is yet another blow to the debt-ridden country , which is under intense international scrutiny .
last month , it narrowly avoided default after the european union and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- agreed to intervene with a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- bailout .
the bailout from the eu and the imf means that greece is highly unlikely to default in the short term , if at all .
and it gives the country a few years to get its fiscal act together .
cut spending , promote growth but the bailout is a loan - not a gift - meaning that it adds to greece 's debt .
to climb out of trouble , the country will need to cut spending and , at the same time , grow its economy .
while experts agree this will be a difficult trick to pull off , the greek government has been trying hard to promote confidence in its plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks protest the government 's sweeping austerity program so , understandably , officials in athens were n't happy with moody 's call , especially its timing .
shortly after the ratings agency released its statement , the greek ministry of finance fired off it own .
" moody 's downgrade of greek government bonds today does not reflect in any way greece 's progress over the past months , " the ministry wrote .
" nor does it reflect the potential created by the country 's effort of fiscal consolidation and increased competitiveness . "
" greece is moving ahead with all the reforms stipulated in the memorandum of understanding , -lrb- and -rrb- for many of these reforms , it is already ahead of schedule . "

but at home , it 's struggling to juggle powerful business interests with efforts to protect its threatened rainforest . brazil is considered one of the key countries in global efforts to protect the climate .
the destruction of the rain forest alone is said to be responsible for around half of brazil 's greenhouse gas emissions .
the latin american country is the world 's fifth-largest polluter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of the chainsaw is increasingly part of daily life in the rainforest brazil 's president luiz inacio lula da silva reportedly wants to reduce the amount of amazon rain forest being cleared by 80 percent by 2020 .
but lula insists that the main responsibility for sustainable climate protection lies with the united nations .
following the failure of global climate talks in copenhagen last december , lula reportedly urged un secretary-general ban ki moon during a private meeting to press for a global agreement .
lula said the un is the right forum for discussions about climate change .
controversial dam project lula 's policy on protecting the environment and the rain forest became apparent in early february when brazil 's environment agency ibama approved the construction of a controversial hydro-electric dam belo monte in the middle of the amazon rain forest .
when it is completed , belo monte will be the third largest hydro-electric dam in the world , after the three gorges in china and itaipu , which is jointly run by brazil and paraguay .
it is expected to provide electricity to 23 million brazilian homes .
but residents as well as environmental activists have protested the building of the mega dam in the brazilian state of para .
the justice ministry in para has even tried to prevent the project but lula 's government has stood firm and pushed the project , estimated to cost billions .
construction is slated to begin later in 2010 - a year in which brazil holds general elections .
some 20,000 indigenous people are to be resettled and some 516 square kilometers -lrb- 199 square miles -rrb- of rain forest are to be flooded for the dam 's construction .
business interests damaging rain forest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainforest is being cleared away to make room for lucrative cattle ranching despite pledges by lula 's government to protect the rain forest and the global climate , tree-cutting and the clearing of forests to make way for pastures and cultivation of fields is continuing .
it 's no surprise considering that one of brazil 's leading exports includes beef used in burgers in fast food chains around the world .
that has made cattle ranching more profitable for farmers and encouraged them to deforest .
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations -lrb- fao -rrb- said in march that these business interests have led brazil to sacrifice an average of 26,000 square kilometers -lrb- 10,040 square miles -rrb- of forest each year in the past decade .
the rapid pace of deforestation has done irreparable damage to the so-called " air conditioner " of the world , as environmental activists call the rainforest .
the amazon acts as a " carbon sink , " absorbing carbon dioxide but once the trees are cut down , this absorption stops .
often the wood is burned , releasing carbon , and the loss of forest cover can also lead to carbon release from the soil .
the forest also releases enough water to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration to influence world climate patterns .
a ray of hope the gtz , a german state-owned organization working for sustainable development worldwide , says that the environment laws passed in brazil so far ca n't stop the destruction of the country 's tropical forests .
it estimates that around 680,000 square kilometers -lrb- 262,550 square miles -rrb- of rain forest in the amazon or 17 percent of its original area has been destroyed so far .
along the atlantic coast , just seven percent of rain forest has been preserved .
bildunterschrift : comparative satellite images highlight the extent of the damage in the brazilian state of rondonia the project " amazon region protected area " -lrb- arpa -rrb- , which is supported by germany , provides a ray of hope .
it was founded by lula 's predecessor fernando henrique cardoso who , in 1998 , vowed to designate 12 percent of the rain forest as an officially protected zone by 2012 .
that has now been postponed to 2016 and there are plans to declare the entire 600,000 square kilometers -lrb- 231,660 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest as a protected zone by then .
some progress has already been made .
so far around 390,000 square kilometers -lrb- 150,580 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest has been marked as a federally-protected zone .
but the gtz says that only half of that - just four percent of the amazon rain forest - is strictly protected . that 's too less , according to the group .
critics trace the lowest rate of deforestation in 2009 to the global financial crisis .
" the demand for beef , soya and wood has dramatically fallen , " paulo adario of greenpeace said .
but he added that slowing deforestation has little to do with efforts to protect the climate .
that means in the worst-case scenario , the brazilian rainforest faces another wave of erosion as soon as world markets begin clamoring for brazil 's exports again .

following the failure of global climate talks in copenhagen last december , lula reportedly urged un secretary-general ban ki moon during a private meeting to press for a global agreement .
lula said the un is the right forum for discussions about climate change .
controversial dam project lula 's policy on protecting the environment and the rain forest became apparent in early february when brazil 's environment agency ibama approved the construction of a controversial hydro-electric dam belo monte in the middle of the amazon rain forest .
when it is completed , belo monte will be the third largest hydro-electric dam in the world , after the three gorges in china and itaipu , which is jointly run by brazil and paraguay .
it is expected to provide electricity to 23 million brazilian homes .
but residents as well as environmental activists have protested the building of the mega dam in the brazilian state of para .
the justice ministry in para has even tried to prevent the project but lula 's government has stood firm and pushed the project , estimated to cost billions .
construction is slated to begin later in 2010 - a year in which brazil holds general elections .

it 's no surprise considering that one of brazil 's leading exports includes beef used in burgers in fast food chains around the world .
that has made cattle ranching more profitable for farmers and encouraged them to deforest .
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations -lrb- fao -rrb- said in march that these business interests have led brazil to sacrifice an average of 26,000 square kilometers -lrb- 10,040 square miles -rrb- of forest each year in the past decade .
the rapid pace of deforestation has done irreparable damage to the so-called " air conditioner " of the world , as environmental activists call the rainforest .

following the failure of global climate talks in copenhagen last december , lula reportedly urged un secretary-general ban ki moon during a private meeting to press for a global agreement .
lula said the un is the right forum for discussions about climate change .
controversial dam project lula 's policy on protecting the environment and the rain forest became apparent in early february when brazil 's environment agency ibama approved the construction of a controversial hydro-electric dam belo monte in the middle of the amazon rain forest .
when it is completed , belo monte will be the third largest hydro-electric dam in the world , after the three gorges in china and itaipu , which is jointly run by brazil and paraguay .
it is expected to provide electricity to 23 million brazilian homes .
but residents as well as environmental activists have protested the building of the mega dam in the brazilian state of para .
the justice ministry in para has even tried to prevent the project but lula 's government has stood firm and pushed the project , estimated to cost billions .
construction is slated to begin later in 2010 - a year in which brazil holds general elections .
some 20,000 indigenous people are to be resettled and some 516 square kilometers -lrb- 199 square miles -rrb- of rain forest are to be flooded for the dam 's construction .
business interests damaging rain forest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainforest is being cleared away to make room for lucrative cattle ranching despite pledges by lula 's government to protect the rain forest and the global climate , tree-cutting and the clearing of forests to make way for pastures and cultivation of fields is continuing .
it 's no surprise considering that one of brazil 's leading exports includes beef used in burgers in fast food chains around the world .
that has made cattle ranching more profitable for farmers and encouraged them to deforest .
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations -lrb- fao -rrb- said in march that these business interests have led brazil to sacrifice an average of 26,000 square kilometers -lrb- 10,040 square miles -rrb- of forest each year in the past decade .
the rapid pace of deforestation has done irreparable damage to the so-called " air conditioner " of the world , as environmental activists call the rainforest .
the amazon acts as a " carbon sink , " absorbing carbon dioxide but once the trees are cut down , this absorption stops .
often the wood is burned , releasing carbon , and the loss of forest cover can also lead to carbon release from the soil .
the forest also releases enough water to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration to influence world climate patterns .
a ray of hope the gtz , a german state-owned organization working for sustainable development worldwide , says that the environment laws passed in brazil so far ca n't stop the destruction of the country 's tropical forests .
it estimates that around 680,000 square kilometers -lrb- 262,550 square miles -rrb- of rain forest in the amazon or 17 percent of its original area has been destroyed so far .
along the atlantic coast , just seven percent of rain forest has been preserved .
bildunterschrift : comparative satellite images highlight the extent of the damage in the brazilian state of rondonia the project " amazon region protected area " -lrb- arpa -rrb- , which is supported by germany , provides a ray of hope .
it was founded by lula 's predecessor fernando henrique cardoso who , in 1998 , vowed to designate 12 percent of the rain forest as an officially protected zone by 2012 .
that has now been postponed to 2016 and there are plans to declare the entire 600,000 square kilometers -lrb- 231,660 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest as a protected zone by then .
some progress has already been made .
so far around 390,000 square kilometers -lrb- 150,580 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest has been marked as a federally-protected zone .
but the gtz says that only half of that - just four percent of the amazon rain forest - is strictly protected . that 's too less , according to the group .
critics trace the lowest rate of deforestation in 2009 to the global financial crisis .
" the demand for beef , soya and wood has dramatically fallen , " paulo adario of greenpeace said .
but he added that slowing deforestation has little to do with efforts to protect the climate .
that means in the worst-case scenario , the brazilian rainforest faces another wave of erosion as soon as world markets begin clamoring for brazil 's exports again .

although recycling can help protect the environment and save resources , a closer look at the electronic scrap business reveals an extremely harmful industry .
it represents a massive health hazard for those whose job it is to sort out the old computers , cd players and printers from the west . " take a look , no problem . "
harish puts his bare hands into a big plastic container that is filled with a greenish liquid , which is bubbling at the surface .
it turns out to be nitric acid .
it burns the eyes and the nose if you hold your head too close . harish , who works on the outskirts of delhi on an industrial estate that has not been approved by the state , does know that his job could damage his health , especially his respiratory tracts .
but what else can he do , he asks .
he has no qualifications . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large amount of the world 's electronic waste goes to india for recycling dangerous process ravi aggarwal works with the ngo toxics link .
he explains how dangerous the chemical etching process is – anything that can fetch money is put in an acid bath : " it is extremely corrosive , which is the whole idea .
so when you put an epoxy board in it , then it melts away the board and leaves the copper to be stripped and to be recycled .
it can cause very strong burns , and when you throw it out , it will corrode everything around it .
but there are also fumes which come out . " the recyclers then sell on the copper from the electronic scrap that has come from all over the world – often by illegal means , says aggarwal : " all the e-waste that comes in comes in not as e-waste but under other categories or permitted ways , such as ' mixed metal scrap ' .
so we have seen containers and tracked bills of entry , which are customs documents , which contain e-waste .
our estimate is from 50,000 to 60,000 tons of electronic waste per year at least that has come in . " bildunterschrift : a worker sorts electronic equipment for recycling government ambivalent india 's coast is long and there are hardly any controls .
however , recently a scandal erupted when radioactive scrap was found on a garbage heap in the middle of delhi .
the government has promised to take action and laws are currently under debate but ravi aggarwal is skeptical . " it is very easy to stop .
you just have to put scanners at the ports and you can stop it .
but i think there is an ambivalence in government policy , because the government is saying : ok , we do n't want it , but it is good for the economy .
so , all the policy statements have been ambivalent about it .
i think this ambivalence means that they are not really serious about stopping it . " recently , government officials have started appearing at the industrial estate on the outskirts of delhi , a place where there are literally towers of garbage .
they have banned the use of acid baths and the burning of poisonous scrap . however , a man who runs a small recycling business doubts whether people will heed the government 's warnings .
he says he is not worried at all .
anyone whose business is shut down will just be able to move somewhere else .
he is sure that electronic scrap will continue to end up in india . author : kai kuestner / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report concludes that british troops were " unjustified " in firing on protestors on that day in 1972 . british prime minister david cameron has apologized on behalf of the british government for the ' bloody sunday ' massacre in northern ireland in 1972 that left 14 civilian protesters dead at the hands of british troops .
cameron presented the results of a massive 12-year inquiry into the incident to parliament on tuesday , saying that the events of bloody sunday were in no way justified .
" what happened should never , ever , have happened , " cameron said .
" some members of our armed forces acted wrongly . "
initial reports made in 1972 showed that british troops had acted appropriately when they fired on catholic civilians in londonderry .
at the time , the troops indicated that they had fired on civilians who were armed .
however , cameron said that this was not the case and added that some troops had deliberately made false statements about the shootings to make it appear that they had been justified in firing .
the report concludes that the british troops fired first and were unprovoked .
" the government is ultimately responsible for the conduct of the armed forces .
and for that , on behalf of the government , indeed on behalf of our country , i am deeply sorry , " cameron said .

the three agencies currently employ a total of 17,000 people worldwide .

niebel said he had talked to the finance minister about allowing the savings from the consolidation to remain within the ministry budget - so that although the ministry would not see any funding increases until 2014 , it would n't see any budget cuts , either .
the plan has been criticized by the opposition social democrats ' spokesperson for development policy , sascha raabe .
raabe told the protestant news service -lrb- epd -rrb- that niebel lacked the courage for the required major reforms , and was instead making cosmetic changes .

the south should last longer while nobody will admit to arriving at the world cup just to make up the numbers , the realists among the 32 nations competing will know that it 's highly unlikely that they 'll get out of the group stages . no-one can say what will happen at a world cup .
previous form means little in the heat of battle at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
good teams can have bad days and bad teams can have good ones .
but there are certain teams who arrive with barely a shred of hope of getting out of the group stage .
they may make things difficult for their group opponents and maybe pull off a shock on their way out of the competition , but these are the teams who arrive with no expectations and who are just happy to be there .
there are a number of teams who may struggle in the group stages but here , deutsche welle takes a look at three teams who may already have their return tickets booked for june 26th when the knock-out stage begins .
north korea the team from the one of the world 's most secretive and repressive states is apparently resorting to type in south africa by keeping its preparations and players under cover .
journalists are given short shrift , while training sessions - which every other team has opened to the public - are held behind closed doors .
perhaps north korea are just afraid at showing their group c rivals just how bad they are .
saying that , they are at the world cup for the first time since they famously reached the quarter-finals of the 1966 finals so they ca n't be that bad – can they ?
bildunterschrift : let 's hope that the north korean team are as well-drilled and co-ordinated as their supporters qualifying from the asia conference after beating the likes of saudi arabia , jordan and united arab emirates , and holding their own with their more experienced southern neighbors , north korea – known as the chollima , a mythical horse too swift to be mounted – start with a clean slate , just like everyone else at the 2010 world cup .
but after failing to make the finals at any point in the last 44 years and finding themselves in the " group of death " with brazil , portugal and the ivory coast , it does n't matter how good or bad they are , the smart money is on north korea heading home after three games .
the team , ranked 105th in the world , is made up predominantly of players who feature in north korean teams with only a handful playing outside of the ironhanded communist state .
jong tae-se , known as asia 's wayne rooney , and an yong-hak play in japan 's j-league while striker hong yong-jo plays for russia 's fc rostov .
such is the nature of the country 's regime , very little is known about the rest of the team .
new zealand coming from one of the most laid-back countries on earth , the all whites arrive in south africa under no illusions .
faced with a group featuring world champions italy , paraguay and slovakia , the new zealand team accepts that their world cup is likely to end at the group stage .

bildunterschrift : the all whites - here in all black - may not be world beaters but they might make it harder for others however , instead of arriving expecting to get thrashed , the all whites are quietly confident that they can at least give their group f opponents a few headaches after a 1-0 friendly victory over serbia and feisty defeats to chile , to whom they lost 2-0 , and a close 2-1 loss to oceania rivals australia .
while they might not be heading for knock-out stage qualification themselves , their involvement in the tournament may at least dictate who out of their group opponents ' progress .
the minnows from the cinematic middle earth have only featured in one other word cup , in spain in 1982 , when they lost all three matches .

they recently struggled in a goalless draw with azerbaijan , labored to a 2-2 draw against belarus and also got beaten 3-0 by non-qualifier romania in their final friendly before heading to the world cup .

the 36-year-old pavon is closing in on the two-decade mark in a career which has taken him to 15 clubs and counting , in countries as disparate as italy , spain , colombia , and the united states but the team 's confidence wo n't be helped by news from home that the majority of supporters are horrified by their pre-world cup form .
pressure is building on colombian-born coach reinaldo rueda who is accused by many pundits back in honduras of having no idea as to how he wants the team to play .
with spain looking more dangerous than ever , the swiss capable of either genius or farce under ottmar hitzfeld , and high-scoring chile obsessed with fast-tempo attacking play , the best honduras can hope for is a result against switzerland and damage control against the spaniards and chileans before flying home to face their rabid press .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : oil spill in the gulf of mexico the oil disaster the world prefers to ignore bp oil spill must have global consequences , says former un expert obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist full oil spill compensation looks increasingly unlikely disasters -pipe- 15.06.2010 americans vent anger over oil spill differently from europeans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a lack of mass protests by fishermen in the gulf states compared to earlier oil disasters in europe where thousands took to the streets , the outcry in the us over the bp spill seems rather restrained .
but the lack of mass rallies should n't be seen as a lack of public anger . when the oil tanker erika sank and broke apart off the french coast in december 1999 , the public was outraged .
an estimated crowd of 20,000 demonstrated at a rally in nantes against french oil giant total whose leased vessel had spilled approximately three million gallons of oil .
the disaster killed as many as 75,000 birds and spoiled around 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- of the coast .
three years later when the oil tanker prestige sank off the galician coast causing spain 's biggest environmental catastrophe in history , the spaniards took the the streets as well .
at least 12,000 demonstrators gathered at one rally in barcelona alone to voice their anger over the crisis management of the spanish government .
the prestige 's spill of around 20 million gallons of oil contaminated large parts of the french and spanish coasts .
the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico dwarfs both the erika and prestige disasters .
according to recent revised estimates the deepwater horizon rig has already leaked between 42 and 100 million gallons into the water with no end in sight .
that means the bp leak is causing a spill the size of the exxon valez disaster every five to 13 days .
it is by far the worst environmental disaster in us history .
few protestors at bp headquarters and yet after weeks of uninterrupted spilling , a recent rally at bp 's washington headquarters according to media reports attracted only a few dozen protesters .
a protest event in new orleans , which is directly affected by the spill , also drew only some 200 people according to media reports . " that 's not the us style , " michael e. kraft , professor of public and environmental affairs at the university of wisconsin-green bay , told deutsche welle .
" people do n't protest like that over almost anything .
but i would n't take that to mean that there is a lack of public concern . "
his colleague christoph goerg , an expert for global environmental governance at the leipzig-based helmholtz centre for environmental research , agrees : " i do n't think that the environmental consciousness in the us is generally less-developed than in europe . "
goerg believes that the absence of mass gatherings is a characteristic of the political culture in the us and the ability and the willingness of the people to articulate themselves publicly .
" what is definitely different especially compared to france , but also spain , is that in those countries there are very strong lobby groups of fishermen , but also farmers who are able not only to articulate themselves , but also to organize the people most affected by the spill and give them a public platform . " opinion polls show frustration of crisis management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of spaniards demonstrated after the prestige disaster while americans may not flock to the streets , numerous opinion surveys show that the us public is in fact deeply worried about the disaster .
seventy percent of americans , according to one poll , disapprove of bp 's handling of the crisis .
president barack obama 's crisis management has also been heavily criticized .
there are also indications of a significant shift in public opinion over offshore drilling .
in florida , one of the worst affected states , according to a new poll 51 percent of floridians now oppose new offshore drilling .
before the disaster 66 percent were in favor of drilling and only 27 against it .
but is there no way to gauge the public sentiment beyond mere surveys ?
sure , say the experts .
just log on to the internet or turn on the television .
since the explosion on the oil rig , news crews are present covering the spill around the clock .
comedians like bill maher and jon stewart have targeted bp and the obama administration repeatedly .
and in the gulf states many locals have displayed placards and posters showing their frustration over bp , but also over the government 's response .
anti-bp art on the internet on the internet new groups and websites devoted to the disaster are springing up every day .
one of the biggest ones , the boycott bp group on facebook , attracts thousands of new supporters daily and currently has more than 600,000 fans .
and at the popular blog huffington post readers can vent their anger with anti-bp art .
" the public sphere is not the street alone anymore , but also the internet with its various media outlets , " explains goerg .
" a lot of public discourse is carried out over the internet in a new kind of way that also creates new forms of publicity . "
bildunterschrift : oil companies like bp face tougher regulations and higher liability this , argues goerg , has both positive and negative aspects .
" when one attends a rally with others this is something different than when one is active on twitter or voices an opinion somewhere else on the internet , " he says .
" that is more difficult during a public rally , but on the other hand , the connection with others is stronger and one feels more like being part of a group . " the most important benchmark for the effectiveness of public sentiment over the oil spill though , argues kraft , may not be how many people attend a rally , but whether the disaster affects change .
" i think you will see some real public policy changes .
almost certainly there will be very substantial increases in environmental and safety restrictions . "
and , add the experts , one of the most important things to do is to make sure that companies like bp have a very strong financial interest in ensuring that something like this never happens again .
this process has already begun , notes kraft : " the price of bp stock has plummeted since the disaster by something like 40 percent or $ 73 billion -lrb- 60 billion euros -rrb- . so the reaction here may be a little more subtle than it is in europe . "

" i think you will see some real public policy changes .
almost certainly there will be very substantial increases in environmental and safety restrictions . "
and , add the experts , one of the most important things to do is to make sure that companies like bp have a very strong financial interest in ensuring that something like this never happens again .
this process has already begun , notes kraft : " the price of bp stock has plummeted since the disaster by something like 40 percent or $ 73 billion -lrb- 60 billion euros -rrb- . so the reaction here may be a little more subtle than it is in europe . "

the ministers reviewed a statement that would have iceland start formal accession talks , despite an outstanding dispute with britain and the netherlands surrounding the 2008 failure of the bank icesave .
the british and dutch governments have demanded iceland pay some of the 3.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- in deposits that they gave to clients in their respective countries who lost money in the icelandic bank .
the netherlands and the uk had threatened to block iceland 's entry talks , but british foreign secretary william hague said he had received assurance that iceland intended to pay its fair share .
" the united kingdom will not block the start of iceland 's accession negotiations , " he told reporters in luxembourg on monday .
" but we will want it to be clear as they start that process that iceland is committed to resolving its financial and legal obligations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has reportedly stepped up its search for mladic iceland hopes to achieve eu membership after a speedy 12 to 24 months of accession talks .
while it was once largely skeptical about the eu , it applied for membership in 2009 after its large banking sector was crippled by the global financial crisis .
long road for serbia another country to move closer to eu membership monday was serbia , although the balkan state has a longer road ahead of it than iceland .
the foreign ministers agreed to implement with serbia the stabilization and association agreement , an aid and trade agreement that is recognized as the first official step to full eu membership .
the decision was reportedly based on serbia 's improved cooperation with the united nations-sponsored international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
the court 's chief prosecutor , serge brammertz , briefed the ministers on serbia 's efforts to search out an capture indicted genocide suspect ratko mladic .
but british foreign secretary hague added that there is still " no positive news about the arrest , " and that " serbia has not completed its task . "
serbia formally submitted its bid to join the eu last december .
it is likely to face years of preparations , including democratic and economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western powers fear iran is building a nuclear bomb iran sanctions the wide-ranging foreign ministers meeting also reached a deal on recommending a package of sanctions against iran for its controversial nuclear program , which the west claims is to build a nuclear bomb and iran claims is for civilian purposes .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle called the sanctions , which could be enacted as early as june 26 , " an important signal of determination " to the iranian leadership .
" we wanted to show that we are not only supporting the international community , but that we europeans can make our own contribution to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear weapons , " he said .
the sanctions reportedly go further than those imposed by the un security council last wednesday , targeting trade and the transportation and financial sectors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : oil spill in the gulf of mexico the oil disaster the world prefers to ignore bp oil spill must have global consequences , says former un expert obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist full oil spill compensation looks increasingly unlikely disasters -pipe- 15.06.2010 americans vent anger over oil spill differently from europeans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a lack of mass protests by fishermen in the gulf states compared to earlier oil disasters in europe where thousands took to the streets , the outcry in the us over the bp spill seems rather restrained .
but the lack of mass rallies should n't be seen as a lack of public anger . when the oil tanker erika sank and broke apart off the french coast in december 1999 , the public was outraged .
an estimated crowd of 20,000 demonstrated at a rally in nantes against french oil giant total whose leased vessel had spilled approximately three million gallons of oil .
the disaster killed as many as 75,000 birds and spoiled around 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- of the coast .
three years later when the oil tanker prestige sank off the galician coast causing spain 's biggest environmental catastrophe in history , the spaniards took the the streets as well .
at least 12,000 demonstrators gathered at one rally in barcelona alone to voice their anger over the crisis management of the spanish government .
the prestige 's spill of around 20 million gallons of oil contaminated large parts of the french and spanish coasts .
the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico dwarfs both the erika and prestige disasters .
according to recent revised estimates the deepwater horizon rig has already leaked between 42 and 100 million gallons into the water with no end in sight .
that means the bp leak is causing a spill the size of the exxon valez disaster every five to 13 days .
it is by far the worst environmental disaster in us history .
few protestors at bp headquarters and yet after weeks of uninterrupted spilling , a recent rally at bp 's washington headquarters according to media reports attracted only a few dozen protesters .
a protest event in new orleans , which is directly affected by the spill , also drew only some 200 people according to media reports . " that 's not the us style , " michael e. kraft , professor of public and environmental affairs at the university of wisconsin-green bay , told deutsche welle .
" people do n't protest like that over almost anything .
but i would n't take that to mean that there is a lack of public concern . "
his colleague christoph goerg , an expert for global environmental governance at the leipzig-based helmholtz centre for environmental research , agrees : " i do n't think that the environmental consciousness in the us is generally less-developed than in europe . "
goerg believes that the absence of mass gatherings is a characteristic of the political culture in the us and the ability and the willingness of the people to articulate themselves publicly .
" what is definitely different especially compared to france , but also spain , is that in those countries there are very strong lobby groups of fishermen , but also farmers who are able not only to articulate themselves , but also to organize the people most affected by the spill and give them a public platform . " opinion polls show frustration of crisis management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of spaniards demonstrated after the prestige disaster while americans may not flock to the streets , numerous opinion surveys show that the us public is in fact deeply worried about the disaster .
seventy percent of americans , according to one poll , disapprove of bp 's handling of the crisis .
president barack obama 's crisis management has also been heavily criticized .
there are also indications of a significant shift in public opinion over offshore drilling .
in florida , one of the worst affected states , according to a new poll 51 percent of floridians now oppose new offshore drilling .
before the disaster 66 percent were in favor of drilling and only 27 against it .
but is there no way to gauge the public sentiment beyond mere surveys ?
sure , say the experts .
just log on to the internet or turn on the television .
since the explosion on the oil rig , news crews are present covering the spill around the clock .
comedians like bill maher and jon stewart have targeted bp and the obama administration repeatedly .
and in the gulf states many locals have displayed placards and posters showing their frustration over bp , but also over the government 's response .
anti-bp art on the internet on the internet new groups and websites devoted to the disaster are springing up every day .
one of the biggest ones , the boycott bp group on facebook , attracts thousands of new supporters daily and currently has more than 600,000 fans .
and at the popular blog huffington post readers can vent their anger with anti-bp art .
" the public sphere is not the street alone anymore , but also the internet with its various media outlets , " explains goerg .
" a lot of public discourse is carried out over the internet in a new kind of way that also creates new forms of publicity . "
bildunterschrift : oil companies like bp face tougher regulations and higher liability this , argues goerg , has both positive and negative aspects .
" when one attends a rally with others this is something different than when one is active on twitter or voices an opinion somewhere else on the internet , " he says .
" that is more difficult during a public rally , but on the other hand , the connection with others is stronger and one feels more like being part of a group . " the most important benchmark for the effectiveness of public sentiment over the oil spill though , argues kraft , may not be how many people attend a rally , but whether the disaster affects change .
" i think you will see some real public policy changes .
almost certainly there will be very substantial increases in environmental and safety restrictions . "
and , add the experts , one of the most important things to do is to make sure that companies like bp have a very strong financial interest in ensuring that something like this never happens again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : oil spill in the gulf of mexico the oil disaster the world prefers to ignore bp oil spill must have global consequences , says former un expert obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist full oil spill compensation looks increasingly unlikely disasters -pipe- 15.06.2010 americans vent anger over oil spill differently from europeans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a lack of mass protests by fishermen in the gulf states compared to earlier oil disasters in europe where thousands took to the streets , the outcry in the us over the bp spill seems rather restrained .
but the lack of mass rallies should n't be seen as a lack of public anger . when the oil tanker erika sank and broke apart off the french coast in december 1999 , the public was outraged .
an estimated crowd of 20,000 demonstrated at a rally in nantes against french oil giant total whose leased vessel had spilled approximately three million gallons of oil .
the disaster killed as many as 75,000 birds and spoiled around 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- of the coast .
three years later when the oil tanker prestige sank off the galician coast causing spain 's biggest environmental catastrophe in history , the spaniards took the the streets as well .
at least 12,000 demonstrators gathered at one rally in barcelona alone to voice their anger over the crisis management of the spanish government .
the prestige 's spill of around 20 million gallons of oil contaminated large parts of the french and spanish coasts .
the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico dwarfs both the erika and prestige disasters .
according to recent revised estimates the deepwater horizon rig has already leaked between 42 and 100 million gallons into the water with no end in sight .
that means the bp leak is causing a spill the size of the exxon valez disaster every five to 13 days .
it is by far the worst environmental disaster in us history .
few protestors at bp headquarters and yet after weeks of uninterrupted spilling , a recent rally at bp 's washington headquarters according to media reports attracted only a few dozen protesters .
a protest event in new orleans , which is directly affected by the spill , also drew only some 200 people according to media reports . " that 's not the us style , " michael e. kraft , professor of public and environmental affairs at the university of wisconsin-green bay , told deutsche welle .
" people do n't protest like that over almost anything .
but i would n't take that to mean that there is a lack of public concern . "
his colleague christoph goerg , an expert for global environmental governance at the leipzig-based helmholtz centre for environmental research , agrees : " i do n't think that the environmental consciousness in the us is generally less-developed than in europe . "
goerg believes that the absence of mass gatherings is a characteristic of the political culture in the us and the ability and the willingness of the people to articulate themselves publicly .
" what is definitely different especially compared to france , but also spain , is that in those countries there are very strong lobby groups of fishermen , but also farmers who are able not only to articulate themselves , but also to organize the people most affected by the spill and give them a public platform . " opinion polls show frustration of crisis management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of spaniards demonstrated after the prestige disaster while americans may not flock to the streets , numerous opinion surveys show that the us public is in fact deeply worried about the disaster .
seventy percent of americans , according to one poll , disapprove of bp 's handling of the crisis .
president barack obama 's crisis management has also been heavily criticized .
there are also indications of a significant shift in public opinion over offshore drilling .
in florida , one of the worst affected states , according to a new poll 51 percent of floridians now oppose new offshore drilling .
before the disaster 66 percent were in favor of drilling and only 27 against it .
but is there no way to gauge the public sentiment beyond mere surveys ?
sure , say the experts .
just log on to the internet or turn on the television .
since the explosion on the oil rig , news crews are present covering the spill around the clock .
comedians like bill maher and jon stewart have targeted bp and the obama administration repeatedly .
and in the gulf states many locals have displayed placards and posters showing their frustration over bp , but also over the government 's response .
anti-bp art on the internet on the internet new groups and websites devoted to the disaster are springing up every day .
one of the biggest ones , the boycott bp group on facebook , attracts thousands of new supporters daily and currently has more than 600,000 fans .
and at the popular blog huffington post readers can vent their anger with anti-bp art .
" the public sphere is not the street alone anymore , but also the internet with its various media outlets , " explains goerg .
" a lot of public discourse is carried out over the internet in a new kind of way that also creates new forms of publicity . "
bildunterschrift : oil companies like bp face tougher regulations and higher liability this , argues goerg , has both positive and negative aspects .
" when one attends a rally with others this is something different than when one is active on twitter or voices an opinion somewhere else on the internet , " he says .
" that is more difficult during a public rally , but on the other hand , the connection with others is stronger and one feels more like being part of a group . " the most important benchmark for the effectiveness of public sentiment over the oil spill though , argues kraft , may not be how many people attend a rally , but whether the disaster affects change .
" i think you will see some real public policy changes .
almost certainly there will be very substantial increases in environmental and safety restrictions . "
and , add the experts , one of the most important things to do is to make sure that companies like bp have a very strong financial interest in ensuring that something like this never happens again .
this process has already begun , notes kraft : " the price of bp stock has plummeted since the disaster by something like 40 percent or $ 73 billion -lrb- 60 billion euros -rrb- . so the reaction here may be a little more subtle than it is in europe . "

but at home , it 's struggling to juggle powerful business interests with efforts to protect its threatened rainforest . brazil is considered one of the key countries in global efforts to protect the climate .
the destruction of the rain forest alone is said to be responsible for around half of brazil 's greenhouse gas emissions .
the latin american country is the world 's fifth-largest polluter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of the chainsaw is increasingly part of daily life in the rainforest brazil 's president luiz inacio lula da silva reportedly wants to reduce the amount of amazon rain forest being cleared by 80 percent by 2020 .
but lula insists that the main responsibility for sustainable climate protection lies with the united nations .
following the failure of global climate talks in copenhagen last december , lula reportedly urged un secretary-general ban ki moon during a private meeting to press for a global agreement .
lula said the un is the right forum for discussions about climate change .
controversial dam project lula 's policy on protecting the environment and the rain forest became apparent in early february when brazil 's environment agency ibama approved the construction of a controversial hydro-electric dam belo monte in the middle of the amazon rain forest .
when it is completed , belo monte will be the third largest hydro-electric dam in the world , after the three gorges in china and itaipu , which is jointly run by brazil and paraguay .
it is expected to provide electricity to 23 million brazilian homes .
but residents as well as environmental activists have protested the building of the mega dam in the brazilian state of para .
the justice ministry in para has even tried to prevent the project but lula 's government has stood firm and pushed the project , estimated to cost billions .
construction is slated to begin later in 2010 - a year in which brazil holds general elections .
some 20,000 indigenous people are to be resettled and some 516 square kilometers -lrb- 199 square miles -rrb- of rain forest are to be flooded for the dam 's construction .
business interests damaging rain forest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainforest is being cleared away to make room for lucrative cattle ranching despite pledges by lula 's government to protect the rain forest and the global climate , tree-cutting and the clearing of forests to make way for pastures and cultivation of fields is continuing .
it 's no surprise considering that one of brazil 's leading exports includes beef used in burgers in fast food chains around the world .
that has made cattle ranching more profitable for farmers and encouraged them to deforest .
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations -lrb- fao -rrb- said in march that these business interests have led brazil to sacrifice an average of 26,000 square kilometers -lrb- 10,040 square miles -rrb- of forest each year in the past decade .
the rapid pace of deforestation has done irreparable damage to the so-called " air conditioner " of the world , as environmental activists call the rainforest .
the amazon acts as a " carbon sink , " absorbing carbon dioxide but once the trees are cut down , this absorption stops .
often the wood is burned , releasing carbon , and the loss of forest cover can also lead to carbon release from the soil .
the forest also releases enough water to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration to influence world climate patterns .
a ray of hope the gtz , a german state-owned organization working for sustainable development worldwide , says that the environment laws passed in brazil so far ca n't stop the destruction of the country 's tropical forests .
it estimates that around 680,000 square kilometers -lrb- 262,550 square miles -rrb- of rain forest in the amazon or 17 percent of its original area has been destroyed so far .
along the atlantic coast , just seven percent of rain forest has been preserved .
bildunterschrift : comparative satellite images highlight the extent of the damage in the brazilian state of rondonia the project " amazon region protected area " -lrb- arpa -rrb- , which is supported by germany , provides a ray of hope .
it was founded by lula 's predecessor fernando henrique cardoso who , in 1998 , vowed to designate 12 percent of the rain forest as an officially protected zone by 2012 .
that has now been postponed to 2016 and there are plans to declare the entire 600,000 square kilometers -lrb- 231,660 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest as a protected zone by then .
some progress has already been made .
so far around 390,000 square kilometers -lrb- 150,580 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest has been marked as a federally-protected zone .
but the gtz says that only half of that - just four percent of the amazon rain forest - is strictly protected . that 's too less , according to the group .
critics trace the lowest rate of deforestation in 2009 to the global financial crisis .
" the demand for beef , soya and wood has dramatically fallen , " paulo adario of greenpeace said .
but he added that slowing deforestation has little to do with efforts to protect the climate .
that means in the worst-case scenario , the brazilian rainforest faces another wave of erosion as soon as world markets begin clamoring for brazil 's exports again .

controversial dam project lula 's policy on protecting the environment and the rain forest became apparent in early february when brazil 's environment agency ibama approved the construction of a controversial hydro-electric dam belo monte in the middle of the amazon rain forest .
when it is completed , belo monte will be the third largest hydro-electric dam in the world , after the three gorges in china and itaipu , which is jointly run by brazil and paraguay .
it is expected to provide electricity to 23 million brazilian homes .

it 's no surprise considering that one of brazil 's leading exports includes beef used in burgers in fast food chains around the world .
that has made cattle ranching more profitable for farmers and encouraged them to deforest .
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations -lrb- fao -rrb- said in march that these business interests have led brazil to sacrifice an average of 26,000 square kilometers -lrb- 10,040 square miles -rrb- of forest each year in the past decade .
the rapid pace of deforestation has done irreparable damage to the so-called " air conditioner " of the world , as environmental activists call the rainforest .
the amazon acts as a " carbon sink , " absorbing carbon dioxide but once the trees are cut down , this absorption stops .

speaking during a debate in the european parliament in strasbourg , rehn said that the decision to cut greece 's rating was both " surprising " and " unfortunate " at a time when eu and imf auditors were taking a hard look at the country 's attempts to slash its debt .
the eu commissioner said that the downgrade , which he had discussed with financial services commissioner michel barnier and european commission president jose manuel barroso , " again raises issues related to the role of credit rating agencies in the financial system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn says the credit rating industry needs a shake-up rehn said that the eu commission , which is seeking to regulate ratings agencies under new reforms due to be implemented in 2011 , will probe " the level of competition in the sector " and fears that a lack of transparency could represent a " conflict of interest . "
not everyone surprised but many financial experts say the downgrade by moody 's was not totally unexpected given that rival ratings agency standard and poor 's downgraded greece 's sovereign debt to junk status in april , while fitch , the other major ratings agency , warned weeks later that it , too , may follow .
" nothing has really changed since then , " said alcidi cinzia , a research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
" the agency has just put down on paper what the market has been thinking for some time , " she told deutsche welle .
questionable creditworthiness in a statement issued monday , moody 's justified its decision to lower greece 's creditworthiness rating by four notches from a3 to ba1 by pointing to considerable market uncertainty surrounding the country 's plans to reduce its huge debt and balance its finances – even with the help of the eu-imf bailout package .
moody 's describes the ba1 rating as below investment grade - or " junk " status in market parlance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister george papandreou has been facing some tough questions the downgrade means some investors will no longer be allowed to buy greek debt under the terms of their investment mandate and could lead to still higher borrowing costs for athens if it goes to the markets for cash .
observers agree that the downgrade is yet another blow to the debt-ridden country , which is under intense international scrutiny .
last month , it narrowly avoided default after the european union and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- agreed to intervene with a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- bailout .
the bailout from the eu and the imf means that greece is highly unlikely to default in the short term , if at all .
and it gives the country a few years to get its fiscal act together .
cut spending , promote growth but the bailout is a loan - not a gift - meaning that it adds to greece 's debt .
to climb out of trouble , the country will need to cut spending and , at the same time , grow its economy .
while experts agree this will be a difficult trick to pull off , the greek government has been trying hard to promote confidence in its plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks protest the government 's sweeping austerity program so , understandably , officials in athens were n't happy with moody 's call , especially its timing .
shortly after the ratings agency released its statement , the greek ministry of finance fired off it own .
" moody 's downgrade of greek government bonds today does not reflect in any way greece 's progress over the past months , " the ministry wrote .
" nor does it reflect the potential created by the country 's effort of fiscal consolidation and increased competitiveness . "
" greece is moving ahead with all the reforms stipulated in the memorandum of understanding , -lrb- and -rrb- for many of these reforms , it is already ahead of schedule . "

speaking during a debate in the european parliament in strasbourg , rehn said that the decision to cut greece 's rating was both " surprising " and " unfortunate " at a time when eu and imf auditors were taking a hard look at the country 's attempts to slash its debt .
the eu commissioner said that the downgrade , which he had discussed with financial services commissioner michel barnier and european commission president jose manuel barroso , " again raises issues related to the role of credit rating agencies in the financial system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn says the credit rating industry needs a shake-up rehn said that the eu commission , which is seeking to regulate ratings agencies under new reforms due to be implemented in 2011 , will probe " the level of competition in the sector " and fears that a lack of transparency could represent a " conflict of interest . "
not everyone surprised but many financial experts say the downgrade by moody 's was not totally unexpected given that rival ratings agency standard and poor 's downgraded greece 's sovereign debt to junk status in april , while fitch , the other major ratings agency , warned weeks later that it , too , may follow .
" nothing has really changed since then , " said alcidi cinzia , a research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
" the agency has just put down on paper what the market has been thinking for some time , " she told deutsche welle .
questionable creditworthiness in a statement issued monday , moody 's justified its decision to lower greece 's creditworthiness rating by four notches from a3 to ba1 by pointing to considerable market uncertainty surrounding the country 's plans to reduce its huge debt and balance its finances – even with the help of the eu-imf bailout package .
moody 's describes the ba1 rating as below investment grade - or " junk " status in market parlance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister george papandreou has been facing some tough questions the downgrade means some investors will no longer be allowed to buy greek debt under the terms of their investment mandate and could lead to still higher borrowing costs for athens if it goes to the markets for cash .
observers agree that the downgrade is yet another blow to the debt-ridden country , which is under intense international scrutiny .
last month , it narrowly avoided default after the european union and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- agreed to intervene with a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- bailout .
the bailout from the eu and the imf means that greece is highly unlikely to default in the short term , if at all .
and it gives the country a few years to get its fiscal act together .
cut spending , promote growth but the bailout is a loan - not a gift - meaning that it adds to greece 's debt .
to climb out of trouble , the country will need to cut spending and , at the same time , grow its economy .
while experts agree this will be a difficult trick to pull off , the greek government has been trying hard to promote confidence in its plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks protest the government 's sweeping austerity program so , understandably , officials in athens were n't happy with moody 's call , especially its timing .
shortly after the ratings agency released its statement , the greek ministry of finance fired off it own .
" moody 's downgrade of greek government bonds today does not reflect in any way greece 's progress over the past months , " the ministry wrote .
" nor does it reflect the potential created by the country 's effort of fiscal consolidation and increased competitiveness . "
" greece is moving ahead with all the reforms stipulated in the memorandum of understanding , -lrb- and -rrb- for many of these reforms , it is already ahead of schedule . "

but at home , it 's struggling to juggle powerful business interests with efforts to protect its threatened rainforest . brazil is considered one of the key countries in global efforts to protect the climate .
the destruction of the rain forest alone is said to be responsible for around half of brazil 's greenhouse gas emissions .
the latin american country is the world 's fifth-largest polluter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of the chainsaw is increasingly part of daily life in the rainforest brazil 's president luiz inacio lula da silva reportedly wants to reduce the amount of amazon rain forest being cleared by 80 percent by 2020 .
but lula insists that the main responsibility for sustainable climate protection lies with the united nations .
following the failure of global climate talks in copenhagen last december , lula reportedly urged un secretary-general ban ki moon during a private meeting to press for a global agreement .
lula said the un is the right forum for discussions about climate change .
controversial dam project lula 's policy on protecting the environment and the rain forest became apparent in early february when brazil 's environment agency ibama approved the construction of a controversial hydro-electric dam belo monte in the middle of the amazon rain forest .
when it is completed , belo monte will be the third largest hydro-electric dam in the world , after the three gorges in china and itaipu , which is jointly run by brazil and paraguay .
it is expected to provide electricity to 23 million brazilian homes .
but residents as well as environmental activists have protested the building of the mega dam in the brazilian state of para .
the justice ministry in para has even tried to prevent the project but lula 's government has stood firm and pushed the project , estimated to cost billions .
construction is slated to begin later in 2010 - a year in which brazil holds general elections .
some 20,000 indigenous people are to be resettled and some 516 square kilometers -lrb- 199 square miles -rrb- of rain forest are to be flooded for the dam 's construction .
business interests damaging rain forest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainforest is being cleared away to make room for lucrative cattle ranching despite pledges by lula 's government to protect the rain forest and the global climate , tree-cutting and the clearing of forests to make way for pastures and cultivation of fields is continuing .
it 's no surprise considering that one of brazil 's leading exports includes beef used in burgers in fast food chains around the world .
that has made cattle ranching more profitable for farmers and encouraged them to deforest .
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations -lrb- fao -rrb- said in march that these business interests have led brazil to sacrifice an average of 26,000 square kilometers -lrb- 10,040 square miles -rrb- of forest each year in the past decade .
the rapid pace of deforestation has done irreparable damage to the so-called " air conditioner " of the world , as environmental activists call the rainforest .
the amazon acts as a " carbon sink , " absorbing carbon dioxide but once the trees are cut down , this absorption stops .
often the wood is burned , releasing carbon , and the loss of forest cover can also lead to carbon release from the soil .
the forest also releases enough water to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration to influence world climate patterns .
a ray of hope the gtz , a german state-owned organization working for sustainable development worldwide , says that the environment laws passed in brazil so far ca n't stop the destruction of the country 's tropical forests .
it estimates that around 680,000 square kilometers -lrb- 262,550 square miles -rrb- of rain forest in the amazon or 17 percent of its original area has been destroyed so far .
along the atlantic coast , just seven percent of rain forest has been preserved .
bildunterschrift : comparative satellite images highlight the extent of the damage in the brazilian state of rondonia the project " amazon region protected area " -lrb- arpa -rrb- , which is supported by germany , provides a ray of hope .
it was founded by lula 's predecessor fernando henrique cardoso who , in 1998 , vowed to designate 12 percent of the rain forest as an officially protected zone by 2012 .
that has now been postponed to 2016 and there are plans to declare the entire 600,000 square kilometers -lrb- 231,660 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest as a protected zone by then .
some progress has already been made .
so far around 390,000 square kilometers -lrb- 150,580 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest has been marked as a federally-protected zone .
but the gtz says that only half of that - just four percent of the amazon rain forest - is strictly protected . that 's too less , according to the group .
critics trace the lowest rate of deforestation in 2009 to the global financial crisis .
" the demand for beef , soya and wood has dramatically fallen , " paulo adario of greenpeace said .
but he added that slowing deforestation has little to do with efforts to protect the climate .
that means in the worst-case scenario , the brazilian rainforest faces another wave of erosion as soon as world markets begin clamoring for brazil 's exports again .

the ministers reviewed a statement that would have iceland start formal accession talks , despite an outstanding dispute with britain and the netherlands surrounding the 2008 failure of the bank icesave .
the british and dutch governments have demanded iceland pay some of the 3.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- in deposits that they gave to clients in their respective countries who lost money in the icelandic bank .
the netherlands and the uk had threatened to block iceland 's entry talks , but british foreign secretary william hague said he had received assurance that iceland intended to pay its fair share .
" the united kingdom will not block the start of iceland 's accession negotiations , " he told reporters in luxembourg on monday .
" but we will want it to be clear as they start that process that iceland is committed to resolving its financial and legal obligations . "

while it was once largely skeptical about the eu , it applied for membership in 2009 after its large banking sector was crippled by the global financial crisis .
long road for serbia another country to move closer to eu membership monday was serbia , although the balkan state has a longer road ahead of it than iceland .
the foreign ministers agreed to implement with serbia the stabilization and association agreement , an aid and trade agreement that is recognized as the first official step to full eu membership .
the decision was reportedly based on serbia 's improved cooperation with the united nations-sponsored international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
the court 's chief prosecutor , serge brammertz , briefed the ministers on serbia 's efforts to search out an capture indicted genocide suspect ratko mladic .
but british foreign secretary hague added that there is still " no positive news about the arrest , " and that " serbia has not completed its task . "
serbia formally submitted its bid to join the eu last december .
it is likely to face years of preparations , including democratic and economic reforms .

german foreign minister guido westerwelle called the sanctions , which could be enacted as early as june 26 , " an important signal of determination " to the iranian leadership .
" we wanted to show that we are not only supporting the international community , but that we europeans can make our own contribution to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear weapons , " he said .
the sanctions reportedly go further than those imposed by the un security council last wednesday , targeting trade and the transportation and financial sectors .

the information implicates as many as 4,450 people with accounts with ubs . swiss lawmakers have backed a deal with the us that would see banking giant ubs forced to hand over data on 4,450 us clients suspected of tax evasion .
the swiss and us governments , along with switzerland 's largest bank ubs , had agreed the deal in 2009 , but it needed parliamentary approval after the swiss supreme court called its legality into question .
switzerland has long faced criticism from the international community over its secretive banking laws that protect the identities of account holders with banks such as ubs .
last week it seemed the deal may have been dead in the water after parties from across the political spectrum in switzerland voted against the government-brokered agreement .
approval of the deal - by 81 votes to 61 , with 53 lawmakers abstaining - was reached after the lower house was asked to hold a second vote .
technical details remain to be ironed out and the proposal may still be put to the swiss public in a referendum before it finally becomes law .
approval of the deal could go a long way to settling lawsuits by us authorities and could save switzerland and several of its banks considerable sums of money in legal fees .

group g. and though brazil are favored , no one knows what the table will look like in the end . when ivory coast kick off against portugal on tuesday afternoon , a tournament that 's thus far been somewhat short of highlights will probably shift up a gear .
together with the selecao and north korea , those two squads comprise one of the strongest , and certainly the strangest , " group of death " in world cup history .
there are compelling storylines galore : a former colonial power up against an ersatz colony , the top soccer nation on the planet taking on the world 's most secretive country , two of the sport 's top stars bidding for elusive international success , and the top team in africa trying to measure up to the best of south america .
one thing is clear .
of brazil , portugal and ivory coast , at least one team will be making an early exit .
and which team that is could come down to an intriguing joker thrown into the deck , north korea .
worries , real or feigned bildunterschrift : brazil remain the favorites all coaches of teams that are heavily favored mouth pieties about the need to respect every opponent .
but brazil 's coach carlos dunga does seem to be taking the selecao 's opening match against north korea surprisingly seriously , closing several of the team 's final practices to the public .
brazil breezed through qualifying , but this is not the same sort of team fans are used to seeing from south america 's largest nation .
dunga has emphasized tactical solidity over technical flash , leaving stars such as ronaldinho out of the squad .
the selecao still have a surfeit of talent , of course , with forward robinho and midfield general kaka both fit and capable of scoring the goals brazil need .
still , brazil 's players are sticking to the humble script .
" when we look at history , brazil may have many more titles than they do , but once the match starts we will need to have the same respect as we would have to any other team , " midfielder elano told germany 's dpa news agency ahead of the match with north korea .
and legendary former brazil player socrates told the bbc before the start of tournament that they were fielding a too-workmanlike squad of players with questionable fitness , and predicted the selecao would have difficulties in the group stage .
astonishingly , it 's been the underdogs doing most of the big talking .
the asian wayne rooney bildunterschrift : the man on the right is considered the asian wayne north korea have only taken part in one previous world cup , and that was back in 1966 - although they did score a shocking upset of italy in the group stage .
but their coach kim jong-hun says the outsiders do indeed have a chance in the toughest of all groups .
" in football , the best teams do n't necessarily win , " kim told the afp news agency .
" we will give it our best .
we know we need to win to reach the knockout phase , so no matter who we 're up against , we 'll target the three points . "
almost the entire squad plays its football in the domestic north korean league .
but striker jong tae-se plies his trade in japan , where he has become known as the " asian wayne rooney . "
" the match will be very difficult , but we can beat brazil , " jong told dpa .
" our team has a mentality similar to the german one , which is the best in the world . "
anticipation is making him wait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drogba is working hard on his comeback ahead of the ivory coast-portugal clash , much of the attention has focussed on two superstars .
ivory coast are hoping that striker didier drogba can recover from a fractured elbow picked up in a pre-tournament friendly .
his status is touch-and-go .
but even if les elephants have to do without their top scorer , the players think they ' ve gained enough discipline under new coach sven-goran eriksson to get the results that have eluded them in the past .
" we 've always had good players but have never been able to properly work together as an effective unit , defending and attacking as one , " ivory coast defender kolo toure told dpa .
" that 's what we 've been working on , and we hope that it will bear fruit , starting with our first match versus portugal . "
on the other side , portugal hope their superstar , cristiano ronaldo , the 2008-09 footballer of the year , can end a 16-month scoreless streak in international competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo is keeping his head up but cr7 would n't be cr7 , if he lacked confidence .
" it 's like a great player once told me , goals are like ketchup , " ronaldo told dpa .
" you keep on forcing it , then it comes all at once . "
portugese fans better hope the ketchup starts flowing because scoring goals - lots of them - may be the key to surviving this group .
the tie-breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group could be a lottery in the end in a group this tight , it 's entirely possible that two teams might end up level on points in second place in the final table .
according to the rules laid out by football 's world governing body fifa , goal difference is to be used to break any ties .
and that would make an 8-nil thrashing of north korea , for instance , of enormous value .
even stranger would be the scenario if three teams ended up level on points .
the goal-difference rule applies there as well , but there has considerable confusion about precisely how it , and other rules , would be applied in this unlikely but possible scenario .
if else fails , the decision will be made by flipping a coin .
that is extremely , extremely unlikely , but anything could happen in a group of death with more than its fair share of oddities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 15.06.2010 eu commission slams us rating agency over greek ' junk ' status großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moody 's junk rating comes at a bad time for greece the european union 's top economic commissioner olli rehn has criticised moody 's rating agency for downgrading greece 's debt rating as the athens government struggles to solve the country 's huge national debt . the european union commissioner for economic affairs , olli rehn , has criticized the us-based rating agency moody 's for slashing its sovereign debt rating for greece to " junk " status .
speaking during a debate in the european parliament in strasbourg , rehn said that the decision to cut greece 's rating was both " surprising " and " unfortunate " at a time when eu and imf auditors were taking a hard look at the country 's attempts to slash its debt .
the eu commissioner said that the downgrade , which he had discussed with financial services commissioner michel barnier and european commission president jose manuel barroso , " again raises issues related to the role of credit rating agencies in the financial system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn says the credit rating industry needs a shake-up rehn said that the eu commission , which is seeking to regulate ratings agencies under new reforms due to be implemented in 2011 , will probe " the level of competition in the sector " and fears that a lack of transparency could represent a " conflict of interest . "
not everyone surprised but many financial experts say the downgrade by moody 's was not totally unexpected given that rival ratings agency standard and poor 's downgraded greece 's sovereign debt to junk status in april , while fitch , the other major ratings agency , warned weeks later that it , too , may follow .
" nothing has really changed since then , " said alcidi cinzia , a research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
" the agency has just put down on paper what the market has been thinking for some time , " she told deutsche welle .
questionable creditworthiness in a statement issued monday , moody 's justified its decision to lower greece 's creditworthiness rating by four notches from a3 to ba1 by pointing to considerable market uncertainty surrounding the country 's plans to reduce its huge debt and balance its finances – even with the help of the eu-imf bailout package .
moody 's describes the ba1 rating as below investment grade - or " junk " status in market parlance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister george papandreou has been facing some tough questions the downgrade means some investors will no longer be allowed to buy greek debt under the terms of their investment mandate and could lead to still higher borrowing costs for athens if it goes to the markets for cash .
observers agree that the downgrade is yet another blow to the debt-ridden country , which is under intense international scrutiny .
last month , it narrowly avoided default after the european union and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- agreed to intervene with a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- bailout .
the bailout from the eu and the imf means that greece is highly unlikely to default in the short term , if at all .
and it gives the country a few years to get its fiscal act together .
cut spending , promote growth but the bailout is a loan - not a gift - meaning that it adds to greece 's debt .
to climb out of trouble , the country will need to cut spending and , at the same time , grow its economy .
while experts agree this will be a difficult trick to pull off , the greek government has been trying hard to promote confidence in its plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks protest the government 's sweeping austerity program so , understandably , officials in athens were n't happy with moody 's call , especially its timing .
shortly after the ratings agency released its statement , the greek ministry of finance fired off it own .
" moody 's downgrade of greek government bonds today does not reflect in any way greece 's progress over the past months , " the ministry wrote .
" nor does it reflect the potential created by the country 's effort of fiscal consolidation and increased competitiveness . "
" greece is moving ahead with all the reforms stipulated in the memorandum of understanding , -lrb- and -rrb- for many of these reforms , it is already ahead of schedule . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : oil spill in the gulf of mexico the oil disaster the world prefers to ignore bp oil spill must have global consequences , says former un expert obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist full oil spill compensation looks increasingly unlikely disasters -pipe- 15.06.2010 americans vent anger over oil spill differently from europeans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a lack of mass protests by fishermen in the gulf states compared to earlier oil disasters in europe where thousands took to the streets , the outcry in the us over the bp spill seems rather restrained .
but the lack of mass rallies should n't be seen as a lack of public anger . when the oil tanker erika sank and broke apart off the french coast in december 1999 , the public was outraged .
an estimated crowd of 20,000 demonstrated at a rally in nantes against french oil giant total whose leased vessel had spilled approximately three million gallons of oil .
the disaster killed as many as 75,000 birds and spoiled around 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- of the coast .
three years later when the oil tanker prestige sank off the galician coast causing spain 's biggest environmental catastrophe in history , the spaniards took the the streets as well .
at least 12,000 demonstrators gathered at one rally in barcelona alone to voice their anger over the crisis management of the spanish government .
the prestige 's spill of around 20 million gallons of oil contaminated large parts of the french and spanish coasts .
the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico dwarfs both the erika and prestige disasters .
according to recent revised estimates the deepwater horizon rig has already leaked between 42 and 100 million gallons into the water with no end in sight .
that means the bp leak is causing a spill the size of the exxon valez disaster every five to 13 days .
it is by far the worst environmental disaster in us history .
few protestors at bp headquarters and yet after weeks of uninterrupted spilling , a recent rally at bp 's washington headquarters according to media reports attracted only a few dozen protesters .
a protest event in new orleans , which is directly affected by the spill , also drew only some 200 people according to media reports . " that 's not the us style , " michael e. kraft , professor of public and environmental affairs at the university of wisconsin-green bay , told deutsche welle .
" people do n't protest like that over almost anything .
but i would n't take that to mean that there is a lack of public concern . "
his colleague christoph goerg , an expert for global environmental governance at the leipzig-based helmholtz centre for environmental research , agrees : " i do n't think that the environmental consciousness in the us is generally less-developed than in europe . "
goerg believes that the absence of mass gatherings is a characteristic of the political culture in the us and the ability and the willingness of the people to articulate themselves publicly .
" what is definitely different especially compared to france , but also spain , is that in those countries there are very strong lobby groups of fishermen , but also farmers who are able not only to articulate themselves , but also to organize the people most affected by the spill and give them a public platform . " opinion polls show frustration of crisis management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of spaniards demonstrated after the prestige disaster while americans may not flock to the streets , numerous opinion surveys show that the us public is in fact deeply worried about the disaster .
seventy percent of americans , according to one poll , disapprove of bp 's handling of the crisis .
president barack obama 's crisis management has also been heavily criticized .
there are also indications of a significant shift in public opinion over offshore drilling .
in florida , one of the worst affected states , according to a new poll 51 percent of floridians now oppose new offshore drilling .
before the disaster 66 percent were in favor of drilling and only 27 against it .
but is there no way to gauge the public sentiment beyond mere surveys ?
sure , say the experts .
just log on to the internet or turn on the television .
since the explosion on the oil rig , news crews are present covering the spill around the clock .
comedians like bill maher and jon stewart have targeted bp and the obama administration repeatedly .
and in the gulf states many locals have displayed placards and posters showing their frustration over bp , but also over the government 's response .
anti-bp art on the internet on the internet new groups and websites devoted to the disaster are springing up every day .
one of the biggest ones , the boycott bp group on facebook , attracts thousands of new supporters daily and currently has more than 600,000 fans .
and at the popular blog huffington post readers can vent their anger with anti-bp art .
" the public sphere is not the street alone anymore , but also the internet with its various media outlets , " explains goerg .
" a lot of public discourse is carried out over the internet in a new kind of way that also creates new forms of publicity . "
bildunterschrift : oil companies like bp face tougher regulations and higher liability this , argues goerg , has both positive and negative aspects .
" when one attends a rally with others this is something different than when one is active on twitter or voices an opinion somewhere else on the internet , " he says .
" that is more difficult during a public rally , but on the other hand , the connection with others is stronger and one feels more like being part of a group . " the most important benchmark for the effectiveness of public sentiment over the oil spill though , argues kraft , may not be how many people attend a rally , but whether the disaster affects change .
" i think you will see some real public policy changes .
almost certainly there will be very substantial increases in environmental and safety restrictions . "
and , add the experts , one of the most important things to do is to make sure that companies like bp have a very strong financial interest in ensuring that something like this never happens again .
this process has already begun , notes kraft : " the price of bp stock has plummeted since the disaster by something like 40 percent or $ 73 billion -lrb- 60 billion euros -rrb- . so the reaction here may be a little more subtle than it is in europe . "

the information implicates as many as 4,450 people with accounts with ubs . swiss lawmakers have backed a deal with the us that would see banking giant ubs forced to hand over data on 4,450 us clients suspected of tax evasion .
the swiss and us governments , along with switzerland 's largest bank ubs , had agreed the deal in 2009 , but it needed parliamentary approval after the swiss supreme court called its legality into question .
switzerland has long faced criticism from the international community over its secretive banking laws that protect the identities of account holders with banks such as ubs .
last week it seemed the deal may have been dead in the water after parties from across the political spectrum in switzerland voted against the government-brokered agreement .
approval of the deal - by 81 votes to 61 , with 53 lawmakers abstaining - was reached after the lower house was asked to hold a second vote .
technical details remain to be ironed out and the proposal may still be put to the swiss public in a referendum before it finally becomes law .
approval of the deal could go a long way to settling lawsuits by us authorities and could save switzerland and several of its banks considerable sums of money in legal fees .

group g. and though brazil are favored , no one knows what the table will look like in the end . when ivory coast kick off against portugal on tuesday afternoon , a tournament that 's thus far been somewhat short of highlights will probably shift up a gear .
together with the selecao and north korea , those two squads comprise one of the strongest , and certainly the strangest , " group of death " in world cup history .
there are compelling storylines galore : a former colonial power up against an ersatz colony , the top soccer nation on the planet taking on the world 's most secretive country , two of the sport 's top stars bidding for elusive international success , and the top team in africa trying to measure up to the best of south america .
one thing is clear .
of brazil , portugal and ivory coast , at least one team will be making an early exit .
and which team that is could come down to an intriguing joker thrown into the deck , north korea .
worries , real or feigned bildunterschrift : brazil remain the favorites all coaches of teams that are heavily favored mouth pieties about the need to respect every opponent .
but brazil 's coach carlos dunga does seem to be taking the selecao 's opening match against north korea surprisingly seriously , closing several of the team 's final practices to the public .
brazil breezed through qualifying , but this is not the same sort of team fans are used to seeing from south america 's largest nation .
dunga has emphasized tactical solidity over technical flash , leaving stars such as ronaldinho out of the squad .
the selecao still have a surfeit of talent , of course , with forward robinho and midfield general kaka both fit and capable of scoring the goals brazil need .
still , brazil 's players are sticking to the humble script .
" when we look at history , brazil may have many more titles than they do , but once the match starts we will need to have the same respect as we would have to any other team , " midfielder elano told germany 's dpa news agency ahead of the match with north korea .
and legendary former brazil player socrates told the bbc before the start of tournament that they were fielding a too-workmanlike squad of players with questionable fitness , and predicted the selecao would have difficulties in the group stage .
astonishingly , it 's been the underdogs doing most of the big talking .
the asian wayne rooney bildunterschrift : the man on the right is considered the asian wayne north korea have only taken part in one previous world cup , and that was back in 1966 - although they did score a shocking upset of italy in the group stage .
but their coach kim jong-hun says the outsiders do indeed have a chance in the toughest of all groups .
" in football , the best teams do n't necessarily win , " kim told the afp news agency .
" we will give it our best .
we know we need to win to reach the knockout phase , so no matter who we 're up against , we 'll target the three points . "
almost the entire squad plays its football in the domestic north korean league .
but striker jong tae-se plies his trade in japan , where he has become known as the " asian wayne rooney . "
" the match will be very difficult , but we can beat brazil , " jong told dpa .
" our team has a mentality similar to the german one , which is the best in the world . "
anticipation is making him wait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drogba is working hard on his comeback ahead of the ivory coast-portugal clash , much of the attention has focussed on two superstars .
ivory coast are hoping that striker didier drogba can recover from a fractured elbow picked up in a pre-tournament friendly .
his status is touch-and-go .
but even if les elephants have to do without their top scorer , the players think they ' ve gained enough discipline under new coach sven-goran eriksson to get the results that have eluded them in the past .
" we 've always had good players but have never been able to properly work together as an effective unit , defending and attacking as one , " ivory coast defender kolo toure told dpa .
" that 's what we 've been working on , and we hope that it will bear fruit , starting with our first match versus portugal . "
on the other side , portugal hope their superstar , cristiano ronaldo , the 2008-09 footballer of the year , can end a 16-month scoreless streak in international competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo is keeping his head up but cr7 would n't be cr7 , if he lacked confidence .
" it 's like a great player once told me , goals are like ketchup , " ronaldo told dpa .
" you keep on forcing it , then it comes all at once . "
portugese fans better hope the ketchup starts flowing because scoring goals - lots of them - may be the key to surviving this group .
the tie-breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group could be a lottery in the end in a group this tight , it 's entirely possible that two teams might end up level on points in second place in the final table .
according to the rules laid out by football 's world governing body fifa , goal difference is to be used to break any ties .
and that would make an 8-nil thrashing of north korea , for instance , of enormous value .
even stranger would be the scenario if three teams ended up level on points .
the goal-difference rule applies there as well , but there has considerable confusion about precisely how it , and other rules , would be applied in this unlikely but possible scenario .
if else fails , the decision will be made by flipping a coin .
that is extremely , extremely unlikely , but anything could happen in a group of death with more than its fair share of oddities .

although recycling can help protect the environment and save resources , a closer look at the electronic scrap business reveals an extremely harmful industry .
it represents a massive health hazard for those whose job it is to sort out the old computers , cd players and printers from the west . " take a look , no problem . "
harish puts his bare hands into a big plastic container that is filled with a greenish liquid , which is bubbling at the surface .
it turns out to be nitric acid .
it burns the eyes and the nose if you hold your head too close . harish , who works on the outskirts of delhi on an industrial estate that has not been approved by the state , does know that his job could damage his health , especially his respiratory tracts .
but what else can he do , he asks .
he has no qualifications . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large amount of the world 's electronic waste goes to india for recycling dangerous process ravi aggarwal works with the ngo toxics link .
he explains how dangerous the chemical etching process is – anything that can fetch money is put in an acid bath : " it is extremely corrosive , which is the whole idea .
so when you put an epoxy board in it , then it melts away the board and leaves the copper to be stripped and to be recycled .
it can cause very strong burns , and when you throw it out , it will corrode everything around it .
but there are also fumes which come out . " the recyclers then sell on the copper from the electronic scrap that has come from all over the world – often by illegal means , says aggarwal : " all the e-waste that comes in comes in not as e-waste but under other categories or permitted ways , such as ' mixed metal scrap ' .
so we have seen containers and tracked bills of entry , which are customs documents , which contain e-waste .
our estimate is from 50,000 to 60,000 tons of electronic waste per year at least that has come in . " bildunterschrift : a worker sorts electronic equipment for recycling government ambivalent india 's coast is long and there are hardly any controls .
however , recently a scandal erupted when radioactive scrap was found on a garbage heap in the middle of delhi .
the government has promised to take action and laws are currently under debate but ravi aggarwal is skeptical . " it is very easy to stop .
you just have to put scanners at the ports and you can stop it .
but i think there is an ambivalence in government policy , because the government is saying : ok , we do n't want it , but it is good for the economy .
so , all the policy statements have been ambivalent about it .
i think this ambivalence means that they are not really serious about stopping it . " recently , government officials have started appearing at the industrial estate on the outskirts of delhi , a place where there are literally towers of garbage .
they have banned the use of acid baths and the burning of poisonous scrap . however , a man who runs a small recycling business doubts whether people will heed the government 's warnings .
he says he is not worried at all .
anyone whose business is shut down will just be able to move somewhere else .
he is sure that electronic scrap will continue to end up in india . author : kai kuestner / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

group g. and though brazil are favored , no one knows what the table will look like in the end . when ivory coast kick off against portugal on tuesday afternoon , a tournament that 's thus far been somewhat short of highlights will probably shift up a gear .
together with the selecao and north korea , those two squads comprise one of the strongest , and certainly the strangest , " group of death " in world cup history .
there are compelling storylines galore : a former colonial power up against an ersatz colony , the top soccer nation on the planet taking on the world 's most secretive country , two of the sport 's top stars bidding for elusive international success , and the top team in africa trying to measure up to the best of south america .
one thing is clear .
of brazil , portugal and ivory coast , at least one team will be making an early exit .
and which team that is could come down to an intriguing joker thrown into the deck , north korea .
worries , real or feigned bildunterschrift : brazil remain the favorites all coaches of teams that are heavily favored mouth pieties about the need to respect every opponent .
but brazil 's coach carlos dunga does seem to be taking the selecao 's opening match against north korea surprisingly seriously , closing several of the team 's final practices to the public .
brazil breezed through qualifying , but this is not the same sort of team fans are used to seeing from south america 's largest nation .
dunga has emphasized tactical solidity over technical flash , leaving stars such as ronaldinho out of the squad .
the selecao still have a surfeit of talent , of course , with forward robinho and midfield general kaka both fit and capable of scoring the goals brazil need .
still , brazil 's players are sticking to the humble script .
" when we look at history , brazil may have many more titles than they do , but once the match starts we will need to have the same respect as we would have to any other team , " midfielder elano told germany 's dpa news agency ahead of the match with north korea .
and legendary former brazil player socrates told the bbc before the start of tournament that they were fielding a too-workmanlike squad of players with questionable fitness , and predicted the selecao would have difficulties in the group stage .
astonishingly , it 's been the underdogs doing most of the big talking .
the asian wayne rooney bildunterschrift : the man on the right is considered the asian wayne north korea have only taken part in one previous world cup , and that was back in 1966 - although they did score a shocking upset of italy in the group stage .
but their coach kim jong-hun says the outsiders do indeed have a chance in the toughest of all groups .
" in football , the best teams do n't necessarily win , " kim told the afp news agency .
" we will give it our best .
we know we need to win to reach the knockout phase , so no matter who we 're up against , we 'll target the three points . "
almost the entire squad plays its football in the domestic north korean league .
but striker jong tae-se plies his trade in japan , where he has become known as the " asian wayne rooney . "
" the match will be very difficult , but we can beat brazil , " jong told dpa .
" our team has a mentality similar to the german one , which is the best in the world . "

the ministers reviewed a statement that would have iceland start formal accession talks , despite an outstanding dispute with britain and the netherlands surrounding the 2008 failure of the bank icesave .
the british and dutch governments have demanded iceland pay some of the 3.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- in deposits that they gave to clients in their respective countries who lost money in the icelandic bank .
the netherlands and the uk had threatened to block iceland 's entry talks , but british foreign secretary william hague said he had received assurance that iceland intended to pay its fair share .
" the united kingdom will not block the start of iceland 's accession negotiations , " he told reporters in luxembourg on monday .
" but we will want it to be clear as they start that process that iceland is committed to resolving its financial and legal obligations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia has reportedly stepped up its search for mladic iceland hopes to achieve eu membership after a speedy 12 to 24 months of accession talks .
while it was once largely skeptical about the eu , it applied for membership in 2009 after its large banking sector was crippled by the global financial crisis .
long road for serbia another country to move closer to eu membership monday was serbia , although the balkan state has a longer road ahead of it than iceland .
the foreign ministers agreed to implement with serbia the stabilization and association agreement , an aid and trade agreement that is recognized as the first official step to full eu membership .
the decision was reportedly based on serbia 's improved cooperation with the united nations-sponsored international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
the court 's chief prosecutor , serge brammertz , briefed the ministers on serbia 's efforts to search out an capture indicted genocide suspect ratko mladic .
but british foreign secretary hague added that there is still " no positive news about the arrest , " and that " serbia has not completed its task . "
serbia formally submitted its bid to join the eu last december .
it is likely to face years of preparations , including democratic and economic reforms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western powers fear iran is building a nuclear bomb iran sanctions the wide-ranging foreign ministers meeting also reached a deal on recommending a package of sanctions against iran for its controversial nuclear program , which the west claims is to build a nuclear bomb and iran claims is for civilian purposes .
german foreign minister guido westerwelle called the sanctions , which could be enacted as early as june 26 , " an important signal of determination " to the iranian leadership .
" we wanted to show that we are not only supporting the international community , but that we europeans can make our own contribution to prevent iran from acquiring nuclear weapons , " he said .
the sanctions reportedly go further than those imposed by the un security council last wednesday , targeting trade and the transportation and financial sectors .

the information implicates as many as 4,450 people with accounts with ubs . swiss lawmakers have backed a deal with the us that would see banking giant ubs forced to hand over data on 4,450 us clients suspected of tax evasion .
the swiss and us governments , along with switzerland 's largest bank ubs , had agreed the deal in 2009 , but it needed parliamentary approval after the swiss supreme court called its legality into question .
switzerland has long faced criticism from the international community over its secretive banking laws that protect the identities of account holders with banks such as ubs .
last week it seemed the deal may have been dead in the water after parties from across the political spectrum in switzerland voted against the government-brokered agreement .
approval of the deal - by 81 votes to 61 , with 53 lawmakers abstaining - was reached after the lower house was asked to hold a second vote .
technical details remain to be ironed out and the proposal may still be put to the swiss public in a referendum before it finally becomes law .
approval of the deal could go a long way to settling lawsuits by us authorities and could save switzerland and several of its banks considerable sums of money in legal fees .

together with the selecao and north korea , those two squads comprise one of the strongest , and certainly the strangest , " group of death " in world cup history .
there are compelling storylines galore : a former colonial power up against an ersatz colony , the top soccer nation on the planet taking on the world 's most secretive country , two of the sport 's top stars bidding for elusive international success , and the top team in africa trying to measure up to the best of south america .
one thing is clear .

worries , real or feigned bildunterschrift : brazil remain the favorites all coaches of teams that are heavily favored mouth pieties about the need to respect every opponent .

brazil breezed through qualifying , but this is not the same sort of team fans are used to seeing from south america 's largest nation .
dunga has emphasized tactical solidity over technical flash , leaving stars such as ronaldinho out of the squad .
the selecao still have a surfeit of talent , of course , with forward robinho and midfield general kaka both fit and capable of scoring the goals brazil need .

the tie-breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group could be a lottery in the end in a group this tight , it 's entirely possible that two teams might end up level on points in second place in the final table .
according to the rules laid out by football 's world governing body fifa , goal difference is to be used to break any ties .
and that would make an 8-nil thrashing of north korea , for instance , of enormous value .
even stranger would be the scenario if three teams ended up level on points .
the goal-difference rule applies there as well , but there has considerable confusion about precisely how it , and other rules , would be applied in this unlikely but possible scenario .
if else fails , the decision will be made by flipping a coin .
that is extremely , extremely unlikely , but anything could happen in a group of death with more than its fair share of oddities .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of the chainsaw is increasingly part of daily life in the rainforest brazil 's president luiz inacio lula da silva reportedly wants to reduce the amount of amazon rain forest being cleared by 80 percent by 2020 .

following the failure of global climate talks in copenhagen last december , lula reportedly urged un secretary-general ban ki moon during a private meeting to press for a global agreement .
lula said the un is the right forum for discussions about climate change .
controversial dam project lula 's policy on protecting the environment and the rain forest became apparent in early february when brazil 's environment agency ibama approved the construction of a controversial hydro-electric dam belo monte in the middle of the amazon rain forest .
when it is completed , belo monte will be the third largest hydro-electric dam in the world , after the three gorges in china and itaipu , which is jointly run by brazil and paraguay .
it is expected to provide electricity to 23 million brazilian homes .
but residents as well as environmental activists have protested the building of the mega dam in the brazilian state of para .
the justice ministry in para has even tried to prevent the project but lula 's government has stood firm and pushed the project , estimated to cost billions .
construction is slated to begin later in 2010 - a year in which brazil holds general elections .
some 20,000 indigenous people are to be resettled and some 516 square kilometers -lrb- 199 square miles -rrb- of rain forest are to be flooded for the dam 's construction .
business interests damaging rain forest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainforest is being cleared away to make room for lucrative cattle ranching despite pledges by lula 's government to protect the rain forest and the global climate , tree-cutting and the clearing of forests to make way for pastures and cultivation of fields is continuing .
it 's no surprise considering that one of brazil 's leading exports includes beef used in burgers in fast food chains around the world .
that has made cattle ranching more profitable for farmers and encouraged them to deforest .
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations -lrb- fao -rrb- said in march that these business interests have led brazil to sacrifice an average of 26,000 square kilometers -lrb- 10,040 square miles -rrb- of forest each year in the past decade .
the rapid pace of deforestation has done irreparable damage to the so-called " air conditioner " of the world , as environmental activists call the rainforest .
the amazon acts as a " carbon sink , " absorbing carbon dioxide but once the trees are cut down , this absorption stops .
often the wood is burned , releasing carbon , and the loss of forest cover can also lead to carbon release from the soil .
the forest also releases enough water to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration to influence world climate patterns .
a ray of hope the gtz , a german state-owned organization working for sustainable development worldwide , says that the environment laws passed in brazil so far ca n't stop the destruction of the country 's tropical forests .
it estimates that around 680,000 square kilometers -lrb- 262,550 square miles -rrb- of rain forest in the amazon or 17 percent of its original area has been destroyed so far .
along the atlantic coast , just seven percent of rain forest has been preserved .

it was founded by lula 's predecessor fernando henrique cardoso who , in 1998 , vowed to designate 12 percent of the rain forest as an officially protected zone by 2012 .
that has now been postponed to 2016 and there are plans to declare the entire 600,000 square kilometers -lrb- 231,660 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest as a protected zone by then .
some progress has already been made .
so far around 390,000 square kilometers -lrb- 150,580 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest has been marked as a federally-protected zone .
but the gtz says that only half of that - just four percent of the amazon rain forest - is strictly protected . that 's too less , according to the group .
critics trace the lowest rate of deforestation in 2009 to the global financial crisis .
" the demand for beef , soya and wood has dramatically fallen , " paulo adario of greenpeace said .

when it is completed , belo monte will be the third largest hydro-electric dam in the world , after the three gorges in china and itaipu , which is jointly run by brazil and paraguay .
it is expected to provide electricity to 23 million brazilian homes .
but residents as well as environmental activists have protested the building of the mega dam in the brazilian state of para .
the justice ministry in para has even tried to prevent the project but lula 's government has stood firm and pushed the project , estimated to cost billions .
construction is slated to begin later in 2010 - a year in which brazil holds general elections .
some 20,000 indigenous people are to be resettled and some 516 square kilometers -lrb- 199 square miles -rrb- of rain forest are to be flooded for the dam 's construction .
business interests damaging rain forest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainforest is being cleared away to make room for lucrative cattle ranching despite pledges by lula 's government to protect the rain forest and the global climate , tree-cutting and the clearing of forests to make way for pastures and cultivation of fields is continuing .
it 's no surprise considering that one of brazil 's leading exports includes beef used in burgers in fast food chains around the world .
that has made cattle ranching more profitable for farmers and encouraged them to deforest .
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations -lrb- fao -rrb- said in march that these business interests have led brazil to sacrifice an average of 26,000 square kilometers -lrb- 10,040 square miles -rrb- of forest each year in the past decade .
the rapid pace of deforestation has done irreparable damage to the so-called " air conditioner " of the world , as environmental activists call the rainforest .
the amazon acts as a " carbon sink , " absorbing carbon dioxide but once the trees are cut down , this absorption stops .
often the wood is burned , releasing carbon , and the loss of forest cover can also lead to carbon release from the soil .
the forest also releases enough water to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration to influence world climate patterns .
a ray of hope the gtz , a german state-owned organization working for sustainable development worldwide , says that the environment laws passed in brazil so far ca n't stop the destruction of the country 's tropical forests .
it estimates that around 680,000 square kilometers -lrb- 262,550 square miles -rrb- of rain forest in the amazon or 17 percent of its original area has been destroyed so far .
along the atlantic coast , just seven percent of rain forest has been preserved .
bildunterschrift : comparative satellite images highlight the extent of the damage in the brazilian state of rondonia the project " amazon region protected area " -lrb- arpa -rrb- , which is supported by germany , provides a ray of hope .
it was founded by lula 's predecessor fernando henrique cardoso who , in 1998 , vowed to designate 12 percent of the rain forest as an officially protected zone by 2012 .
that has now been postponed to 2016 and there are plans to declare the entire 600,000 square kilometers -lrb- 231,660 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest as a protected zone by then .
some progress has already been made .
so far around 390,000 square kilometers -lrb- 150,580 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest has been marked as a federally-protected zone .
but the gtz says that only half of that - just four percent of the amazon rain forest - is strictly protected . that 's too less , according to the group .
critics trace the lowest rate of deforestation in 2009 to the global financial crisis .
" the demand for beef , soya and wood has dramatically fallen , " paulo adario of greenpeace said .
but he added that slowing deforestation has little to do with efforts to protect the climate .
that means in the worst-case scenario , the brazilian rainforest faces another wave of erosion as soon as world markets begin clamoring for brazil 's exports again .

but the lack of mass rallies should n't be seen as a lack of public anger . when the oil tanker erika sank and broke apart off the french coast in december 1999 , the public was outraged .
an estimated crowd of 20,000 demonstrated at a rally in nantes against french oil giant total whose leased vessel had spilled approximately three million gallons of oil .
the disaster killed as many as 75,000 birds and spoiled around 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- of the coast .
three years later when the oil tanker prestige sank off the galician coast causing spain 's biggest environmental catastrophe in history , the spaniards took the the streets as well .
at least 12,000 demonstrators gathered at one rally in barcelona alone to voice their anger over the crisis management of the spanish government .
the prestige 's spill of around 20 million gallons of oil contaminated large parts of the french and spanish coasts .
the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico dwarfs both the erika and prestige disasters .
according to recent revised estimates the deepwater horizon rig has already leaked between 42 and 100 million gallons into the water with no end in sight .
that means the bp leak is causing a spill the size of the exxon valez disaster every five to 13 days .
it is by far the worst environmental disaster in us history .
few protestors at bp headquarters and yet after weeks of uninterrupted spilling , a recent rally at bp 's washington headquarters according to media reports attracted only a few dozen protesters .
a protest event in new orleans , which is directly affected by the spill , also drew only some 200 people according to media reports . " that 's not the us style , " michael e. kraft , professor of public and environmental affairs at the university of wisconsin-green bay , told deutsche welle .
" people do n't protest like that over almost anything .
but i would n't take that to mean that there is a lack of public concern . "
his colleague christoph goerg , an expert for global environmental governance at the leipzig-based helmholtz centre for environmental research , agrees : " i do n't think that the environmental consciousness in the us is generally less-developed than in europe . "
goerg believes that the absence of mass gatherings is a characteristic of the political culture in the us and the ability and the willingness of the people to articulate themselves publicly .
" what is definitely different especially compared to france , but also spain , is that in those countries there are very strong lobby groups of fishermen , but also farmers who are able not only to articulate themselves , but also to organize the people most affected by the spill and give them a public platform . " opinion polls show frustration of crisis management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of spaniards demonstrated after the prestige disaster while americans may not flock to the streets , numerous opinion surveys show that the us public is in fact deeply worried about the disaster .
seventy percent of americans , according to one poll , disapprove of bp 's handling of the crisis .
president barack obama 's crisis management has also been heavily criticized .
there are also indications of a significant shift in public opinion over offshore drilling .
in florida , one of the worst affected states , according to a new poll 51 percent of floridians now oppose new offshore drilling .
before the disaster 66 percent were in favor of drilling and only 27 against it .
but is there no way to gauge the public sentiment beyond mere surveys ?
sure , say the experts .
just log on to the internet or turn on the television .
since the explosion on the oil rig , news crews are present covering the spill around the clock .
comedians like bill maher and jon stewart have targeted bp and the obama administration repeatedly .
and in the gulf states many locals have displayed placards and posters showing their frustration over bp , but also over the government 's response .
anti-bp art on the internet on the internet new groups and websites devoted to the disaster are springing up every day .
one of the biggest ones , the boycott bp group on facebook , attracts thousands of new supporters daily and currently has more than 600,000 fans .
and at the popular blog huffington post readers can vent their anger with anti-bp art .
" the public sphere is not the street alone anymore , but also the internet with its various media outlets , " explains goerg .
" a lot of public discourse is carried out over the internet in a new kind of way that also creates new forms of publicity . "
bildunterschrift : oil companies like bp face tougher regulations and higher liability this , argues goerg , has both positive and negative aspects .
" when one attends a rally with others this is something different than when one is active on twitter or voices an opinion somewhere else on the internet , " he says .
" that is more difficult during a public rally , but on the other hand , the connection with others is stronger and one feels more like being part of a group . " the most important benchmark for the effectiveness of public sentiment over the oil spill though , argues kraft , may not be how many people attend a rally , but whether the disaster affects change .
" i think you will see some real public policy changes .
almost certainly there will be very substantial increases in environmental and safety restrictions . "
and , add the experts , one of the most important things to do is to make sure that companies like bp have a very strong financial interest in ensuring that something like this never happens again .
this process has already begun , notes kraft : " the price of bp stock has plummeted since the disaster by something like 40 percent or $ 73 billion -lrb- 60 billion euros -rrb- . so the reaction here may be a little more subtle than it is in europe . "

but the lack of mass rallies should n't be seen as a lack of public anger . when the oil tanker erika sank and broke apart off the french coast in december 1999 , the public was outraged .
an estimated crowd of 20,000 demonstrated at a rally in nantes against french oil giant total whose leased vessel had spilled approximately three million gallons of oil .
the disaster killed as many as 75,000 birds and spoiled around 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- of the coast .
three years later when the oil tanker prestige sank off the galician coast causing spain 's biggest environmental catastrophe in history , the spaniards took the the streets as well .
at least 12,000 demonstrators gathered at one rally in barcelona alone to voice their anger over the crisis management of the spanish government .
the prestige 's spill of around 20 million gallons of oil contaminated large parts of the french and spanish coasts .
the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico dwarfs both the erika and prestige disasters .
according to recent revised estimates the deepwater horizon rig has already leaked between 42 and 100 million gallons into the water with no end in sight .
that means the bp leak is causing a spill the size of the exxon valez disaster every five to 13 days .
it is by far the worst environmental disaster in us history .
few protestors at bp headquarters and yet after weeks of uninterrupted spilling , a recent rally at bp 's washington headquarters according to media reports attracted only a few dozen protesters .
a protest event in new orleans , which is directly affected by the spill , also drew only some 200 people according to media reports . " that 's not the us style , " michael e. kraft , professor of public and environmental affairs at the university of wisconsin-green bay , told deutsche welle .
" people do n't protest like that over almost anything .
but i would n't take that to mean that there is a lack of public concern . "
his colleague christoph goerg , an expert for global environmental governance at the leipzig-based helmholtz centre for environmental research , agrees : " i do n't think that the environmental consciousness in the us is generally less-developed than in europe . "
goerg believes that the absence of mass gatherings is a characteristic of the political culture in the us and the ability and the willingness of the people to articulate themselves publicly .
" what is definitely different especially compared to france , but also spain , is that in those countries there are very strong lobby groups of fishermen , but also farmers who are able not only to articulate themselves , but also to organize the people most affected by the spill and give them a public platform . " opinion polls show frustration of crisis management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of spaniards demonstrated after the prestige disaster while americans may not flock to the streets , numerous opinion surveys show that the us public is in fact deeply worried about the disaster .
seventy percent of americans , according to one poll , disapprove of bp 's handling of the crisis .
president barack obama 's crisis management has also been heavily criticized .
there are also indications of a significant shift in public opinion over offshore drilling .
in florida , one of the worst affected states , according to a new poll 51 percent of floridians now oppose new offshore drilling .
before the disaster 66 percent were in favor of drilling and only 27 against it .
but is there no way to gauge the public sentiment beyond mere surveys ?
sure , say the experts .
just log on to the internet or turn on the television .
since the explosion on the oil rig , news crews are present covering the spill around the clock .
comedians like bill maher and jon stewart have targeted bp and the obama administration repeatedly .
and in the gulf states many locals have displayed placards and posters showing their frustration over bp , but also over the government 's response .
anti-bp art on the internet on the internet new groups and websites devoted to the disaster are springing up every day .
one of the biggest ones , the boycott bp group on facebook , attracts thousands of new supporters daily and currently has more than 600,000 fans .
and at the popular blog huffington post readers can vent their anger with anti-bp art .

the information implicates as many as 4,450 people with accounts with ubs . swiss lawmakers have backed a deal with the us that would see banking giant ubs forced to hand over data on 4,450 us clients suspected of tax evasion .
the swiss and us governments , along with switzerland 's largest bank ubs , had agreed the deal in 2009 , but it needed parliamentary approval after the swiss supreme court called its legality into question .
switzerland has long faced criticism from the international community over its secretive banking laws that protect the identities of account holders with banks such as ubs .
last week it seemed the deal may have been dead in the water after parties from across the political spectrum in switzerland voted against the government-brokered agreement .
approval of the deal - by 81 votes to 61 , with 53 lawmakers abstaining - was reached after the lower house was asked to hold a second vote .
technical details remain to be ironed out and the proposal may still be put to the swiss public in a referendum before it finally becomes law .
approval of the deal could go a long way to settling lawsuits by us authorities and could save switzerland and several of its banks considerable sums of money in legal fees .

speaking during a debate in the european parliament in strasbourg , rehn said that the decision to cut greece 's rating was both " surprising " and " unfortunate " at a time when eu and imf auditors were taking a hard look at the country 's attempts to slash its debt .
the eu commissioner said that the downgrade , which he had discussed with financial services commissioner michel barnier and european commission president jose manuel barroso , " again raises issues related to the role of credit rating agencies in the financial system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn says the credit rating industry needs a shake-up rehn said that the eu commission , which is seeking to regulate ratings agencies under new reforms due to be implemented in 2011 , will probe " the level of competition in the sector " and fears that a lack of transparency could represent a " conflict of interest . "
not everyone surprised but many financial experts say the downgrade by moody 's was not totally unexpected given that rival ratings agency standard and poor 's downgraded greece 's sovereign debt to junk status in april , while fitch , the other major ratings agency , warned weeks later that it , too , may follow .
" nothing has really changed since then , " said alcidi cinzia , a research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
" the agency has just put down on paper what the market has been thinking for some time , " she told deutsche welle .
questionable creditworthiness in a statement issued monday , moody 's justified its decision to lower greece 's creditworthiness rating by four notches from a3 to ba1 by pointing to considerable market uncertainty surrounding the country 's plans to reduce its huge debt and balance its finances – even with the help of the eu-imf bailout package .
moody 's describes the ba1 rating as below investment grade - or " junk " status in market parlance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister george papandreou has been facing some tough questions the downgrade means some investors will no longer be allowed to buy greek debt under the terms of their investment mandate and could lead to still higher borrowing costs for athens if it goes to the markets for cash .
observers agree that the downgrade is yet another blow to the debt-ridden country , which is under intense international scrutiny .
last month , it narrowly avoided default after the european union and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- agreed to intervene with a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- bailout .
the bailout from the eu and the imf means that greece is highly unlikely to default in the short term , if at all .
and it gives the country a few years to get its fiscal act together .
cut spending , promote growth but the bailout is a loan - not a gift - meaning that it adds to greece 's debt .
to climb out of trouble , the country will need to cut spending and , at the same time , grow its economy .
while experts agree this will be a difficult trick to pull off , the greek government has been trying hard to promote confidence in its plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks protest the government 's sweeping austerity program so , understandably , officials in athens were n't happy with moody 's call , especially its timing .
shortly after the ratings agency released its statement , the greek ministry of finance fired off it own .
" moody 's downgrade of greek government bonds today does not reflect in any way greece 's progress over the past months , " the ministry wrote .
" nor does it reflect the potential created by the country 's effort of fiscal consolidation and increased competitiveness . "
" greece is moving ahead with all the reforms stipulated in the memorandum of understanding , -lrb- and -rrb- for many of these reforms , it is already ahead of schedule . "

speaking during a debate in the european parliament in strasbourg , rehn said that the decision to cut greece 's rating was both " surprising " and " unfortunate " at a time when eu and imf auditors were taking a hard look at the country 's attempts to slash its debt .
the eu commissioner said that the downgrade , which he had discussed with financial services commissioner michel barnier and european commission president jose manuel barroso , " again raises issues related to the role of credit rating agencies in the financial system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn says the credit rating industry needs a shake-up rehn said that the eu commission , which is seeking to regulate ratings agencies under new reforms due to be implemented in 2011 , will probe " the level of competition in the sector " and fears that a lack of transparency could represent a " conflict of interest . "
not everyone surprised but many financial experts say the downgrade by moody 's was not totally unexpected given that rival ratings agency standard and poor 's downgraded greece 's sovereign debt to junk status in april , while fitch , the other major ratings agency , warned weeks later that it , too , may follow .
" nothing has really changed since then , " said alcidi cinzia , a research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
" the agency has just put down on paper what the market has been thinking for some time , " she told deutsche welle .
questionable creditworthiness in a statement issued monday , moody 's justified its decision to lower greece 's creditworthiness rating by four notches from a3 to ba1 by pointing to considerable market uncertainty surrounding the country 's plans to reduce its huge debt and balance its finances – even with the help of the eu-imf bailout package .
moody 's describes the ba1 rating as below investment grade - or " junk " status in market parlance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister george papandreou has been facing some tough questions the downgrade means some investors will no longer be allowed to buy greek debt under the terms of their investment mandate and could lead to still higher borrowing costs for athens if it goes to the markets for cash .
observers agree that the downgrade is yet another blow to the debt-ridden country , which is under intense international scrutiny .
last month , it narrowly avoided default after the european union and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- agreed to intervene with a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- bailout .
the bailout from the eu and the imf means that greece is highly unlikely to default in the short term , if at all .
and it gives the country a few years to get its fiscal act together .
cut spending , promote growth but the bailout is a loan - not a gift - meaning that it adds to greece 's debt .
to climb out of trouble , the country will need to cut spending and , at the same time , grow its economy .
while experts agree this will be a difficult trick to pull off , the greek government has been trying hard to promote confidence in its plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks protest the government 's sweeping austerity program so , understandably , officials in athens were n't happy with moody 's call , especially its timing .
shortly after the ratings agency released its statement , the greek ministry of finance fired off it own .
" moody 's downgrade of greek government bonds today does not reflect in any way greece 's progress over the past months , " the ministry wrote .
" nor does it reflect the potential created by the country 's effort of fiscal consolidation and increased competitiveness . "
" greece is moving ahead with all the reforms stipulated in the memorandum of understanding , -lrb- and -rrb- for many of these reforms , it is already ahead of schedule . "

although recycling can help protect the environment and save resources , a closer look at the electronic scrap business reveals an extremely harmful industry .
it represents a massive health hazard for those whose job it is to sort out the old computers , cd players and printers from the west . " take a look , no problem . "
harish puts his bare hands into a big plastic container that is filled with a greenish liquid , which is bubbling at the surface .
it turns out to be nitric acid .
it burns the eyes and the nose if you hold your head too close . harish , who works on the outskirts of delhi on an industrial estate that has not been approved by the state , does know that his job could damage his health , especially his respiratory tracts .
but what else can he do , he asks .
he has no qualifications . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large amount of the world 's electronic waste goes to india for recycling dangerous process ravi aggarwal works with the ngo toxics link .
he explains how dangerous the chemical etching process is – anything that can fetch money is put in an acid bath : " it is extremely corrosive , which is the whole idea .
so when you put an epoxy board in it , then it melts away the board and leaves the copper to be stripped and to be recycled .
it can cause very strong burns , and when you throw it out , it will corrode everything around it .
but there are also fumes which come out . " the recyclers then sell on the copper from the electronic scrap that has come from all over the world – often by illegal means , says aggarwal : " all the e-waste that comes in comes in not as e-waste but under other categories or permitted ways , such as ' mixed metal scrap ' .
so we have seen containers and tracked bills of entry , which are customs documents , which contain e-waste .
our estimate is from 50,000 to 60,000 tons of electronic waste per year at least that has come in . " bildunterschrift : a worker sorts electronic equipment for recycling government ambivalent india 's coast is long and there are hardly any controls .
however , recently a scandal erupted when radioactive scrap was found on a garbage heap in the middle of delhi .
the government has promised to take action and laws are currently under debate but ravi aggarwal is skeptical . " it is very easy to stop .
you just have to put scanners at the ports and you can stop it .
but i think there is an ambivalence in government policy , because the government is saying : ok , we do n't want it , but it is good for the economy .
so , all the policy statements have been ambivalent about it .
i think this ambivalence means that they are not really serious about stopping it . " recently , government officials have started appearing at the industrial estate on the outskirts of delhi , a place where there are literally towers of garbage .
they have banned the use of acid baths and the burning of poisonous scrap . however , a man who runs a small recycling business doubts whether people will heed the government 's warnings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : oil spill in the gulf of mexico the oil disaster the world prefers to ignore bp oil spill must have global consequences , says former un expert obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist americans vent anger over oil spill differently from europeans environment -pipe- 15.06.2010 full oil spill compensation looks increasingly unlikely großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama is concluding a two day tour of affected areas in combating the gulf of mexcio oil spill , bp has resorted to controversial methods of distancing itself from negative publicity .
critics fear full compensation for environmental and economic damage is unlikely . more than six weeks after the now infamous sinking of the deepwater horizon oil rig in the gulf of mexico , efforts to staunch crude oil flowing from an underwater well have only partially succeeded .
meanwhile , the environmental and financial tolls of the catastrophe have yet to be fully assessed .
tourism and fishing industries along the gulf of mexico have suffered devastating effects as oil washes ashore and vast areas of water are polluted , killing wildlife .
bp has stopped referring to the catastrophe using the name of the " deepwater horizon " rig in favor of using the short-form name of the well it dug , " mc252 . "
it has also limited press access to affected areas , limited the release of information and bought up spill-related online search terms at major search engines .
obama foresees policy changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said the spill will shape future environment and energy policies w hile bp has already agreed to some financial compensation , skeptics doubt the full costs of the spill will ever be recovered .
currently bp is collecting about 15,000 barrels of oil a day – about half the amount believed to be leaking .
the company 's latest plan follows pressure from the obama administration and calls for more than 50,000 barrels a day to be collected by the end of june .
the well is expected to continue leaking until bp completes the first of two relief wells in august .
obama said in a recent interview the spill would alter us policy during coming years .
he has also lamented the threat posed to the gulf of mexico coastline with its wildlife-filled wetlands , beaches and waters teeming with shrimps , crabs and fish .
" in the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9/11 , i think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come , " he told the washington-based news organization politico .
fair compensation doubted a number of ngos fear that local populations and ecosystems will ultimately shoulder the catastrophe 's most significant burdens while bp minimizes losses for itself and its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers cleaning up spilled oil may later suffer health problems greenpeace spokeswoman cindy baxter said she expects a scenario similar to the aftermath of the 1989 exxon valdez spill , during which 40,000 tons of crude oil leaked into alaska 's prince william sound .
that resulted in a 19-year legal process over a five-billion-dollar compensation deal .
" exxon has taken it through the courts , and through the courts , and through the courts .
the original five billion dollars ?
that estimated amount of compensation has now been reduced to $ 500 million .
people who wanted compensation died looking for it .
that includes workers who were working on the spill and have had huge amounts of health problems from working with the dispersants that they used , " she told deutsche welle .
economic interests at risk in addition to the damage caused by the current disaster , experts say prospecting for fossil fuels will likely become riskier in the future as energy demand rises and easily accessible resources dwindle .
advocates for renewable energy sources have been quick to point this out .
felix matthes , an expert on renewable energy at the berlin institute for applied ecology , says aggressive development of renewable energy infrastructure is a necessary investment which can be unified with economic interests .
" this catastrophe in the gulf of mexico has made it clear that the current use of energy – especially as accessing raw materials becomes ever more complicated , and this access means disturbing ever more delicate ecosystems – can come at a high cost , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp may shirk fully compensating affected locals like fishermen but the global economy is still based on oil , and the oil industry enjoys political protections .
the united states ' 1990 oil pollution act , signed into law by president george bush sr. , limits liability in the case of a spill to $ 75 million .
similarly , louisiana 's senator mary landrieu has taken a stance protecting the oil industry as a whole .
david cadman of the organization local governments for sustainability said he believes bp has failed to put enough emphasis on cleanup efforts .
" the previous bush administration basically limited the liability of the oil companies in case of an accident , and i think that 's going to come home to roost .
all of a sudden we 're going to see the bills , and there 's going to be a great fight as to who should pay those bills .
and i suspect bp is going to say : ' this is the agreement we had .
we pay up to this and no more . " '

critics fear full compensation for environmental and economic damage is unlikely . more than six weeks after the now infamous sinking of the deepwater horizon oil rig in the gulf of mexico , efforts to staunch crude oil flowing from an underwater well have only partially succeeded .
meanwhile , the environmental and financial tolls of the catastrophe have yet to be fully assessed .
tourism and fishing industries along the gulf of mexico have suffered devastating effects as oil washes ashore and vast areas of water are polluted , killing wildlife .
bp has stopped referring to the catastrophe using the name of the " deepwater horizon " rig in favor of using the short-form name of the well it dug , " mc252 . "
it has also limited press access to affected areas , limited the release of information and bought up spill-related online search terms at major search engines .
obama foresees policy changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said the spill will shape future environment and energy policies w hile bp has already agreed to some financial compensation , skeptics doubt the full costs of the spill will ever be recovered .
currently bp is collecting about 15,000 barrels of oil a day – about half the amount believed to be leaking .
the company 's latest plan follows pressure from the obama administration and calls for more than 50,000 barrels a day to be collected by the end of june .
the well is expected to continue leaking until bp completes the first of two relief wells in august .
obama said in a recent interview the spill would alter us policy during coming years .
he has also lamented the threat posed to the gulf of mexico coastline with its wildlife-filled wetlands , beaches and waters teeming with shrimps , crabs and fish .
" in the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9/11 , i think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come , " he told the washington-based news organization politico .
fair compensation doubted a number of ngos fear that local populations and ecosystems will ultimately shoulder the catastrophe 's most significant burdens while bp minimizes losses for itself and its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers cleaning up spilled oil may later suffer health problems greenpeace spokeswoman cindy baxter said she expects a scenario similar to the aftermath of the 1989 exxon valdez spill , during which 40,000 tons of crude oil leaked into alaska 's prince william sound .
that resulted in a 19-year legal process over a five-billion-dollar compensation deal .
" exxon has taken it through the courts , and through the courts , and through the courts .
the original five billion dollars ?
that estimated amount of compensation has now been reduced to $ 500 million .
people who wanted compensation died looking for it .
that includes workers who were working on the spill and have had huge amounts of health problems from working with the dispersants that they used , " she told deutsche welle .
economic interests at risk in addition to the damage caused by the current disaster , experts say prospecting for fossil fuels will likely become riskier in the future as energy demand rises and easily accessible resources dwindle .
advocates for renewable energy sources have been quick to point this out .
felix matthes , an expert on renewable energy at the berlin institute for applied ecology , says aggressive development of renewable energy infrastructure is a necessary investment which can be unified with economic interests .
" this catastrophe in the gulf of mexico has made it clear that the current use of energy – especially as accessing raw materials becomes ever more complicated , and this access means disturbing ever more delicate ecosystems – can come at a high cost , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp may shirk fully compensating affected locals like fishermen but the global economy is still based on oil , and the oil industry enjoys political protections .
the united states ' 1990 oil pollution act , signed into law by president george bush sr. , limits liability in the case of a spill to $ 75 million .
similarly , louisiana 's senator mary landrieu has taken a stance protecting the oil industry as a whole .
david cadman of the organization local governments for sustainability said he believes bp has failed to put enough emphasis on cleanup efforts .
" the previous bush administration basically limited the liability of the oil companies in case of an accident , and i think that 's going to come home to roost .
all of a sudden we 're going to see the bills , and there 's going to be a great fight as to who should pay those bills .
and i suspect bp is going to say : ' this is the agreement we had .
we pay up to this and no more . " '

brazilian midfielder elano played a through-ball to defender maicon , who fired a nearly sideways shot from less than a meter from the end line .

this time it was elano who took the easy shot following a precision cross from robinho . if history is any guide , it was only a matter of time before one of brazil 's attacks made it through : the brazilians have scored at least one goal in every group stage match of the world cup since 1978 , when they drew 0-0 against spain . north korea pulled one back near the end of the game as forward jong tae se laid down a header in front of defender ji yun nam , who booted the ball over brazilian keeper julio cesar to score in the 89th minute . drogba back in action despite playing a hard-fought match on both sides , neither team in the other group g match between the ivory coast and portugal had a particularly high number of scoring opportunities , and the ones that did come along never resulted in a goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drogba 's broken arm did n't keep him out of the world cup for long one highlight of the game for the ivory coast was the return of their star captain , didier drogba .

'
group mates ivory coast and portugal finished scoreless , while a late new zealand goal saved a point against slovakia . in the world cup debut of the so-called ' group of death ' - formally known as group g - brazil emerged on top after its 2-1 win over north korea . perennial world cup favorites brazil dominated possession in the first half but a resolute north korean defense kept coach carlos dunga 's squad from finding the back of the net . brazil kept up the pressure in the second half , continuing to probe north korea 's defense but being turned away every time . that changed in the 55th minute .
brazilian midfielder elano played a through-ball to defender maicon , who fired a nearly sideways shot from less than a meter from the end line .
the ball slipped between north korean keeper ri myong guk and the near post before curving over the line and into the goal . bildunterschrift : north korea was on defense for most of the game the brazilians added a second goal in the 72nd minute .
this time it was elano who took the easy shot following a precision cross from robinho . if history is any guide , it was only a matter of time before one of brazil 's attacks made it through : the brazilians have scored at least one goal in every group stage match of the world cup since 1978 , when they drew 0-0 against spain . north korea pulled one back near the end of the game as forward jong tae se laid down a header in front of defender ji yun nam , who booted the ball over brazilian keeper julio cesar to score in the 89th minute . drogba back in action despite playing a hard-fought match on both sides , neither team in the other group g match between the ivory coast and portugal had a particularly high number of scoring opportunities , and the ones that did come along never resulted in a goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drogba 's broken arm did n't keep him out of the world cup for long one highlight of the game for the ivory coast was the return of their star captain , didier drogba .
the forward broke his arm in a warm-up match against japan 11 days ago , and his status for the group g opener against portugal was questionable . although drogba did n't start , he was subbed in the 66th minute for salomon kalou , a teammate of drogba 's at fc chelsea . the ivory coast 's next match is a big one in the group as they face brazil .
portugal faces north korea on monday . better late than never it took new zealand literally the entire game , but their lone goal against slovakia could n't have come at a better time .
slovakia looked to be on their way to a 1-0 win as the referee indicated three minutes of injury time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reid -lrb- left -rrb- celebrates his last-second goal for new zealand but new zealand put together a hectic offensive sequence after two and a half minutes of injury time and managed to tie the game , salvaging a point in group f with the 1-1 draw . with the final whistle seconds away , new zealand forward shane smeltz delivered a cross to defender winston reid , who connected for a header . slovakia 's goal was nearly identical but came in the 50th minute .
after slowly building up an attack , slovakian forward stanislav sestak launched a curling cross that was right on target for robert vittek to score on a header . the group 's other teams , italy and paraguay , also played to a 1-1 tie on monday night , meaning group f is all square with one point per team . author : matt zuvela editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report concludes that british troops were " unjustified " in firing on protestors on that day in 1972 . british prime minister david cameron has apologized on behalf of the british government for the ' bloody sunday ' massacre in northern ireland in 1972 that left 14 civilian protesters dead at the hands of british troops .
cameron presented the results of a massive 12-year inquiry into the incident to parliament on tuesday , saying that the events of bloody sunday were in no way justified .
" what happened should never , ever , have happened , " cameron said .
" some members of our armed forces acted wrongly . "
initial reports made in 1972 showed that british troops had acted appropriately when they fired on catholic civilians in londonderry .
at the time , the troops indicated that they had fired on civilians who were armed .
however , cameron said that this was not the case and added that some troops had deliberately made false statements about the shootings to make it appear that they had been justified in firing .
the report concludes that the british troops fired first and were unprovoked .
" the government is ultimately responsible for the conduct of the armed forces .
and for that , on behalf of the government , indeed on behalf of our country , i am deeply sorry , " cameron said .

the report concludes that british troops were " unjustified " in firing on protestors on that day in 1972 . british prime minister david cameron has apologized on behalf of the british government for the ' bloody sunday ' massacre in northern ireland in 1972 that left 14 civilian protesters dead at the hands of british troops .
cameron presented the results of a massive 12-year inquiry into the incident to parliament on tuesday , saying that the events of bloody sunday were in no way justified .
" what happened should never , ever , have happened , " cameron said .
" some members of our armed forces acted wrongly . "
initial reports made in 1972 showed that british troops had acted appropriately when they fired on catholic civilians in londonderry .
at the time , the troops indicated that they had fired on civilians who were armed .
however , cameron said that this was not the case and added that some troops had deliberately made false statements about the shootings to make it appear that they had been justified in firing .
the report concludes that the british troops fired first and were unprovoked .
" the government is ultimately responsible for the conduct of the armed forces .
and for that , on behalf of the government , indeed on behalf of our country , i am deeply sorry , " cameron said .

the country 's development minister wants to merge them under a single name . development minister dirk niebel announced tuesday that he wants to consolidate three of germany 's international development agencies into one entity , to be called the german association for international cooperation .
niebel said the move would increase efficiency and reduce red tape .
the new institution would include german technical aid organization gtz , the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- , and the international capacity-building agency inwent .
it would officially come into existence on january 1 , 2011 - if the federal cabinet approves the change in a vote scheduled for july 7 .
the three agencies currently employ a total of 17,000 people worldwide .
their replacement would have its headquarters in bonn and a second office in eschborn , near frankfurt .
inwent would retain its 14 regional offices in germany and others maintained with partners throughout the world .
savings will remain in the development budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel 's plans for reform of germany 's development infrastructure are controversial niebel , a member of germany 's pro-business free democratic party , told german television that the move was completely separate from the federal government 's recently announced cost-cutting measures .
" it 's natural , of course , that with increasingly strained public finance , things must be made more efficient , " niebel said .
niebel said he had talked to the finance minister about allowing the savings from the consolidation to remain within the ministry budget - so that although the ministry would not see any funding increases until 2014 , it would n't see any budget cuts , either .
the plan has been criticized by the opposition social democrats ' spokesperson for development policy , sascha raabe .
raabe told the protestant news service -lrb- epd -rrb- that niebel lacked the courage for the required major reforms , and was instead making cosmetic changes .
" that is not going to help our partners in the world , " raabe said .

the south should last longer while nobody will admit to arriving at the world cup just to make up the numbers , the realists among the 32 nations competing will know that it 's highly unlikely that they 'll get out of the group stages . no-one can say what will happen at a world cup .
previous form means little in the heat of battle at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
good teams can have bad days and bad teams can have good ones .
but there are certain teams who arrive with barely a shred of hope of getting out of the group stage .
they may make things difficult for their group opponents and maybe pull off a shock on their way out of the competition , but these are the teams who arrive with no expectations and who are just happy to be there .
there are a number of teams who may struggle in the group stages but here , deutsche welle takes a look at three teams who may already have their return tickets booked for june 26th when the knock-out stage begins .
north korea the team from the one of the world 's most secretive and repressive states is apparently resorting to type in south africa by keeping its preparations and players under cover .
journalists are given short shrift , while training sessions - which every other team has opened to the public - are held behind closed doors .
perhaps north korea are just afraid at showing their group c rivals just how bad they are .
saying that , they are at the world cup for the first time since they famously reached the quarter-finals of the 1966 finals so they ca n't be that bad – can they ?
bildunterschrift : let 's hope that the north korean team are as well-drilled and co-ordinated as their supporters qualifying from the asia conference after beating the likes of saudi arabia , jordan and united arab emirates , and holding their own with their more experienced southern neighbors , north korea – known as the chollima , a mythical horse too swift to be mounted – start with a clean slate , just like everyone else at the 2010 world cup .
but after failing to make the finals at any point in the last 44 years and finding themselves in the " group of death " with brazil , portugal and the ivory coast , it does n't matter how good or bad they are , the smart money is on north korea heading home after three games .
the team , ranked 105th in the world , is made up predominantly of players who feature in north korean teams with only a handful playing outside of the ironhanded communist state .
jong tae-se , known as asia 's wayne rooney , and an yong-hak play in japan 's j-league while striker hong yong-jo plays for russia 's fc rostov .
such is the nature of the country 's regime , very little is known about the rest of the team .
new zealand coming from one of the most laid-back countries on earth , the all whites arrive in south africa under no illusions .
faced with a group featuring world champions italy , paraguay and slovakia , the new zealand team accepts that their world cup is likely to end at the group stage .
this will not stop them from giving their all and enjoying the experience to the fullest .
bildunterschrift : the all whites - here in all black - may not be world beaters but they might make it harder for others however , instead of arriving expecting to get thrashed , the all whites are quietly confident that they can at least give their group f opponents a few headaches after a 1-0 friendly victory over serbia and feisty defeats to chile , to whom they lost 2-0 , and a close 2-1 loss to oceania rivals australia .
while they might not be heading for knock-out stage qualification themselves , their involvement in the tournament may at least dictate who out of their group opponents ' progress .
the minnows from the cinematic middle earth have only featured in one other word cup , in spain in 1982 , when they lost all three matches .
much like what is expected from this tournament , the all whites gave a good account of themselves in a difficult group featuring brazil , the soviet union and scotland .
honduras if facing one of the world cup favorites , a plucky european battler , and one of the best teams in south america -lrb- on current form -rrb- is n't bad enough , honduras arrive in south africa without a win to their name since january 's 2-1 victory over the united states .
they recently struggled in a goalless draw with azerbaijan , labored to a 2-2 draw against belarus and also got beaten 3-0 by non-qualifier romania in their final friendly before heading to the world cup .
getting the type of results to beat spain , switzerland and chile to qualify from group h may be a tall order for honduras on current form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavon and co. are already being written off back home there is quality in the side , which features tottenham hotspur midfielder wilson palacios , as well as an experienced strike force made up of david suazo , who plays for genoa in italy 's serie a , and the ageless carlos pavon .
the 36-year-old pavon is closing in on the two-decade mark in a career which has taken him to 15 clubs and counting , in countries as disparate as italy , spain , colombia , and the united states but the team 's confidence wo n't be helped by news from home that the majority of supporters are horrified by their pre-world cup form .
pressure is building on colombian-born coach reinaldo rueda who is accused by many pundits back in honduras of having no idea as to how he wants the team to play .
with spain looking more dangerous than ever , the swiss capable of either genius or farce under ottmar hitzfeld , and high-scoring chile obsessed with fast-tempo attacking play , the best honduras can hope for is a result against switzerland and damage control against the spaniards and chileans before flying home to face their rabid press .

the south should last longer while nobody will admit to arriving at the world cup just to make up the numbers , the realists among the 32 nations competing will know that it 's highly unlikely that they 'll get out of the group stages . no-one can say what will happen at a world cup .
previous form means little in the heat of battle at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
good teams can have bad days and bad teams can have good ones .
but there are certain teams who arrive with barely a shred of hope of getting out of the group stage .
they may make things difficult for their group opponents and maybe pull off a shock on their way out of the competition , but these are the teams who arrive with no expectations and who are just happy to be there .
there are a number of teams who may struggle in the group stages but here , deutsche welle takes a look at three teams who may already have their return tickets booked for june 26th when the knock-out stage begins .
north korea the team from the one of the world 's most secretive and repressive states is apparently resorting to type in south africa by keeping its preparations and players under cover .
journalists are given short shrift , while training sessions - which every other team has opened to the public - are held behind closed doors .
perhaps north korea are just afraid at showing their group c rivals just how bad they are .
saying that , they are at the world cup for the first time since they famously reached the quarter-finals of the 1966 finals so they ca n't be that bad – can they ?
bildunterschrift : let 's hope that the north korean team are as well-drilled and co-ordinated as their supporters qualifying from the asia conference after beating the likes of saudi arabia , jordan and united arab emirates , and holding their own with their more experienced southern neighbors , north korea – known as the chollima , a mythical horse too swift to be mounted – start with a clean slate , just like everyone else at the 2010 world cup .
but after failing to make the finals at any point in the last 44 years and finding themselves in the " group of death " with brazil , portugal and the ivory coast , it does n't matter how good or bad they are , the smart money is on north korea heading home after three games .
the team , ranked 105th in the world , is made up predominantly of players who feature in north korean teams with only a handful playing outside of the ironhanded communist state .
jong tae-se , known as asia 's wayne rooney , and an yong-hak play in japan 's j-league while striker hong yong-jo plays for russia 's fc rostov .
such is the nature of the country 's regime , very little is known about the rest of the team .
new zealand coming from one of the most laid-back countries on earth , the all whites arrive in south africa under no illusions .
faced with a group featuring world champions italy , paraguay and slovakia , the new zealand team accepts that their world cup is likely to end at the group stage .
this will not stop them from giving their all and enjoying the experience to the fullest .
bildunterschrift : the all whites - here in all black - may not be world beaters but they might make it harder for others however , instead of arriving expecting to get thrashed , the all whites are quietly confident that they can at least give their group f opponents a few headaches after a 1-0 friendly victory over serbia and feisty defeats to chile , to whom they lost 2-0 , and a close 2-1 loss to oceania rivals australia .
while they might not be heading for knock-out stage qualification themselves , their involvement in the tournament may at least dictate who out of their group opponents ' progress .
the minnows from the cinematic middle earth have only featured in one other word cup , in spain in 1982 , when they lost all three matches .
much like what is expected from this tournament , the all whites gave a good account of themselves in a difficult group featuring brazil , the soviet union and scotland .
honduras if facing one of the world cup favorites , a plucky european battler , and one of the best teams in south america -lrb- on current form -rrb- is n't bad enough , honduras arrive in south africa without a win to their name since january 's 2-1 victory over the united states .
they recently struggled in a goalless draw with azerbaijan , labored to a 2-2 draw against belarus and also got beaten 3-0 by non-qualifier romania in their final friendly before heading to the world cup .
getting the type of results to beat spain , switzerland and chile to qualify from group h may be a tall order for honduras on current form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavon and co. are already being written off back home there is quality in the side , which features tottenham hotspur midfielder wilson palacios , as well as an experienced strike force made up of david suazo , who plays for genoa in italy 's serie a , and the ageless carlos pavon .
the 36-year-old pavon is closing in on the two-decade mark in a career which has taken him to 15 clubs and counting , in countries as disparate as italy , spain , colombia , and the united states but the team 's confidence wo n't be helped by news from home that the majority of supporters are horrified by their pre-world cup form .
pressure is building on colombian-born coach reinaldo rueda who is accused by many pundits back in honduras of having no idea as to how he wants the team to play .
with spain looking more dangerous than ever , the swiss capable of either genius or farce under ottmar hitzfeld , and high-scoring chile obsessed with fast-tempo attacking play , the best honduras can hope for is a result against switzerland and damage control against the spaniards and chileans before flying home to face their rabid press .

the information implicates as many as 4,450 people with accounts with ubs . swiss lawmakers have backed a deal with the us that would see banking giant ubs forced to hand over data on 4,450 us clients suspected of tax evasion .
the swiss and us governments , along with switzerland 's largest bank ubs , had agreed the deal in 2009 , but it needed parliamentary approval after the swiss supreme court called its legality into question .
switzerland has long faced criticism from the international community over its secretive banking laws that protect the identities of account holders with banks such as ubs .
last week it seemed the deal may have been dead in the water after parties from across the political spectrum in switzerland voted against the government-brokered agreement .
approval of the deal - by 81 votes to 61 , with 53 lawmakers abstaining - was reached after the lower house was asked to hold a second vote .
technical details remain to be ironed out and the proposal may still be put to the swiss public in a referendum before it finally becomes law .
approval of the deal could go a long way to settling lawsuits by us authorities and could save switzerland and several of its banks considerable sums of money in legal fees .

but at home , it 's struggling to juggle powerful business interests with efforts to protect its threatened rainforest . brazil is considered one of the key countries in global efforts to protect the climate .
the destruction of the rain forest alone is said to be responsible for around half of brazil 's greenhouse gas emissions .
the latin american country is the world 's fifth-largest polluter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of the chainsaw is increasingly part of daily life in the rainforest brazil 's president luiz inacio lula da silva reportedly wants to reduce the amount of amazon rain forest being cleared by 80 percent by 2020 .
but lula insists that the main responsibility for sustainable climate protection lies with the united nations .
following the failure of global climate talks in copenhagen last december , lula reportedly urged un secretary-general ban ki moon during a private meeting to press for a global agreement .
lula said the un is the right forum for discussions about climate change .
controversial dam project lula 's policy on protecting the environment and the rain forest became apparent in early february when brazil 's environment agency ibama approved the construction of a controversial hydro-electric dam belo monte in the middle of the amazon rain forest .
when it is completed , belo monte will be the third largest hydro-electric dam in the world , after the three gorges in china and itaipu , which is jointly run by brazil and paraguay .
it is expected to provide electricity to 23 million brazilian homes .
but residents as well as environmental activists have protested the building of the mega dam in the brazilian state of para .
the justice ministry in para has even tried to prevent the project but lula 's government has stood firm and pushed the project , estimated to cost billions .
construction is slated to begin later in 2010 - a year in which brazil holds general elections .
some 20,000 indigenous people are to be resettled and some 516 square kilometers -lrb- 199 square miles -rrb- of rain forest are to be flooded for the dam 's construction .
business interests damaging rain forest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainforest is being cleared away to make room for lucrative cattle ranching despite pledges by lula 's government to protect the rain forest and the global climate , tree-cutting and the clearing of forests to make way for pastures and cultivation of fields is continuing .
it 's no surprise considering that one of brazil 's leading exports includes beef used in burgers in fast food chains around the world .
that has made cattle ranching more profitable for farmers and encouraged them to deforest .
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations -lrb- fao -rrb- said in march that these business interests have led brazil to sacrifice an average of 26,000 square kilometers -lrb- 10,040 square miles -rrb- of forest each year in the past decade .
the rapid pace of deforestation has done irreparable damage to the so-called " air conditioner " of the world , as environmental activists call the rainforest .
the amazon acts as a " carbon sink , " absorbing carbon dioxide but once the trees are cut down , this absorption stops .
often the wood is burned , releasing carbon , and the loss of forest cover can also lead to carbon release from the soil .
the forest also releases enough water to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration to influence world climate patterns .
a ray of hope the gtz , a german state-owned organization working for sustainable development worldwide , says that the environment laws passed in brazil so far ca n't stop the destruction of the country 's tropical forests .
it estimates that around 680,000 square kilometers -lrb- 262,550 square miles -rrb- of rain forest in the amazon or 17 percent of its original area has been destroyed so far .
along the atlantic coast , just seven percent of rain forest has been preserved .
bildunterschrift : comparative satellite images highlight the extent of the damage in the brazilian state of rondonia the project " amazon region protected area " -lrb- arpa -rrb- , which is supported by germany , provides a ray of hope .
it was founded by lula 's predecessor fernando henrique cardoso who , in 1998 , vowed to designate 12 percent of the rain forest as an officially protected zone by 2012 .
that has now been postponed to 2016 and there are plans to declare the entire 600,000 square kilometers -lrb- 231,660 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest as a protected zone by then .
some progress has already been made .
so far around 390,000 square kilometers -lrb- 150,580 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest has been marked as a federally-protected zone .
but the gtz says that only half of that - just four percent of the amazon rain forest - is strictly protected . that 's too less , according to the group .
critics trace the lowest rate of deforestation in 2009 to the global financial crisis .
" the demand for beef , soya and wood has dramatically fallen , " paulo adario of greenpeace said .
but he added that slowing deforestation has little to do with efforts to protect the climate .
that means in the worst-case scenario , the brazilian rainforest faces another wave of erosion as soon as world markets begin clamoring for brazil 's exports again .

but at home , it 's struggling to juggle powerful business interests with efforts to protect its threatened rainforest . brazil is considered one of the key countries in global efforts to protect the climate .
the destruction of the rain forest alone is said to be responsible for around half of brazil 's greenhouse gas emissions .
the latin american country is the world 's fifth-largest polluter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of the chainsaw is increasingly part of daily life in the rainforest brazil 's president luiz inacio lula da silva reportedly wants to reduce the amount of amazon rain forest being cleared by 80 percent by 2020 .
but lula insists that the main responsibility for sustainable climate protection lies with the united nations .
following the failure of global climate talks in copenhagen last december , lula reportedly urged un secretary-general ban ki moon during a private meeting to press for a global agreement .
lula said the un is the right forum for discussions about climate change .
controversial dam project lula 's policy on protecting the environment and the rain forest became apparent in early february when brazil 's environment agency ibama approved the construction of a controversial hydro-electric dam belo monte in the middle of the amazon rain forest .
when it is completed , belo monte will be the third largest hydro-electric dam in the world , after the three gorges in china and itaipu , which is jointly run by brazil and paraguay .
it is expected to provide electricity to 23 million brazilian homes .
but residents as well as environmental activists have protested the building of the mega dam in the brazilian state of para .
the justice ministry in para has even tried to prevent the project but lula 's government has stood firm and pushed the project , estimated to cost billions .
construction is slated to begin later in 2010 - a year in which brazil holds general elections .
some 20,000 indigenous people are to be resettled and some 516 square kilometers -lrb- 199 square miles -rrb- of rain forest are to be flooded for the dam 's construction .

the information implicates as many as 4,450 people with accounts with ubs . swiss lawmakers have backed a deal with the us that would see banking giant ubs forced to hand over data on 4,450 us clients suspected of tax evasion .
the swiss and us governments , along with switzerland 's largest bank ubs , had agreed the deal in 2009 , but it needed parliamentary approval after the swiss supreme court called its legality into question .
switzerland has long faced criticism from the international community over its secretive banking laws that protect the identities of account holders with banks such as ubs .
last week it seemed the deal may have been dead in the water after parties from across the political spectrum in switzerland voted against the government-brokered agreement .
approval of the deal - by 81 votes to 61 , with 53 lawmakers abstaining - was reached after the lower house was asked to hold a second vote .
technical details remain to be ironed out and the proposal may still be put to the swiss public in a referendum before it finally becomes law .
approval of the deal could go a long way to settling lawsuits by us authorities and could save switzerland and several of its banks considerable sums of money in legal fees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : oil spill in the gulf of mexico the oil disaster the world prefers to ignore bp oil spill must have global consequences , says former un expert obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist americans vent anger over oil spill differently from europeans environment -pipe- 15.06.2010 full oil spill compensation looks increasingly unlikely großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama is concluding a two day tour of affected areas in combating the gulf of mexcio oil spill , bp has resorted to controversial methods of distancing itself from negative publicity .
critics fear full compensation for environmental and economic damage is unlikely . more than six weeks after the now infamous sinking of the deepwater horizon oil rig in the gulf of mexico , efforts to staunch crude oil flowing from an underwater well have only partially succeeded .
meanwhile , the environmental and financial tolls of the catastrophe have yet to be fully assessed .
tourism and fishing industries along the gulf of mexico have suffered devastating effects as oil washes ashore and vast areas of water are polluted , killing wildlife .
bp has stopped referring to the catastrophe using the name of the " deepwater horizon " rig in favor of using the short-form name of the well it dug , " mc252 . "
it has also limited press access to affected areas , limited the release of information and bought up spill-related online search terms at major search engines .
obama foresees policy changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said the spill will shape future environment and energy policies w hile bp has already agreed to some financial compensation , skeptics doubt the full costs of the spill will ever be recovered .
currently bp is collecting about 15,000 barrels of oil a day – about half the amount believed to be leaking .
the company 's latest plan follows pressure from the obama administration and calls for more than 50,000 barrels a day to be collected by the end of june .
the well is expected to continue leaking until bp completes the first of two relief wells in august .
obama said in a recent interview the spill would alter us policy during coming years .
he has also lamented the threat posed to the gulf of mexico coastline with its wildlife-filled wetlands , beaches and waters teeming with shrimps , crabs and fish .
" in the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9/11 , i think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come , " he told the washington-based news organization politico .
fair compensation doubted a number of ngos fear that local populations and ecosystems will ultimately shoulder the catastrophe 's most significant burdens while bp minimizes losses for itself and its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers cleaning up spilled oil may later suffer health problems greenpeace spokeswoman cindy baxter said she expects a scenario similar to the aftermath of the 1989 exxon valdez spill , during which 40,000 tons of crude oil leaked into alaska 's prince william sound .
that resulted in a 19-year legal process over a five-billion-dollar compensation deal .
" exxon has taken it through the courts , and through the courts , and through the courts .
the original five billion dollars ?
that estimated amount of compensation has now been reduced to $ 500 million .
people who wanted compensation died looking for it .
that includes workers who were working on the spill and have had huge amounts of health problems from working with the dispersants that they used , " she told deutsche welle .
economic interests at risk in addition to the damage caused by the current disaster , experts say prospecting for fossil fuels will likely become riskier in the future as energy demand rises and easily accessible resources dwindle .
advocates for renewable energy sources have been quick to point this out .
felix matthes , an expert on renewable energy at the berlin institute for applied ecology , says aggressive development of renewable energy infrastructure is a necessary investment which can be unified with economic interests .
" this catastrophe in the gulf of mexico has made it clear that the current use of energy – especially as accessing raw materials becomes ever more complicated , and this access means disturbing ever more delicate ecosystems – can come at a high cost , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp may shirk fully compensating affected locals like fishermen but the global economy is still based on oil , and the oil industry enjoys political protections .
the united states ' 1990 oil pollution act , signed into law by president george bush sr. , limits liability in the case of a spill to $ 75 million .
similarly , louisiana 's senator mary landrieu has taken a stance protecting the oil industry as a whole .
david cadman of the organization local governments for sustainability said he believes bp has failed to put enough emphasis on cleanup efforts .
" the previous bush administration basically limited the liability of the oil companies in case of an accident , and i think that 's going to come home to roost .
all of a sudden we 're going to see the bills , and there 's going to be a great fight as to who should pay those bills .
and i suspect bp is going to say : ' this is the agreement we had .
we pay up to this and no more . " '

the information implicates as many as 4,450 people with accounts with ubs . swiss lawmakers have backed a deal with the us that would see banking giant ubs forced to hand over data on 4,450 us clients suspected of tax evasion .
the swiss and us governments , along with switzerland 's largest bank ubs , had agreed the deal in 2009 , but it needed parliamentary approval after the swiss supreme court called its legality into question .
switzerland has long faced criticism from the international community over its secretive banking laws that protect the identities of account holders with banks such as ubs .
last week it seemed the deal may have been dead in the water after parties from across the political spectrum in switzerland voted against the government-brokered agreement .
approval of the deal - by 81 votes to 61 , with 53 lawmakers abstaining - was reached after the lower house was asked to hold a second vote .
technical details remain to be ironed out and the proposal may still be put to the swiss public in a referendum before it finally becomes law .
approval of the deal could go a long way to settling lawsuits by us authorities and could save switzerland and several of its banks considerable sums of money in legal fees .

the report concludes that british troops were " unjustified " in firing on protestors on that day in 1972 . british prime minister david cameron has apologized on behalf of the british government for the ' bloody sunday ' massacre in northern ireland in 1972 that left 14 civilian protesters dead at the hands of british troops .
cameron presented the results of a massive 12-year inquiry into the incident to parliament on tuesday , saying that the events of bloody sunday were in no way justified .
" what happened should never , ever , have happened , " cameron said .
" some members of our armed forces acted wrongly . "
initial reports made in 1972 showed that british troops had acted appropriately when they fired on catholic civilians in londonderry .
at the time , the troops indicated that they had fired on civilians who were armed .
however , cameron said that this was not the case and added that some troops had deliberately made false statements about the shootings to make it appear that they had been justified in firing .
the report concludes that the british troops fired first and were unprovoked .
" the government is ultimately responsible for the conduct of the armed forces .
and for that , on behalf of the government , indeed on behalf of our country , i am deeply sorry , " cameron said .

that 's led to huge environmental destruction .
now , efforts are on to protect the rainforest . project goal : to protect the amazon rainforest project size : 600,000 square kilometers -lrb- 231,660 square miles -rrb- of forest by 2016 investment : around 31 million euros -lrb- $ 38 million -rrb- by the german ministry for economic cooperation and development and the german environment ministry the amazonian rainforest , known as the " world 's lung , " is hurtling towards destruction .
soya farms , infrastructure projects and new settlements are encroaching on the forest .

that 's why there are plans to designate large parts of the rain forest as specially protected zones .
the initiative comes from the residents themselves , who have commited to protecting the " verde para sempre " region .

but at home , it 's struggling to juggle powerful business interests with efforts to protect its threatened rainforest . brazil is considered one of the key countries in global efforts to protect the climate .
the destruction of the rain forest alone is said to be responsible for around half of brazil 's greenhouse gas emissions .
the latin american country is the world 's fifth-largest polluter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of the chainsaw is increasingly part of daily life in the rainforest brazil 's president luiz inacio lula da silva reportedly wants to reduce the amount of amazon rain forest being cleared by 80 percent by 2020 .
but lula insists that the main responsibility for sustainable climate protection lies with the united nations .
following the failure of global climate talks in copenhagen last december , lula reportedly urged un secretary-general ban ki moon during a private meeting to press for a global agreement .
lula said the un is the right forum for discussions about climate change .
controversial dam project lula 's policy on protecting the environment and the rain forest became apparent in early february when brazil 's environment agency ibama approved the construction of a controversial hydro-electric dam belo monte in the middle of the amazon rain forest .
when it is completed , belo monte will be the third largest hydro-electric dam in the world , after the three gorges in china and itaipu , which is jointly run by brazil and paraguay .
it is expected to provide electricity to 23 million brazilian homes .
but residents as well as environmental activists have protested the building of the mega dam in the brazilian state of para .
the justice ministry in para has even tried to prevent the project but lula 's government has stood firm and pushed the project , estimated to cost billions .
construction is slated to begin later in 2010 - a year in which brazil holds general elections .
some 20,000 indigenous people are to be resettled and some 516 square kilometers -lrb- 199 square miles -rrb- of rain forest are to be flooded for the dam 's construction .
business interests damaging rain forest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainforest is being cleared away to make room for lucrative cattle ranching despite pledges by lula 's government to protect the rain forest and the global climate , tree-cutting and the clearing of forests to make way for pastures and cultivation of fields is continuing .
it 's no surprise considering that one of brazil 's leading exports includes beef used in burgers in fast food chains around the world .
that has made cattle ranching more profitable for farmers and encouraged them to deforest .
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations -lrb- fao -rrb- said in march that these business interests have led brazil to sacrifice an average of 26,000 square kilometers -lrb- 10,040 square miles -rrb- of forest each year in the past decade .
the rapid pace of deforestation has done irreparable damage to the so-called " air conditioner " of the world , as environmental activists call the rainforest .
the amazon acts as a " carbon sink , " absorbing carbon dioxide but once the trees are cut down , this absorption stops .
often the wood is burned , releasing carbon , and the loss of forest cover can also lead to carbon release from the soil .
the forest also releases enough water to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration to influence world climate patterns .
a ray of hope the gtz , a german state-owned organization working for sustainable development worldwide , says that the environment laws passed in brazil so far ca n't stop the destruction of the country 's tropical forests .
it estimates that around 680,000 square kilometers -lrb- 262,550 square miles -rrb- of rain forest in the amazon or 17 percent of its original area has been destroyed so far .
along the atlantic coast , just seven percent of rain forest has been preserved .
bildunterschrift : comparative satellite images highlight the extent of the damage in the brazilian state of rondonia the project " amazon region protected area " -lrb- arpa -rrb- , which is supported by germany , provides a ray of hope .
it was founded by lula 's predecessor fernando henrique cardoso who , in 1998 , vowed to designate 12 percent of the rain forest as an officially protected zone by 2012 .
that has now been postponed to 2016 and there are plans to declare the entire 600,000 square kilometers -lrb- 231,660 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest as a protected zone by then .
some progress has already been made .
so far around 390,000 square kilometers -lrb- 150,580 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest has been marked as a federally-protected zone .
but the gtz says that only half of that - just four percent of the amazon rain forest - is strictly protected . that 's too less , according to the group .
critics trace the lowest rate of deforestation in 2009 to the global financial crisis .
" the demand for beef , soya and wood has dramatically fallen , " paulo adario of greenpeace said .
but he added that slowing deforestation has little to do with efforts to protect the climate .
that means in the worst-case scenario , the brazilian rainforest faces another wave of erosion as soon as world markets begin clamoring for brazil 's exports again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : oil spill in the gulf of mexico the oil disaster the world prefers to ignore bp oil spill must have global consequences , says former un expert obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist full oil spill compensation looks increasingly unlikely disasters -pipe- 15.06.2010 americans vent anger over oil spill differently from europeans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a lack of mass protests by fishermen in the gulf states compared to earlier oil disasters in europe where thousands took to the streets , the outcry in the us over the bp spill seems rather restrained .
but the lack of mass rallies should n't be seen as a lack of public anger . when the oil tanker erika sank and broke apart off the french coast in december 1999 , the public was outraged .
an estimated crowd of 20,000 demonstrated at a rally in nantes against french oil giant total whose leased vessel had spilled approximately three million gallons of oil .
the disaster killed as many as 75,000 birds and spoiled around 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- of the coast .
three years later when the oil tanker prestige sank off the galician coast causing spain 's biggest environmental catastrophe in history , the spaniards took the the streets as well .
at least 12,000 demonstrators gathered at one rally in barcelona alone to voice their anger over the crisis management of the spanish government .
the prestige 's spill of around 20 million gallons of oil contaminated large parts of the french and spanish coasts .
the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico dwarfs both the erika and prestige disasters .
according to recent revised estimates the deepwater horizon rig has already leaked between 42 and 100 million gallons into the water with no end in sight .
that means the bp leak is causing a spill the size of the exxon valez disaster every five to 13 days .
it is by far the worst environmental disaster in us history .
few protestors at bp headquarters and yet after weeks of uninterrupted spilling , a recent rally at bp 's washington headquarters according to media reports attracted only a few dozen protesters .
a protest event in new orleans , which is directly affected by the spill , also drew only some 200 people according to media reports . " that 's not the us style , " michael e. kraft , professor of public and environmental affairs at the university of wisconsin-green bay , told deutsche welle .
" people do n't protest like that over almost anything .
but i would n't take that to mean that there is a lack of public concern . "
his colleague christoph goerg , an expert for global environmental governance at the leipzig-based helmholtz centre for environmental research , agrees : " i do n't think that the environmental consciousness in the us is generally less-developed than in europe . "
goerg believes that the absence of mass gatherings is a characteristic of the political culture in the us and the ability and the willingness of the people to articulate themselves publicly .
" what is definitely different especially compared to france , but also spain , is that in those countries there are very strong lobby groups of fishermen , but also farmers who are able not only to articulate themselves , but also to organize the people most affected by the spill and give them a public platform . " opinion polls show frustration of crisis management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of spaniards demonstrated after the prestige disaster while americans may not flock to the streets , numerous opinion surveys show that the us public is in fact deeply worried about the disaster .
seventy percent of americans , according to one poll , disapprove of bp 's handling of the crisis .
president barack obama 's crisis management has also been heavily criticized .
there are also indications of a significant shift in public opinion over offshore drilling .
in florida , one of the worst affected states , according to a new poll 51 percent of floridians now oppose new offshore drilling .
before the disaster 66 percent were in favor of drilling and only 27 against it .
but is there no way to gauge the public sentiment beyond mere surveys ?
sure , say the experts .
just log on to the internet or turn on the television .
since the explosion on the oil rig , news crews are present covering the spill around the clock .
comedians like bill maher and jon stewart have targeted bp and the obama administration repeatedly .
and in the gulf states many locals have displayed placards and posters showing their frustration over bp , but also over the government 's response .
anti-bp art on the internet on the internet new groups and websites devoted to the disaster are springing up every day .
one of the biggest ones , the boycott bp group on facebook , attracts thousands of new supporters daily and currently has more than 600,000 fans .
and at the popular blog huffington post readers can vent their anger with anti-bp art .
" the public sphere is not the street alone anymore , but also the internet with its various media outlets , " explains goerg .
" a lot of public discourse is carried out over the internet in a new kind of way that also creates new forms of publicity . "
bildunterschrift : oil companies like bp face tougher regulations and higher liability this , argues goerg , has both positive and negative aspects .
" when one attends a rally with others this is something different than when one is active on twitter or voices an opinion somewhere else on the internet , " he says .
" that is more difficult during a public rally , but on the other hand , the connection with others is stronger and one feels more like being part of a group . " the most important benchmark for the effectiveness of public sentiment over the oil spill though , argues kraft , may not be how many people attend a rally , but whether the disaster affects change .
" i think you will see some real public policy changes .
almost certainly there will be very substantial increases in environmental and safety restrictions . "
and , add the experts , one of the most important things to do is to make sure that companies like bp have a very strong financial interest in ensuring that something like this never happens again .
this process has already begun , notes kraft : " the price of bp stock has plummeted since the disaster by something like 40 percent or $ 73 billion -lrb- 60 billion euros -rrb- . so the reaction here may be a little more subtle than it is in europe . "

the report concludes that british troops were " unjustified " in firing on protestors on that day in 1972 . british prime minister david cameron has apologized on behalf of the british government for the ' bloody sunday ' massacre in northern ireland in 1972 that left 14 civilian protesters dead at the hands of british troops .
cameron presented the results of a massive 12-year inquiry into the incident to parliament on tuesday , saying that the events of bloody sunday were in no way justified .
" what happened should never , ever , have happened , " cameron said .
" some members of our armed forces acted wrongly . "
initial reports made in 1972 showed that british troops had acted appropriately when they fired on catholic civilians in londonderry .
at the time , the troops indicated that they had fired on civilians who were armed .
however , cameron said that this was not the case and added that some troops had deliberately made false statements about the shootings to make it appear that they had been justified in firing .
the report concludes that the british troops fired first and were unprovoked .
" the government is ultimately responsible for the conduct of the armed forces .
and for that , on behalf of the government , indeed on behalf of our country , i am deeply sorry , " cameron said .

the report concludes that british troops were " unjustified " in firing on protestors on that day in 1972 . british prime minister david cameron has apologized on behalf of the british government for the ' bloody sunday ' massacre in northern ireland in 1972 that left 14 civilian protesters dead at the hands of british troops .
cameron presented the results of a massive 12-year inquiry into the incident to parliament on tuesday , saying that the events of bloody sunday were in no way justified .
" what happened should never , ever , have happened , " cameron said .
" some members of our armed forces acted wrongly . "
initial reports made in 1972 showed that british troops had acted appropriately when they fired on catholic civilians in londonderry .
at the time , the troops indicated that they had fired on civilians who were armed .
however , cameron said that this was not the case and added that some troops had deliberately made false statements about the shootings to make it appear that they had been justified in firing .
the report concludes that the british troops fired first and were unprovoked .
" the government is ultimately responsible for the conduct of the armed forces .
and for that , on behalf of the government , indeed on behalf of our country , i am deeply sorry , " cameron said .

the country 's development minister wants to merge them under a single name . development minister dirk niebel announced tuesday that he wants to consolidate three of germany 's international development agencies into one entity , to be called the german association for international cooperation .
niebel said the move would increase efficiency and reduce red tape .
the new institution would include german technical aid organization gtz , the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- , and the international capacity-building agency inwent .
it would officially come into existence on january 1 , 2011 - if the federal cabinet approves the change in a vote scheduled for july 7 .
the three agencies currently employ a total of 17,000 people worldwide .
their replacement would have its headquarters in bonn and a second office in eschborn , near frankfurt .
inwent would retain its 14 regional offices in germany and others maintained with partners throughout the world .
savings will remain in the development budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel 's plans for reform of germany 's development infrastructure are controversial niebel , a member of germany 's pro-business free democratic party , told german television that the move was completely separate from the federal government 's recently announced cost-cutting measures .
" it 's natural , of course , that with increasingly strained public finance , things must be made more efficient , " niebel said .
niebel said he had talked to the finance minister about allowing the savings from the consolidation to remain within the ministry budget - so that although the ministry would not see any funding increases until 2014 , it would n't see any budget cuts , either .
the plan has been criticized by the opposition social democrats ' spokesperson for development policy , sascha raabe .
raabe told the protestant news service -lrb- epd -rrb- that niebel lacked the courage for the required major reforms , and was instead making cosmetic changes .
" that is not going to help our partners in the world , " raabe said .

critics fear full compensation for environmental and economic damage is unlikely . more than six weeks after the now infamous sinking of the deepwater horizon oil rig in the gulf of mexico , efforts to staunch crude oil flowing from an underwater well have only partially succeeded .
meanwhile , the environmental and financial tolls of the catastrophe have yet to be fully assessed .
tourism and fishing industries along the gulf of mexico have suffered devastating effects as oil washes ashore and vast areas of water are polluted , killing wildlife .
bp has stopped referring to the catastrophe using the name of the " deepwater horizon " rig in favor of using the short-form name of the well it dug , " mc252 . "
it has also limited press access to affected areas , limited the release of information and bought up spill-related online search terms at major search engines .
obama foresees policy changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said the spill will shape future environment and energy policies w hile bp has already agreed to some financial compensation , skeptics doubt the full costs of the spill will ever be recovered .
currently bp is collecting about 15,000 barrels of oil a day – about half the amount believed to be leaking .
the company 's latest plan follows pressure from the obama administration and calls for more than 50,000 barrels a day to be collected by the end of june .
the well is expected to continue leaking until bp completes the first of two relief wells in august .
obama said in a recent interview the spill would alter us policy during coming years .
he has also lamented the threat posed to the gulf of mexico coastline with its wildlife-filled wetlands , beaches and waters teeming with shrimps , crabs and fish .
" in the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9/11 , i think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come , " he told the washington-based news organization politico .
fair compensation doubted a number of ngos fear that local populations and ecosystems will ultimately shoulder the catastrophe 's most significant burdens while bp minimizes losses for itself and its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers cleaning up spilled oil may later suffer health problems greenpeace spokeswoman cindy baxter said she expects a scenario similar to the aftermath of the 1989 exxon valdez spill , during which 40,000 tons of crude oil leaked into alaska 's prince william sound .
that resulted in a 19-year legal process over a five-billion-dollar compensation deal .
" exxon has taken it through the courts , and through the courts , and through the courts .
the original five billion dollars ?
that estimated amount of compensation has now been reduced to $ 500 million .
people who wanted compensation died looking for it .
that includes workers who were working on the spill and have had huge amounts of health problems from working with the dispersants that they used , " she told deutsche welle .
economic interests at risk in addition to the damage caused by the current disaster , experts say prospecting for fossil fuels will likely become riskier in the future as energy demand rises and easily accessible resources dwindle .
advocates for renewable energy sources have been quick to point this out .
felix matthes , an expert on renewable energy at the berlin institute for applied ecology , says aggressive development of renewable energy infrastructure is a necessary investment which can be unified with economic interests .
" this catastrophe in the gulf of mexico has made it clear that the current use of energy – especially as accessing raw materials becomes ever more complicated , and this access means disturbing ever more delicate ecosystems – can come at a high cost , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp may shirk fully compensating affected locals like fishermen but the global economy is still based on oil , and the oil industry enjoys political protections .
the united states ' 1990 oil pollution act , signed into law by president george bush sr. , limits liability in the case of a spill to $ 75 million .
similarly , louisiana 's senator mary landrieu has taken a stance protecting the oil industry as a whole .
david cadman of the organization local governments for sustainability said he believes bp has failed to put enough emphasis on cleanup efforts .
" the previous bush administration basically limited the liability of the oil companies in case of an accident , and i think that 's going to come home to roost .
all of a sudden we 're going to see the bills , and there 's going to be a great fight as to who should pay those bills .

critics fear full compensation for environmental and economic damage is unlikely . more than six weeks after the now infamous sinking of the deepwater horizon oil rig in the gulf of mexico , efforts to staunch crude oil flowing from an underwater well have only partially succeeded .
meanwhile , the environmental and financial tolls of the catastrophe have yet to be fully assessed .
tourism and fishing industries along the gulf of mexico have suffered devastating effects as oil washes ashore and vast areas of water are polluted , killing wildlife .
bp has stopped referring to the catastrophe using the name of the " deepwater horizon " rig in favor of using the short-form name of the well it dug , " mc252 . "
it has also limited press access to affected areas , limited the release of information and bought up spill-related online search terms at major search engines .
obama foresees policy changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said the spill will shape future environment and energy policies w hile bp has already agreed to some financial compensation , skeptics doubt the full costs of the spill will ever be recovered .
currently bp is collecting about 15,000 barrels of oil a day – about half the amount believed to be leaking .
the company 's latest plan follows pressure from the obama administration and calls for more than 50,000 barrels a day to be collected by the end of june .
the well is expected to continue leaking until bp completes the first of two relief wells in august .
obama said in a recent interview the spill would alter us policy during coming years .
he has also lamented the threat posed to the gulf of mexico coastline with its wildlife-filled wetlands , beaches and waters teeming with shrimps , crabs and fish .
" in the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9/11 , i think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come , " he told the washington-based news organization politico .
fair compensation doubted a number of ngos fear that local populations and ecosystems will ultimately shoulder the catastrophe 's most significant burdens while bp minimizes losses for itself and its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers cleaning up spilled oil may later suffer health problems greenpeace spokeswoman cindy baxter said she expects a scenario similar to the aftermath of the 1989 exxon valdez spill , during which 40,000 tons of crude oil leaked into alaska 's prince william sound .
that resulted in a 19-year legal process over a five-billion-dollar compensation deal .
" exxon has taken it through the courts , and through the courts , and through the courts .
the original five billion dollars ?
that estimated amount of compensation has now been reduced to $ 500 million .
people who wanted compensation died looking for it .
that includes workers who were working on the spill and have had huge amounts of health problems from working with the dispersants that they used , " she told deutsche welle .
economic interests at risk in addition to the damage caused by the current disaster , experts say prospecting for fossil fuels will likely become riskier in the future as energy demand rises and easily accessible resources dwindle .
advocates for renewable energy sources have been quick to point this out .
felix matthes , an expert on renewable energy at the berlin institute for applied ecology , says aggressive development of renewable energy infrastructure is a necessary investment which can be unified with economic interests .
" this catastrophe in the gulf of mexico has made it clear that the current use of energy – especially as accessing raw materials becomes ever more complicated , and this access means disturbing ever more delicate ecosystems – can come at a high cost , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp may shirk fully compensating affected locals like fishermen but the global economy is still based on oil , and the oil industry enjoys political protections .
the united states ' 1990 oil pollution act , signed into law by president george bush sr. , limits liability in the case of a spill to $ 75 million .
similarly , louisiana 's senator mary landrieu has taken a stance protecting the oil industry as a whole .
david cadman of the organization local governments for sustainability said he believes bp has failed to put enough emphasis on cleanup efforts .
" the previous bush administration basically limited the liability of the oil companies in case of an accident , and i think that 's going to come home to roost .

the report concludes that british troops were " unjustified " in firing on protestors on that day in 1972 . british prime minister david cameron has apologized on behalf of the british government for the ' bloody sunday ' massacre in northern ireland in 1972 that left 14 civilian protesters dead at the hands of british troops .
cameron presented the results of a massive 12-year inquiry into the incident to parliament on tuesday , saying that the events of bloody sunday were in no way justified .
" what happened should never , ever , have happened , " cameron said .
" some members of our armed forces acted wrongly . "
initial reports made in 1972 showed that british troops had acted appropriately when they fired on catholic civilians in londonderry .
at the time , the troops indicated that they had fired on civilians who were armed .
however , cameron said that this was not the case and added that some troops had deliberately made false statements about the shootings to make it appear that they had been justified in firing .
the report concludes that the british troops fired first and were unprovoked .
" the government is ultimately responsible for the conduct of the armed forces .
and for that , on behalf of the government , indeed on behalf of our country , i am deeply sorry , " cameron said .

the country 's development minister wants to merge them under a single name . development minister dirk niebel announced tuesday that he wants to consolidate three of germany 's international development agencies into one entity , to be called the german association for international cooperation .
niebel said the move would increase efficiency and reduce red tape .
the new institution would include german technical aid organization gtz , the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- , and the international capacity-building agency inwent .
it would officially come into existence on january 1 , 2011 - if the federal cabinet approves the change in a vote scheduled for july 7 .
the three agencies currently employ a total of 17,000 people worldwide .
their replacement would have its headquarters in bonn and a second office in eschborn , near frankfurt .
inwent would retain its 14 regional offices in germany and others maintained with partners throughout the world .
savings will remain in the development budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel 's plans for reform of germany 's development infrastructure are controversial niebel , a member of germany 's pro-business free democratic party , told german television that the move was completely separate from the federal government 's recently announced cost-cutting measures .
" it 's natural , of course , that with increasingly strained public finance , things must be made more efficient , " niebel said .
niebel said he had talked to the finance minister about allowing the savings from the consolidation to remain within the ministry budget - so that although the ministry would not see any funding increases until 2014 , it would n't see any budget cuts , either .
the plan has been criticized by the opposition social democrats ' spokesperson for development policy , sascha raabe .
raabe told the protestant news service -lrb- epd -rrb- that niebel lacked the courage for the required major reforms , and was instead making cosmetic changes .
" that is not going to help our partners in the world , " raabe said .

the new institution would include german technical aid organization gtz , the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- , and the international capacity-building agency inwent .
it would officially come into existence on january 1 , 2011 - if the federal cabinet approves the change in a vote scheduled for july 7 .
the three agencies currently employ a total of 17,000 people worldwide .
their replacement would have its headquarters in bonn and a second office in eschborn , near frankfurt .
inwent would retain its 14 regional offices in germany and others maintained with partners throughout the world .
savings will remain in the development budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel 's plans for reform of germany 's development infrastructure are controversial niebel , a member of germany 's pro-business free democratic party , told german television that the move was completely separate from the federal government 's recently announced cost-cutting measures .
" it 's natural , of course , that with increasingly strained public finance , things must be made more efficient , " niebel said .
niebel said he had talked to the finance minister about allowing the savings from the consolidation to remain within the ministry budget - so that although the ministry would not see any funding increases until 2014 , it would n't see any budget cuts , either .
the plan has been criticized by the opposition social democrats ' spokesperson for development policy , sascha raabe .
raabe told the protestant news service -lrb- epd -rrb- that niebel lacked the courage for the required major reforms , and was instead making cosmetic changes .
" that is not going to help our partners in the world , " raabe said .

'
group mates ivory coast and portugal finished scoreless , while a late new zealand goal saved a point against slovakia . in the world cup debut of the so-called ' group of death ' - formally known as group g - brazil emerged on top after its 2-1 win over north korea . perennial world cup favorites brazil dominated possession in the first half but a resolute north korean defense kept coach carlos dunga 's squad from finding the back of the net . brazil kept up the pressure in the second half , continuing to probe north korea 's defense but being turned away every time . that changed in the 55th minute .
brazilian midfielder elano played a through-ball to defender maicon , who fired a nearly sideways shot from less than a meter from the end line .

this time it was elano who took the easy shot following a precision cross from robinho . if history is any guide , it was only a matter of time before one of brazil 's attacks made it through : the brazilians have scored at least one goal in every group stage match of the world cup since 1978 , when they drew 0-0 against spain . north korea pulled one back near the end of the game as forward jong tae se laid down a header in front of defender ji yun nam , who booted the ball over brazilian keeper julio cesar to score in the 89th minute . drogba back in action despite playing a hard-fought match on both sides , neither team in the other group g match between the ivory coast and portugal had a particularly high number of scoring opportunities , and the ones that did come along never resulted in a goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drogba 's broken arm did n't keep him out of the world cup for long one highlight of the game for the ivory coast was the return of their star captain , didier drogba .

the country 's development minister wants to merge them under a single name . development minister dirk niebel announced tuesday that he wants to consolidate three of germany 's international development agencies into one entity , to be called the german association for international cooperation .
niebel said the move would increase efficiency and reduce red tape .
the new institution would include german technical aid organization gtz , the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- , and the international capacity-building agency inwent .
it would officially come into existence on january 1 , 2011 - if the federal cabinet approves the change in a vote scheduled for july 7 .
the three agencies currently employ a total of 17,000 people worldwide .
their replacement would have its headquarters in bonn and a second office in eschborn , near frankfurt .
inwent would retain its 14 regional offices in germany and others maintained with partners throughout the world .
savings will remain in the development budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel 's plans for reform of germany 's development infrastructure are controversial niebel , a member of germany 's pro-business free democratic party , told german television that the move was completely separate from the federal government 's recently announced cost-cutting measures .
" it 's natural , of course , that with increasingly strained public finance , things must be made more efficient , " niebel said .
niebel said he had talked to the finance minister about allowing the savings from the consolidation to remain within the ministry budget - so that although the ministry would not see any funding increases until 2014 , it would n't see any budget cuts , either .
the plan has been criticized by the opposition social democrats ' spokesperson for development policy , sascha raabe .
raabe told the protestant news service -lrb- epd -rrb- that niebel lacked the courage for the required major reforms , and was instead making cosmetic changes .
" that is not going to help our partners in the world , " raabe said .

the report concludes that british troops were " unjustified " in firing on protestors on that day in 1972 . british prime minister david cameron has apologized on behalf of the british government for the ' bloody sunday ' massacre in northern ireland in 1972 that left 14 civilian protesters dead at the hands of british troops .
cameron presented the results of a massive 12-year inquiry into the incident to parliament on tuesday , saying that the events of bloody sunday were in no way justified .
" what happened should never , ever , have happened , " cameron said .
" some members of our armed forces acted wrongly . "
initial reports made in 1972 showed that british troops had acted appropriately when they fired on catholic civilians in londonderry .
at the time , the troops indicated that they had fired on civilians who were armed .
however , cameron said that this was not the case and added that some troops had deliberately made false statements about the shootings to make it appear that they had been justified in firing .
the report concludes that the british troops fired first and were unprovoked .
" the government is ultimately responsible for the conduct of the armed forces .
and for that , on behalf of the government , indeed on behalf of our country , i am deeply sorry , " cameron said .

'
group mates ivory coast and portugal finished scoreless , while a late new zealand goal saved a point against slovakia . in the world cup debut of the so-called ' group of death ' - formally known as group g - brazil emerged on top after its 2-1 win over north korea . perennial world cup favorites brazil dominated possession in the first half but a resolute north korean defense kept coach carlos dunga 's squad from finding the back of the net . brazil kept up the pressure in the second half , continuing to probe north korea 's defense but being turned away every time . that changed in the 55th minute .
brazilian midfielder elano played a through-ball to defender maicon , who fired a nearly sideways shot from less than a meter from the end line .
the ball slipped between north korean keeper ri myong guk and the near post before curving over the line and into the goal . bildunterschrift : north korea was on defense for most of the game the brazilians added a second goal in the 72nd minute .
this time it was elano who took the easy shot following a precision cross from robinho . if history is any guide , it was only a matter of time before one of brazil 's attacks made it through : the brazilians have scored at least one goal in every group stage match of the world cup since 1978 , when they drew 0-0 against spain . north korea pulled one back near the end of the game as forward jong tae se laid down a header in front of defender ji yun nam , who booted the ball over brazilian keeper julio cesar to score in the 89th minute . drogba back in action despite playing a hard-fought match on both sides , neither team in the other group g match between the ivory coast and portugal had a particularly high number of scoring opportunities , and the ones that did come along never resulted in a goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drogba 's broken arm did n't keep him out of the world cup for long one highlight of the game for the ivory coast was the return of their star captain , didier drogba .
the forward broke his arm in a warm-up match against japan 11 days ago , and his status for the group g opener against portugal was questionable . although drogba did n't start , he was subbed in the 66th minute for salomon kalou , a teammate of drogba 's at fc chelsea . the ivory coast 's next match is a big one in the group as they face brazil .
portugal faces north korea on monday . better late than never it took new zealand literally the entire game , but their lone goal against slovakia could n't have come at a better time .
slovakia looked to be on their way to a 1-0 win as the referee indicated three minutes of injury time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reid -lrb- left -rrb- celebrates his last-second goal for new zealand but new zealand put together a hectic offensive sequence after two and a half minutes of injury time and managed to tie the game , salvaging a point in group f with the 1-1 draw . with the final whistle seconds away , new zealand forward shane smeltz delivered a cross to defender winston reid , who connected for a header . slovakia 's goal was nearly identical but came in the 50th minute .
after slowly building up an attack , slovakian forward stanislav sestak launched a curling cross that was right on target for robert vittek to score on a header . the group 's other teams , italy and paraguay , also played to a 1-1 tie on monday night , meaning group f is all square with one point per team . author : matt zuvela editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : oil spill in the gulf of mexico the oil disaster the world prefers to ignore bp oil spill must have global consequences , says former un expert obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist full oil spill compensation looks increasingly unlikely disasters -pipe- 15.06.2010 americans vent anger over oil spill differently from europeans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a lack of mass protests by fishermen in the gulf states compared to earlier oil disasters in europe where thousands took to the streets , the outcry in the us over the bp spill seems rather restrained .
but the lack of mass rallies should n't be seen as a lack of public anger . when the oil tanker erika sank and broke apart off the french coast in december 1999 , the public was outraged .
an estimated crowd of 20,000 demonstrated at a rally in nantes against french oil giant total whose leased vessel had spilled approximately three million gallons of oil .
the disaster killed as many as 75,000 birds and spoiled around 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- of the coast .
three years later when the oil tanker prestige sank off the galician coast causing spain 's biggest environmental catastrophe in history , the spaniards took the the streets as well .
at least 12,000 demonstrators gathered at one rally in barcelona alone to voice their anger over the crisis management of the spanish government .
the prestige 's spill of around 20 million gallons of oil contaminated large parts of the french and spanish coasts .
the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico dwarfs both the erika and prestige disasters .
according to recent revised estimates the deepwater horizon rig has already leaked between 42 and 100 million gallons into the water with no end in sight .
that means the bp leak is causing a spill the size of the exxon valez disaster every five to 13 days .
it is by far the worst environmental disaster in us history .
few protestors at bp headquarters and yet after weeks of uninterrupted spilling , a recent rally at bp 's washington headquarters according to media reports attracted only a few dozen protesters .
a protest event in new orleans , which is directly affected by the spill , also drew only some 200 people according to media reports . " that 's not the us style , " michael e. kraft , professor of public and environmental affairs at the university of wisconsin-green bay , told deutsche welle .
" people do n't protest like that over almost anything .
but i would n't take that to mean that there is a lack of public concern . "
his colleague christoph goerg , an expert for global environmental governance at the leipzig-based helmholtz centre for environmental research , agrees : " i do n't think that the environmental consciousness in the us is generally less-developed than in europe . "
goerg believes that the absence of mass gatherings is a characteristic of the political culture in the us and the ability and the willingness of the people to articulate themselves publicly .
" what is definitely different especially compared to france , but also spain , is that in those countries there are very strong lobby groups of fishermen , but also farmers who are able not only to articulate themselves , but also to organize the people most affected by the spill and give them a public platform . " opinion polls show frustration of crisis management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of spaniards demonstrated after the prestige disaster while americans may not flock to the streets , numerous opinion surveys show that the us public is in fact deeply worried about the disaster .
seventy percent of americans , according to one poll , disapprove of bp 's handling of the crisis .
president barack obama 's crisis management has also been heavily criticized .
there are also indications of a significant shift in public opinion over offshore drilling .
in florida , one of the worst affected states , according to a new poll 51 percent of floridians now oppose new offshore drilling .
before the disaster 66 percent were in favor of drilling and only 27 against it .
but is there no way to gauge the public sentiment beyond mere surveys ?
sure , say the experts .
just log on to the internet or turn on the television .
since the explosion on the oil rig , news crews are present covering the spill around the clock .
comedians like bill maher and jon stewart have targeted bp and the obama administration repeatedly .
and in the gulf states many locals have displayed placards and posters showing their frustration over bp , but also over the government 's response .
anti-bp art on the internet on the internet new groups and websites devoted to the disaster are springing up every day .
one of the biggest ones , the boycott bp group on facebook , attracts thousands of new supporters daily and currently has more than 600,000 fans .
and at the popular blog huffington post readers can vent their anger with anti-bp art .
" the public sphere is not the street alone anymore , but also the internet with its various media outlets , " explains goerg .
" a lot of public discourse is carried out over the internet in a new kind of way that also creates new forms of publicity . "
bildunterschrift : oil companies like bp face tougher regulations and higher liability this , argues goerg , has both positive and negative aspects .
" when one attends a rally with others this is something different than when one is active on twitter or voices an opinion somewhere else on the internet , " he says .
" that is more difficult during a public rally , but on the other hand , the connection with others is stronger and one feels more like being part of a group . " the most important benchmark for the effectiveness of public sentiment over the oil spill though , argues kraft , may not be how many people attend a rally , but whether the disaster affects change .
" i think you will see some real public policy changes .
almost certainly there will be very substantial increases in environmental and safety restrictions . "
and , add the experts , one of the most important things to do is to make sure that companies like bp have a very strong financial interest in ensuring that something like this never happens again .
this process has already begun , notes kraft : " the price of bp stock has plummeted since the disaster by something like 40 percent or $ 73 billion -lrb- 60 billion euros -rrb- . so the reaction here may be a little more subtle than it is in europe . "

but the lack of mass rallies should n't be seen as a lack of public anger . when the oil tanker erika sank and broke apart off the french coast in december 1999 , the public was outraged .
an estimated crowd of 20,000 demonstrated at a rally in nantes against french oil giant total whose leased vessel had spilled approximately three million gallons of oil .
the disaster killed as many as 75,000 birds and spoiled around 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- of the coast .
three years later when the oil tanker prestige sank off the galician coast causing spain 's biggest environmental catastrophe in history , the spaniards took the the streets as well .
at least 12,000 demonstrators gathered at one rally in barcelona alone to voice their anger over the crisis management of the spanish government .
the prestige 's spill of around 20 million gallons of oil contaminated large parts of the french and spanish coasts .
the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico dwarfs both the erika and prestige disasters .
according to recent revised estimates the deepwater horizon rig has already leaked between 42 and 100 million gallons into the water with no end in sight .
that means the bp leak is causing a spill the size of the exxon valez disaster every five to 13 days .
it is by far the worst environmental disaster in us history .
few protestors at bp headquarters and yet after weeks of uninterrupted spilling , a recent rally at bp 's washington headquarters according to media reports attracted only a few dozen protesters .
a protest event in new orleans , which is directly affected by the spill , also drew only some 200 people according to media reports . " that 's not the us style , " michael e. kraft , professor of public and environmental affairs at the university of wisconsin-green bay , told deutsche welle .
" people do n't protest like that over almost anything .
but i would n't take that to mean that there is a lack of public concern . "
his colleague christoph goerg , an expert for global environmental governance at the leipzig-based helmholtz centre for environmental research , agrees : " i do n't think that the environmental consciousness in the us is generally less-developed than in europe . "
goerg believes that the absence of mass gatherings is a characteristic of the political culture in the us and the ability and the willingness of the people to articulate themselves publicly .
" what is definitely different especially compared to france , but also spain , is that in those countries there are very strong lobby groups of fishermen , but also farmers who are able not only to articulate themselves , but also to organize the people most affected by the spill and give them a public platform . " opinion polls show frustration of crisis management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of spaniards demonstrated after the prestige disaster while americans may not flock to the streets , numerous opinion surveys show that the us public is in fact deeply worried about the disaster .
seventy percent of americans , according to one poll , disapprove of bp 's handling of the crisis .
president barack obama 's crisis management has also been heavily criticized .
there are also indications of a significant shift in public opinion over offshore drilling .
in florida , one of the worst affected states , according to a new poll 51 percent of floridians now oppose new offshore drilling .
before the disaster 66 percent were in favor of drilling and only 27 against it .
but is there no way to gauge the public sentiment beyond mere surveys ?
sure , say the experts .
just log on to the internet or turn on the television .
since the explosion on the oil rig , news crews are present covering the spill around the clock .
comedians like bill maher and jon stewart have targeted bp and the obama administration repeatedly .
and in the gulf states many locals have displayed placards and posters showing their frustration over bp , but also over the government 's response .
anti-bp art on the internet on the internet new groups and websites devoted to the disaster are springing up every day .
one of the biggest ones , the boycott bp group on facebook , attracts thousands of new supporters daily and currently has more than 600,000 fans .
and at the popular blog huffington post readers can vent their anger with anti-bp art .
" the public sphere is not the street alone anymore , but also the internet with its various media outlets , " explains goerg .
" a lot of public discourse is carried out over the internet in a new kind of way that also creates new forms of publicity . "
bildunterschrift : oil companies like bp face tougher regulations and higher liability this , argues goerg , has both positive and negative aspects .
" when one attends a rally with others this is something different than when one is active on twitter or voices an opinion somewhere else on the internet , " he says .
" that is more difficult during a public rally , but on the other hand , the connection with others is stronger and one feels more like being part of a group . " the most important benchmark for the effectiveness of public sentiment over the oil spill though , argues kraft , may not be how many people attend a rally , but whether the disaster affects change .
" i think you will see some real public policy changes .
almost certainly there will be very substantial increases in environmental and safety restrictions . "
and , add the experts , one of the most important things to do is to make sure that companies like bp have a very strong financial interest in ensuring that something like this never happens again .
this process has already begun , notes kraft : " the price of bp stock has plummeted since the disaster by something like 40 percent or $ 73 billion -lrb- 60 billion euros -rrb- . so the reaction here may be a little more subtle than it is in europe . "

'
group mates ivory coast and portugal finished scoreless , while a late new zealand goal saved a point against slovakia . in the world cup debut of the so-called ' group of death ' - formally known as group g - brazil emerged on top after its 2-1 win over north korea . perennial world cup favorites brazil dominated possession in the first half but a resolute north korean defense kept coach carlos dunga 's squad from finding the back of the net . brazil kept up the pressure in the second half , continuing to probe north korea 's defense but being turned away every time . that changed in the 55th minute .
brazilian midfielder elano played a through-ball to defender maicon , who fired a nearly sideways shot from less than a meter from the end line .
the ball slipped between north korean keeper ri myong guk and the near post before curving over the line and into the goal . bildunterschrift : north korea was on defense for most of the game the brazilians added a second goal in the 72nd minute .
this time it was elano who took the easy shot following a precision cross from robinho . if history is any guide , it was only a matter of time before one of brazil 's attacks made it through : the brazilians have scored at least one goal in every group stage match of the world cup since 1978 , when they drew 0-0 against spain . north korea pulled one back near the end of the game as forward jong tae se laid down a header in front of defender ji yun nam , who booted the ball over brazilian keeper julio cesar to score in the 89th minute . drogba back in action despite playing a hard-fought match on both sides , neither team in the other group g match between the ivory coast and portugal had a particularly high number of scoring opportunities , and the ones that did come along never resulted in a goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drogba 's broken arm did n't keep him out of the world cup for long one highlight of the game for the ivory coast was the return of their star captain , didier drogba .

portugal faces north korea on monday . better late than never it took new zealand literally the entire game , but their lone goal against slovakia could n't have come at a better time .

critics fear full compensation for environmental and economic damage is unlikely . more than six weeks after the now infamous sinking of the deepwater horizon oil rig in the gulf of mexico , efforts to staunch crude oil flowing from an underwater well have only partially succeeded .
meanwhile , the environmental and financial tolls of the catastrophe have yet to be fully assessed .
tourism and fishing industries along the gulf of mexico have suffered devastating effects as oil washes ashore and vast areas of water are polluted , killing wildlife .

but the lack of mass rallies should n't be seen as a lack of public anger . when the oil tanker erika sank and broke apart off the french coast in december 1999 , the public was outraged .
an estimated crowd of 20,000 demonstrated at a rally in nantes against french oil giant total whose leased vessel had spilled approximately three million gallons of oil .
the disaster killed as many as 75,000 birds and spoiled around 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- of the coast .
three years later when the oil tanker prestige sank off the galician coast causing spain 's biggest environmental catastrophe in history , the spaniards took the the streets as well .
at least 12,000 demonstrators gathered at one rally in barcelona alone to voice their anger over the crisis management of the spanish government .
the prestige 's spill of around 20 million gallons of oil contaminated large parts of the french and spanish coasts .
the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico dwarfs both the erika and prestige disasters .
according to recent revised estimates the deepwater horizon rig has already leaked between 42 and 100 million gallons into the water with no end in sight .
that means the bp leak is causing a spill the size of the exxon valez disaster every five to 13 days .
it is by far the worst environmental disaster in us history .
few protestors at bp headquarters and yet after weeks of uninterrupted spilling , a recent rally at bp 's washington headquarters according to media reports attracted only a few dozen protesters .
a protest event in new orleans , which is directly affected by the spill , also drew only some 200 people according to media reports . " that 's not the us style , " michael e. kraft , professor of public and environmental affairs at the university of wisconsin-green bay , told deutsche welle .
" people do n't protest like that over almost anything .
but i would n't take that to mean that there is a lack of public concern . "
his colleague christoph goerg , an expert for global environmental governance at the leipzig-based helmholtz centre for environmental research , agrees : " i do n't think that the environmental consciousness in the us is generally less-developed than in europe . "
goerg believes that the absence of mass gatherings is a characteristic of the political culture in the us and the ability and the willingness of the people to articulate themselves publicly .
" what is definitely different especially compared to france , but also spain , is that in those countries there are very strong lobby groups of fishermen , but also farmers who are able not only to articulate themselves , but also to organize the people most affected by the spill and give them a public platform . " opinion polls show frustration of crisis management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of spaniards demonstrated after the prestige disaster while americans may not flock to the streets , numerous opinion surveys show that the us public is in fact deeply worried about the disaster .
seventy percent of americans , according to one poll , disapprove of bp 's handling of the crisis .
president barack obama 's crisis management has also been heavily criticized .
there are also indications of a significant shift in public opinion over offshore drilling .
in florida , one of the worst affected states , according to a new poll 51 percent of floridians now oppose new offshore drilling .
before the disaster 66 percent were in favor of drilling and only 27 against it .
but is there no way to gauge the public sentiment beyond mere surveys ?
sure , say the experts .
just log on to the internet or turn on the television .
since the explosion on the oil rig , news crews are present covering the spill around the clock .
comedians like bill maher and jon stewart have targeted bp and the obama administration repeatedly .
and in the gulf states many locals have displayed placards and posters showing their frustration over bp , but also over the government 's response .
anti-bp art on the internet on the internet new groups and websites devoted to the disaster are springing up every day .
one of the biggest ones , the boycott bp group on facebook , attracts thousands of new supporters daily and currently has more than 600,000 fans .
and at the popular blog huffington post readers can vent their anger with anti-bp art .
" the public sphere is not the street alone anymore , but also the internet with its various media outlets , " explains goerg .
" a lot of public discourse is carried out over the internet in a new kind of way that also creates new forms of publicity . "
bildunterschrift : oil companies like bp face tougher regulations and higher liability this , argues goerg , has both positive and negative aspects .
" when one attends a rally with others this is something different than when one is active on twitter or voices an opinion somewhere else on the internet , " he says .
" that is more difficult during a public rally , but on the other hand , the connection with others is stronger and one feels more like being part of a group . " the most important benchmark for the effectiveness of public sentiment over the oil spill though , argues kraft , may not be how many people attend a rally , but whether the disaster affects change .
" i think you will see some real public policy changes .
almost certainly there will be very substantial increases in environmental and safety restrictions . "
and , add the experts , one of the most important things to do is to make sure that companies like bp have a very strong financial interest in ensuring that something like this never happens again .
this process has already begun , notes kraft : " the price of bp stock has plummeted since the disaster by something like 40 percent or $ 73 billion -lrb- 60 billion euros -rrb- . so the reaction here may be a little more subtle than it is in europe . "

although recycling can help protect the environment and save resources , a closer look at the electronic scrap business reveals an extremely harmful industry .
it represents a massive health hazard for those whose job it is to sort out the old computers , cd players and printers from the west . " take a look , no problem . "
harish puts his bare hands into a big plastic container that is filled with a greenish liquid , which is bubbling at the surface .
it turns out to be nitric acid .
it burns the eyes and the nose if you hold your head too close . harish , who works on the outskirts of delhi on an industrial estate that has not been approved by the state , does know that his job could damage his health , especially his respiratory tracts .
but what else can he do , he asks .
he has no qualifications . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large amount of the world 's electronic waste goes to india for recycling dangerous process ravi aggarwal works with the ngo toxics link .
he explains how dangerous the chemical etching process is – anything that can fetch money is put in an acid bath : " it is extremely corrosive , which is the whole idea .
so when you put an epoxy board in it , then it melts away the board and leaves the copper to be stripped and to be recycled .
it can cause very strong burns , and when you throw it out , it will corrode everything around it .
but there are also fumes which come out . " the recyclers then sell on the copper from the electronic scrap that has come from all over the world – often by illegal means , says aggarwal : " all the e-waste that comes in comes in not as e-waste but under other categories or permitted ways , such as ' mixed metal scrap ' .
so we have seen containers and tracked bills of entry , which are customs documents , which contain e-waste .
our estimate is from 50,000 to 60,000 tons of electronic waste per year at least that has come in . " bildunterschrift : a worker sorts electronic equipment for recycling government ambivalent india 's coast is long and there are hardly any controls .
however , recently a scandal erupted when radioactive scrap was found on a garbage heap in the middle of delhi .
the government has promised to take action and laws are currently under debate but ravi aggarwal is skeptical . " it is very easy to stop .
you just have to put scanners at the ports and you can stop it .
but i think there is an ambivalence in government policy , because the government is saying : ok , we do n't want it , but it is good for the economy .
so , all the policy statements have been ambivalent about it .
i think this ambivalence means that they are not really serious about stopping it . " recently , government officials have started appearing at the industrial estate on the outskirts of delhi , a place where there are literally towers of garbage .
they have banned the use of acid baths and the burning of poisonous scrap . however , a man who runs a small recycling business doubts whether people will heed the government 's warnings .
he says he is not worried at all .
anyone whose business is shut down will just be able to move somewhere else .
he is sure that electronic scrap will continue to end up in india . author : kai kuestner / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 15.06.2010 eu commission slams us rating agency over greek ' junk ' status großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moody 's junk rating comes at a bad time for greece the european union 's top economic commissioner olli rehn has criticised moody 's rating agency for downgrading greece 's debt rating as the athens government struggles to solve the country 's huge national debt . the european union commissioner for economic affairs , olli rehn , has criticized the us-based rating agency moody 's for slashing its sovereign debt rating for greece to " junk " status .
speaking during a debate in the european parliament in strasbourg , rehn said that the decision to cut greece 's rating was both " surprising " and " unfortunate " at a time when eu and imf auditors were taking a hard look at the country 's attempts to slash its debt .
the eu commissioner said that the downgrade , which he had discussed with financial services commissioner michel barnier and european commission president jose manuel barroso , " again raises issues related to the role of credit rating agencies in the financial system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn says the credit rating industry needs a shake-up rehn said that the eu commission , which is seeking to regulate ratings agencies under new reforms due to be implemented in 2011 , will probe " the level of competition in the sector " and fears that a lack of transparency could represent a " conflict of interest . "
not everyone surprised but many financial experts say the downgrade by moody 's was not totally unexpected given that rival ratings agency standard and poor 's downgraded greece 's sovereign debt to junk status in april , while fitch , the other major ratings agency , warned weeks later that it , too , may follow .
" nothing has really changed since then , " said alcidi cinzia , a research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
" the agency has just put down on paper what the market has been thinking for some time , " she told deutsche welle .
questionable creditworthiness in a statement issued monday , moody 's justified its decision to lower greece 's creditworthiness rating by four notches from a3 to ba1 by pointing to considerable market uncertainty surrounding the country 's plans to reduce its huge debt and balance its finances – even with the help of the eu-imf bailout package .
moody 's describes the ba1 rating as below investment grade - or " junk " status in market parlance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister george papandreou has been facing some tough questions the downgrade means some investors will no longer be allowed to buy greek debt under the terms of their investment mandate and could lead to still higher borrowing costs for athens if it goes to the markets for cash .
observers agree that the downgrade is yet another blow to the debt-ridden country , which is under intense international scrutiny .
last month , it narrowly avoided default after the european union and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- agreed to intervene with a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- bailout .
the bailout from the eu and the imf means that greece is highly unlikely to default in the short term , if at all .
and it gives the country a few years to get its fiscal act together .
cut spending , promote growth but the bailout is a loan - not a gift - meaning that it adds to greece 's debt .
to climb out of trouble , the country will need to cut spending and , at the same time , grow its economy .
while experts agree this will be a difficult trick to pull off , the greek government has been trying hard to promote confidence in its plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks protest the government 's sweeping austerity program so , understandably , officials in athens were n't happy with moody 's call , especially its timing .
shortly after the ratings agency released its statement , the greek ministry of finance fired off it own .
" moody 's downgrade of greek government bonds today does not reflect in any way greece 's progress over the past months , " the ministry wrote .
" nor does it reflect the potential created by the country 's effort of fiscal consolidation and increased competitiveness . "
" greece is moving ahead with all the reforms stipulated in the memorandum of understanding , -lrb- and -rrb- for many of these reforms , it is already ahead of schedule . "

the information implicates as many as 4,450 people with accounts with ubs . swiss lawmakers have backed a deal with the us that would see banking giant ubs forced to hand over data on 4,450 us clients suspected of tax evasion .
the swiss and us governments , along with switzerland 's largest bank ubs , had agreed the deal in 2009 , but it needed parliamentary approval after the swiss supreme court called its legality into question .
switzerland has long faced criticism from the international community over its secretive banking laws that protect the identities of account holders with banks such as ubs .
last week it seemed the deal may have been dead in the water after parties from across the political spectrum in switzerland voted against the government-brokered agreement .
approval of the deal - by 81 votes to 61 , with 53 lawmakers abstaining - was reached after the lower house was asked to hold a second vote .
technical details remain to be ironed out and the proposal may still be put to the swiss public in a referendum before it finally becomes law .
approval of the deal could go a long way to settling lawsuits by us authorities and could save switzerland and several of its banks considerable sums of money in legal fees .

group g. and though brazil are favored , no one knows what the table will look like in the end . when ivory coast kick off against portugal on tuesday afternoon , a tournament that 's thus far been somewhat short of highlights will probably shift up a gear .
together with the selecao and north korea , those two squads comprise one of the strongest , and certainly the strangest , " group of death " in world cup history .
there are compelling storylines galore : a former colonial power up against an ersatz colony , the top soccer nation on the planet taking on the world 's most secretive country , two of the sport 's top stars bidding for elusive international success , and the top team in africa trying to measure up to the best of south america .
one thing is clear .
of brazil , portugal and ivory coast , at least one team will be making an early exit .

worries , real or feigned bildunterschrift : brazil remain the favorites all coaches of teams that are heavily favored mouth pieties about the need to respect every opponent .
but brazil 's coach carlos dunga does seem to be taking the selecao 's opening match against north korea surprisingly seriously , closing several of the team 's final practices to the public .
brazil breezed through qualifying , but this is not the same sort of team fans are used to seeing from south america 's largest nation .
dunga has emphasized tactical solidity over technical flash , leaving stars such as ronaldinho out of the squad .
the selecao still have a surfeit of talent , of course , with forward robinho and midfield general kaka both fit and capable of scoring the goals brazil need .
still , brazil 's players are sticking to the humble script .
" when we look at history , brazil may have many more titles than they do , but once the match starts we will need to have the same respect as we would have to any other team , " midfielder elano told germany 's dpa news agency ahead of the match with north korea .

" in football , the best teams do n't necessarily win , " kim told the afp news agency .
" we will give it our best .
we know we need to win to reach the knockout phase , so no matter who we 're up against , we 'll target the three points . "

his status is touch-and-go .
but even if les elephants have to do without their top scorer , the players think they ' ve gained enough discipline under new coach sven-goran eriksson to get the results that have eluded them in the past .

" that 's what we 've been working on , and we hope that it will bear fruit , starting with our first match versus portugal . "
on the other side , portugal hope their superstar , cristiano ronaldo , the 2008-09 footballer of the year , can end a 16-month scoreless streak in international competition .

the destruction of the rain forest alone is said to be responsible for around half of brazil 's greenhouse gas emissions .
the latin american country is the world 's fifth-largest polluter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of the chainsaw is increasingly part of daily life in the rainforest brazil 's president luiz inacio lula da silva reportedly wants to reduce the amount of amazon rain forest being cleared by 80 percent by 2020 .
but lula insists that the main responsibility for sustainable climate protection lies with the united nations .
following the failure of global climate talks in copenhagen last december , lula reportedly urged un secretary-general ban ki moon during a private meeting to press for a global agreement .
lula said the un is the right forum for discussions about climate change .
controversial dam project lula 's policy on protecting the environment and the rain forest became apparent in early february when brazil 's environment agency ibama approved the construction of a controversial hydro-electric dam belo monte in the middle of the amazon rain forest .
when it is completed , belo monte will be the third largest hydro-electric dam in the world , after the three gorges in china and itaipu , which is jointly run by brazil and paraguay .
it is expected to provide electricity to 23 million brazilian homes .
but residents as well as environmental activists have protested the building of the mega dam in the brazilian state of para .
the justice ministry in para has even tried to prevent the project but lula 's government has stood firm and pushed the project , estimated to cost billions .
construction is slated to begin later in 2010 - a year in which brazil holds general elections .
some 20,000 indigenous people are to be resettled and some 516 square kilometers -lrb- 199 square miles -rrb- of rain forest are to be flooded for the dam 's construction .
business interests damaging rain forest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainforest is being cleared away to make room for lucrative cattle ranching despite pledges by lula 's government to protect the rain forest and the global climate , tree-cutting and the clearing of forests to make way for pastures and cultivation of fields is continuing .
it 's no surprise considering that one of brazil 's leading exports includes beef used in burgers in fast food chains around the world .
that has made cattle ranching more profitable for farmers and encouraged them to deforest .
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations -lrb- fao -rrb- said in march that these business interests have led brazil to sacrifice an average of 26,000 square kilometers -lrb- 10,040 square miles -rrb- of forest each year in the past decade .
the rapid pace of deforestation has done irreparable damage to the so-called " air conditioner " of the world , as environmental activists call the rainforest .
the amazon acts as a " carbon sink , " absorbing carbon dioxide but once the trees are cut down , this absorption stops .
often the wood is burned , releasing carbon , and the loss of forest cover can also lead to carbon release from the soil .
the forest also releases enough water to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration to influence world climate patterns .
a ray of hope the gtz , a german state-owned organization working for sustainable development worldwide , says that the environment laws passed in brazil so far ca n't stop the destruction of the country 's tropical forests .
it estimates that around 680,000 square kilometers -lrb- 262,550 square miles -rrb- of rain forest in the amazon or 17 percent of its original area has been destroyed so far .
along the atlantic coast , just seven percent of rain forest has been preserved .
bildunterschrift : comparative satellite images highlight the extent of the damage in the brazilian state of rondonia the project " amazon region protected area " -lrb- arpa -rrb- , which is supported by germany , provides a ray of hope .
it was founded by lula 's predecessor fernando henrique cardoso who , in 1998 , vowed to designate 12 percent of the rain forest as an officially protected zone by 2012 .
that has now been postponed to 2016 and there are plans to declare the entire 600,000 square kilometers -lrb- 231,660 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest as a protected zone by then .
some progress has already been made .
so far around 390,000 square kilometers -lrb- 150,580 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest has been marked as a federally-protected zone .
but the gtz says that only half of that - just four percent of the amazon rain forest - is strictly protected . that 's too less , according to the group .
critics trace the lowest rate of deforestation in 2009 to the global financial crisis .
" the demand for beef , soya and wood has dramatically fallen , " paulo adario of greenpeace said .
but he added that slowing deforestation has little to do with efforts to protect the climate .
that means in the worst-case scenario , the brazilian rainforest faces another wave of erosion as soon as world markets begin clamoring for brazil 's exports again .

but at home , it 's struggling to juggle powerful business interests with efforts to protect its threatened rainforest . brazil is considered one of the key countries in global efforts to protect the climate .
the destruction of the rain forest alone is said to be responsible for around half of brazil 's greenhouse gas emissions .
the latin american country is the world 's fifth-largest polluter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of the chainsaw is increasingly part of daily life in the rainforest brazil 's president luiz inacio lula da silva reportedly wants to reduce the amount of amazon rain forest being cleared by 80 percent by 2020 .
but lula insists that the main responsibility for sustainable climate protection lies with the united nations .
following the failure of global climate talks in copenhagen last december , lula reportedly urged un secretary-general ban ki moon during a private meeting to press for a global agreement .
lula said the un is the right forum for discussions about climate change .
controversial dam project lula 's policy on protecting the environment and the rain forest became apparent in early february when brazil 's environment agency ibama approved the construction of a controversial hydro-electric dam belo monte in the middle of the amazon rain forest .
when it is completed , belo monte will be the third largest hydro-electric dam in the world , after the three gorges in china and itaipu , which is jointly run by brazil and paraguay .
it is expected to provide electricity to 23 million brazilian homes .
but residents as well as environmental activists have protested the building of the mega dam in the brazilian state of para .
the justice ministry in para has even tried to prevent the project but lula 's government has stood firm and pushed the project , estimated to cost billions .
construction is slated to begin later in 2010 - a year in which brazil holds general elections .
some 20,000 indigenous people are to be resettled and some 516 square kilometers -lrb- 199 square miles -rrb- of rain forest are to be flooded for the dam 's construction .
business interests damaging rain forest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainforest is being cleared away to make room for lucrative cattle ranching despite pledges by lula 's government to protect the rain forest and the global climate , tree-cutting and the clearing of forests to make way for pastures and cultivation of fields is continuing .
it 's no surprise considering that one of brazil 's leading exports includes beef used in burgers in fast food chains around the world .
that has made cattle ranching more profitable for farmers and encouraged them to deforest .
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations -lrb- fao -rrb- said in march that these business interests have led brazil to sacrifice an average of 26,000 square kilometers -lrb- 10,040 square miles -rrb- of forest each year in the past decade .
the rapid pace of deforestation has done irreparable damage to the so-called " air conditioner " of the world , as environmental activists call the rainforest .
the amazon acts as a " carbon sink , " absorbing carbon dioxide but once the trees are cut down , this absorption stops .
often the wood is burned , releasing carbon , and the loss of forest cover can also lead to carbon release from the soil .
the forest also releases enough water to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration to influence world climate patterns .
a ray of hope the gtz , a german state-owned organization working for sustainable development worldwide , says that the environment laws passed in brazil so far ca n't stop the destruction of the country 's tropical forests .
it estimates that around 680,000 square kilometers -lrb- 262,550 square miles -rrb- of rain forest in the amazon or 17 percent of its original area has been destroyed so far .
along the atlantic coast , just seven percent of rain forest has been preserved .
bildunterschrift : comparative satellite images highlight the extent of the damage in the brazilian state of rondonia the project " amazon region protected area " -lrb- arpa -rrb- , which is supported by germany , provides a ray of hope .
it was founded by lula 's predecessor fernando henrique cardoso who , in 1998 , vowed to designate 12 percent of the rain forest as an officially protected zone by 2012 .
that has now been postponed to 2016 and there are plans to declare the entire 600,000 square kilometers -lrb- 231,660 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest as a protected zone by then .

although recycling can help protect the environment and save resources , a closer look at the electronic scrap business reveals an extremely harmful industry .
it represents a massive health hazard for those whose job it is to sort out the old computers , cd players and printers from the west . " take a look , no problem . "
harish puts his bare hands into a big plastic container that is filled with a greenish liquid , which is bubbling at the surface .
it turns out to be nitric acid .
it burns the eyes and the nose if you hold your head too close . harish , who works on the outskirts of delhi on an industrial estate that has not been approved by the state , does know that his job could damage his health , especially his respiratory tracts .
but what else can he do , he asks .
he has no qualifications . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large amount of the world 's electronic waste goes to india for recycling dangerous process ravi aggarwal works with the ngo toxics link .
he explains how dangerous the chemical etching process is – anything that can fetch money is put in an acid bath : " it is extremely corrosive , which is the whole idea .
so when you put an epoxy board in it , then it melts away the board and leaves the copper to be stripped and to be recycled .
it can cause very strong burns , and when you throw it out , it will corrode everything around it .
but there are also fumes which come out .

although recycling can help protect the environment and save resources , a closer look at the electronic scrap business reveals an extremely harmful industry .
it represents a massive health hazard for those whose job it is to sort out the old computers , cd players and printers from the west . " take a look , no problem . "
harish puts his bare hands into a big plastic container that is filled with a greenish liquid , which is bubbling at the surface .
it turns out to be nitric acid .
it burns the eyes and the nose if you hold your head too close . harish , who works on the outskirts of delhi on an industrial estate that has not been approved by the state , does know that his job could damage his health , especially his respiratory tracts .

so when you put an epoxy board in it , then it melts away the board and leaves the copper to be stripped and to be recycled .
it can cause very strong burns , and when you throw it out , it will corrode everything around it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : oil spill in the gulf of mexico the oil disaster the world prefers to ignore bp oil spill must have global consequences , says former un expert obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist americans vent anger over oil spill differently from europeans environment -pipe- 15.06.2010 full oil spill compensation looks increasingly unlikely großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president obama is concluding a two day tour of affected areas in combating the gulf of mexcio oil spill , bp has resorted to controversial methods of distancing itself from negative publicity .
critics fear full compensation for environmental and economic damage is unlikely . more than six weeks after the now infamous sinking of the deepwater horizon oil rig in the gulf of mexico , efforts to staunch crude oil flowing from an underwater well have only partially succeeded .
meanwhile , the environmental and financial tolls of the catastrophe have yet to be fully assessed .
tourism and fishing industries along the gulf of mexico have suffered devastating effects as oil washes ashore and vast areas of water are polluted , killing wildlife .
bp has stopped referring to the catastrophe using the name of the " deepwater horizon " rig in favor of using the short-form name of the well it dug , " mc252 . "
it has also limited press access to affected areas , limited the release of information and bought up spill-related online search terms at major search engines .
obama foresees policy changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said the spill will shape future environment and energy policies w hile bp has already agreed to some financial compensation , skeptics doubt the full costs of the spill will ever be recovered .
currently bp is collecting about 15,000 barrels of oil a day – about half the amount believed to be leaking .
the company 's latest plan follows pressure from the obama administration and calls for more than 50,000 barrels a day to be collected by the end of june .
the well is expected to continue leaking until bp completes the first of two relief wells in august .
obama said in a recent interview the spill would alter us policy during coming years .
he has also lamented the threat posed to the gulf of mexico coastline with its wildlife-filled wetlands , beaches and waters teeming with shrimps , crabs and fish .
" in the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9/11 , i think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come , " he told the washington-based news organization politico .
fair compensation doubted a number of ngos fear that local populations and ecosystems will ultimately shoulder the catastrophe 's most significant burdens while bp minimizes losses for itself and its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers cleaning up spilled oil may later suffer health problems greenpeace spokeswoman cindy baxter said she expects a scenario similar to the aftermath of the 1989 exxon valdez spill , during which 40,000 tons of crude oil leaked into alaska 's prince william sound .
that resulted in a 19-year legal process over a five-billion-dollar compensation deal .
" exxon has taken it through the courts , and through the courts , and through the courts .
the original five billion dollars ?
that estimated amount of compensation has now been reduced to $ 500 million .
people who wanted compensation died looking for it .
that includes workers who were working on the spill and have had huge amounts of health problems from working with the dispersants that they used , " she told deutsche welle .
economic interests at risk in addition to the damage caused by the current disaster , experts say prospecting for fossil fuels will likely become riskier in the future as energy demand rises and easily accessible resources dwindle .
advocates for renewable energy sources have been quick to point this out .
felix matthes , an expert on renewable energy at the berlin institute for applied ecology , says aggressive development of renewable energy infrastructure is a necessary investment which can be unified with economic interests .
" this catastrophe in the gulf of mexico has made it clear that the current use of energy – especially as accessing raw materials becomes ever more complicated , and this access means disturbing ever more delicate ecosystems – can come at a high cost , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp may shirk fully compensating affected locals like fishermen but the global economy is still based on oil , and the oil industry enjoys political protections .
the united states ' 1990 oil pollution act , signed into law by president george bush sr. , limits liability in the case of a spill to $ 75 million .
similarly , louisiana 's senator mary landrieu has taken a stance protecting the oil industry as a whole .
david cadman of the organization local governments for sustainability said he believes bp has failed to put enough emphasis on cleanup efforts .
" the previous bush administration basically limited the liability of the oil companies in case of an accident , and i think that 's going to come home to roost .
all of a sudden we 're going to see the bills , and there 's going to be a great fight as to who should pay those bills .
and i suspect bp is going to say : ' this is the agreement we had .
we pay up to this and no more . " '

the information implicates as many as 4,450 people with accounts with ubs . swiss lawmakers have backed a deal with the us that would see banking giant ubs forced to hand over data on 4,450 us clients suspected of tax evasion .
the swiss and us governments , along with switzerland 's largest bank ubs , had agreed the deal in 2009 , but it needed parliamentary approval after the swiss supreme court called its legality into question .
switzerland has long faced criticism from the international community over its secretive banking laws that protect the identities of account holders with banks such as ubs .
last week it seemed the deal may have been dead in the water after parties from across the political spectrum in switzerland voted against the government-brokered agreement .
approval of the deal - by 81 votes to 61 , with 53 lawmakers abstaining - was reached after the lower house was asked to hold a second vote .
technical details remain to be ironed out and the proposal may still be put to the swiss public in a referendum before it finally becomes law .
approval of the deal could go a long way to settling lawsuits by us authorities and could save switzerland and several of its banks considerable sums of money in legal fees .

group g. and though brazil are favored , no one knows what the table will look like in the end . when ivory coast kick off against portugal on tuesday afternoon , a tournament that 's thus far been somewhat short of highlights will probably shift up a gear .
together with the selecao and north korea , those two squads comprise one of the strongest , and certainly the strangest , " group of death " in world cup history .
there are compelling storylines galore : a former colonial power up against an ersatz colony , the top soccer nation on the planet taking on the world 's most secretive country , two of the sport 's top stars bidding for elusive international success , and the top team in africa trying to measure up to the best of south america .
one thing is clear .
of brazil , portugal and ivory coast , at least one team will be making an early exit .
and which team that is could come down to an intriguing joker thrown into the deck , north korea .
worries , real or feigned bildunterschrift : brazil remain the favorites all coaches of teams that are heavily favored mouth pieties about the need to respect every opponent .
but brazil 's coach carlos dunga does seem to be taking the selecao 's opening match against north korea surprisingly seriously , closing several of the team 's final practices to the public .
brazil breezed through qualifying , but this is not the same sort of team fans are used to seeing from south america 's largest nation .
dunga has emphasized tactical solidity over technical flash , leaving stars such as ronaldinho out of the squad .
the selecao still have a surfeit of talent , of course , with forward robinho and midfield general kaka both fit and capable of scoring the goals brazil need .
still , brazil 's players are sticking to the humble script .
" when we look at history , brazil may have many more titles than they do , but once the match starts we will need to have the same respect as we would have to any other team , " midfielder elano told germany 's dpa news agency ahead of the match with north korea .
and legendary former brazil player socrates told the bbc before the start of tournament that they were fielding a too-workmanlike squad of players with questionable fitness , and predicted the selecao would have difficulties in the group stage .
astonishingly , it 's been the underdogs doing most of the big talking .
the asian wayne rooney bildunterschrift : the man on the right is considered the asian wayne north korea have only taken part in one previous world cup , and that was back in 1966 - although they did score a shocking upset of italy in the group stage .
but their coach kim jong-hun says the outsiders do indeed have a chance in the toughest of all groups .
" in football , the best teams do n't necessarily win , " kim told the afp news agency .
" we will give it our best .
we know we need to win to reach the knockout phase , so no matter who we 're up against , we 'll target the three points . "
almost the entire squad plays its football in the domestic north korean league .
but striker jong tae-se plies his trade in japan , where he has become known as the " asian wayne rooney . "
" the match will be very difficult , but we can beat brazil , " jong told dpa .
" our team has a mentality similar to the german one , which is the best in the world . "
anticipation is making him wait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drogba is working hard on his comeback ahead of the ivory coast-portugal clash , much of the attention has focussed on two superstars .
ivory coast are hoping that striker didier drogba can recover from a fractured elbow picked up in a pre-tournament friendly .
his status is touch-and-go .
but even if les elephants have to do without their top scorer , the players think they ' ve gained enough discipline under new coach sven-goran eriksson to get the results that have eluded them in the past .
" we 've always had good players but have never been able to properly work together as an effective unit , defending and attacking as one , " ivory coast defender kolo toure told dpa .
" that 's what we 've been working on , and we hope that it will bear fruit , starting with our first match versus portugal . "
on the other side , portugal hope their superstar , cristiano ronaldo , the 2008-09 footballer of the year , can end a 16-month scoreless streak in international competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo is keeping his head up but cr7 would n't be cr7 , if he lacked confidence .
" it 's like a great player once told me , goals are like ketchup , " ronaldo told dpa .
" you keep on forcing it , then it comes all at once . "
portugese fans better hope the ketchup starts flowing because scoring goals - lots of them - may be the key to surviving this group .
the tie-breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group could be a lottery in the end in a group this tight , it 's entirely possible that two teams might end up level on points in second place in the final table .
according to the rules laid out by football 's world governing body fifa , goal difference is to be used to break any ties .
and that would make an 8-nil thrashing of north korea , for instance , of enormous value .
even stranger would be the scenario if three teams ended up level on points .
the goal-difference rule applies there as well , but there has considerable confusion about precisely how it , and other rules , would be applied in this unlikely but possible scenario .
if else fails , the decision will be made by flipping a coin .
that is extremely , extremely unlikely , but anything could happen in a group of death with more than its fair share of oddities .

the information implicates as many as 4,450 people with accounts with ubs . swiss lawmakers have backed a deal with the us that would see banking giant ubs forced to hand over data on 4,450 us clients suspected of tax evasion .
the swiss and us governments , along with switzerland 's largest bank ubs , had agreed the deal in 2009 , but it needed parliamentary approval after the swiss supreme court called its legality into question .
switzerland has long faced criticism from the international community over its secretive banking laws that protect the identities of account holders with banks such as ubs .
last week it seemed the deal may have been dead in the water after parties from across the political spectrum in switzerland voted against the government-brokered agreement .
approval of the deal - by 81 votes to 61 , with 53 lawmakers abstaining - was reached after the lower house was asked to hold a second vote .
technical details remain to be ironed out and the proposal may still be put to the swiss public in a referendum before it finally becomes law .
approval of the deal could go a long way to settling lawsuits by us authorities and could save switzerland and several of its banks considerable sums of money in legal fees .

the south should last longer while nobody will admit to arriving at the world cup just to make up the numbers , the realists among the 32 nations competing will know that it 's highly unlikely that they 'll get out of the group stages . no-one can say what will happen at a world cup .
previous form means little in the heat of battle at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
good teams can have bad days and bad teams can have good ones .
but there are certain teams who arrive with barely a shred of hope of getting out of the group stage .
they may make things difficult for their group opponents and maybe pull off a shock on their way out of the competition , but these are the teams who arrive with no expectations and who are just happy to be there .
there are a number of teams who may struggle in the group stages but here , deutsche welle takes a look at three teams who may already have their return tickets booked for june 26th when the knock-out stage begins .
north korea the team from the one of the world 's most secretive and repressive states is apparently resorting to type in south africa by keeping its preparations and players under cover .
journalists are given short shrift , while training sessions - which every other team has opened to the public - are held behind closed doors .
perhaps north korea are just afraid at showing their group c rivals just how bad they are .
saying that , they are at the world cup for the first time since they famously reached the quarter-finals of the 1966 finals so they ca n't be that bad – can they ?
bildunterschrift : let 's hope that the north korean team are as well-drilled and co-ordinated as their supporters qualifying from the asia conference after beating the likes of saudi arabia , jordan and united arab emirates , and holding their own with their more experienced southern neighbors , north korea – known as the chollima , a mythical horse too swift to be mounted – start with a clean slate , just like everyone else at the 2010 world cup .
but after failing to make the finals at any point in the last 44 years and finding themselves in the " group of death " with brazil , portugal and the ivory coast , it does n't matter how good or bad they are , the smart money is on north korea heading home after three games .
the team , ranked 105th in the world , is made up predominantly of players who feature in north korean teams with only a handful playing outside of the ironhanded communist state .
jong tae-se , known as asia 's wayne rooney , and an yong-hak play in japan 's j-league while striker hong yong-jo plays for russia 's fc rostov .
such is the nature of the country 's regime , very little is known about the rest of the team .
new zealand coming from one of the most laid-back countries on earth , the all whites arrive in south africa under no illusions .
faced with a group featuring world champions italy , paraguay and slovakia , the new zealand team accepts that their world cup is likely to end at the group stage .
this will not stop them from giving their all and enjoying the experience to the fullest .
bildunterschrift : the all whites - here in all black - may not be world beaters but they might make it harder for others however , instead of arriving expecting to get thrashed , the all whites are quietly confident that they can at least give their group f opponents a few headaches after a 1-0 friendly victory over serbia and feisty defeats to chile , to whom they lost 2-0 , and a close 2-1 loss to oceania rivals australia .
while they might not be heading for knock-out stage qualification themselves , their involvement in the tournament may at least dictate who out of their group opponents ' progress .
the minnows from the cinematic middle earth have only featured in one other word cup , in spain in 1982 , when they lost all three matches .
much like what is expected from this tournament , the all whites gave a good account of themselves in a difficult group featuring brazil , the soviet union and scotland .
honduras if facing one of the world cup favorites , a plucky european battler , and one of the best teams in south america -lrb- on current form -rrb- is n't bad enough , honduras arrive in south africa without a win to their name since january 's 2-1 victory over the united states .
they recently struggled in a goalless draw with azerbaijan , labored to a 2-2 draw against belarus and also got beaten 3-0 by non-qualifier romania in their final friendly before heading to the world cup .
getting the type of results to beat spain , switzerland and chile to qualify from group h may be a tall order for honduras on current form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavon and co. are already being written off back home there is quality in the side , which features tottenham hotspur midfielder wilson palacios , as well as an experienced strike force made up of david suazo , who plays for genoa in italy 's serie a , and the ageless carlos pavon .
the 36-year-old pavon is closing in on the two-decade mark in a career which has taken him to 15 clubs and counting , in countries as disparate as italy , spain , colombia , and the united states but the team 's confidence wo n't be helped by news from home that the majority of supporters are horrified by their pre-world cup form .
pressure is building on colombian-born coach reinaldo rueda who is accused by many pundits back in honduras of having no idea as to how he wants the team to play .
with spain looking more dangerous than ever , the swiss capable of either genius or farce under ottmar hitzfeld , and high-scoring chile obsessed with fast-tempo attacking play , the best honduras can hope for is a result against switzerland and damage control against the spaniards and chileans before flying home to face their rabid press .

the information implicates as many as 4,450 people with accounts with ubs . swiss lawmakers have backed a deal with the us that would see banking giant ubs forced to hand over data on 4,450 us clients suspected of tax evasion .
the swiss and us governments , along with switzerland 's largest bank ubs , had agreed the deal in 2009 , but it needed parliamentary approval after the swiss supreme court called its legality into question .
switzerland has long faced criticism from the international community over its secretive banking laws that protect the identities of account holders with banks such as ubs .
last week it seemed the deal may have been dead in the water after parties from across the political spectrum in switzerland voted against the government-brokered agreement .
approval of the deal - by 81 votes to 61 , with 53 lawmakers abstaining - was reached after the lower house was asked to hold a second vote .
technical details remain to be ironed out and the proposal may still be put to the swiss public in a referendum before it finally becomes law .
approval of the deal could go a long way to settling lawsuits by us authorities and could save switzerland and several of its banks considerable sums of money in legal fees .

the south should last longer while nobody will admit to arriving at the world cup just to make up the numbers , the realists among the 32 nations competing will know that it 's highly unlikely that they 'll get out of the group stages . no-one can say what will happen at a world cup .
previous form means little in the heat of battle at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
good teams can have bad days and bad teams can have good ones .
but there are certain teams who arrive with barely a shred of hope of getting out of the group stage .
they may make things difficult for their group opponents and maybe pull off a shock on their way out of the competition , but these are the teams who arrive with no expectations and who are just happy to be there .
there are a number of teams who may struggle in the group stages but here , deutsche welle takes a look at three teams who may already have their return tickets booked for june 26th when the knock-out stage begins .
north korea the team from the one of the world 's most secretive and repressive states is apparently resorting to type in south africa by keeping its preparations and players under cover .
journalists are given short shrift , while training sessions - which every other team has opened to the public - are held behind closed doors .
perhaps north korea are just afraid at showing their group c rivals just how bad they are .
saying that , they are at the world cup for the first time since they famously reached the quarter-finals of the 1966 finals so they ca n't be that bad – can they ?
bildunterschrift : let 's hope that the north korean team are as well-drilled and co-ordinated as their supporters qualifying from the asia conference after beating the likes of saudi arabia , jordan and united arab emirates , and holding their own with their more experienced southern neighbors , north korea – known as the chollima , a mythical horse too swift to be mounted – start with a clean slate , just like everyone else at the 2010 world cup .
but after failing to make the finals at any point in the last 44 years and finding themselves in the " group of death " with brazil , portugal and the ivory coast , it does n't matter how good or bad they are , the smart money is on north korea heading home after three games .
the team , ranked 105th in the world , is made up predominantly of players who feature in north korean teams with only a handful playing outside of the ironhanded communist state .
jong tae-se , known as asia 's wayne rooney , and an yong-hak play in japan 's j-league while striker hong yong-jo plays for russia 's fc rostov .
such is the nature of the country 's regime , very little is known about the rest of the team .
new zealand coming from one of the most laid-back countries on earth , the all whites arrive in south africa under no illusions .
faced with a group featuring world champions italy , paraguay and slovakia , the new zealand team accepts that their world cup is likely to end at the group stage .
this will not stop them from giving their all and enjoying the experience to the fullest .
bildunterschrift : the all whites - here in all black - may not be world beaters but they might make it harder for others however , instead of arriving expecting to get thrashed , the all whites are quietly confident that they can at least give their group f opponents a few headaches after a 1-0 friendly victory over serbia and feisty defeats to chile , to whom they lost 2-0 , and a close 2-1 loss to oceania rivals australia .
while they might not be heading for knock-out stage qualification themselves , their involvement in the tournament may at least dictate who out of their group opponents ' progress .
the minnows from the cinematic middle earth have only featured in one other word cup , in spain in 1982 , when they lost all three matches .
much like what is expected from this tournament , the all whites gave a good account of themselves in a difficult group featuring brazil , the soviet union and scotland .
honduras if facing one of the world cup favorites , a plucky european battler , and one of the best teams in south america -lrb- on current form -rrb- is n't bad enough , honduras arrive in south africa without a win to their name since january 's 2-1 victory over the united states .
they recently struggled in a goalless draw with azerbaijan , labored to a 2-2 draw against belarus and also got beaten 3-0 by non-qualifier romania in their final friendly before heading to the world cup .
getting the type of results to beat spain , switzerland and chile to qualify from group h may be a tall order for honduras on current form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavon and co. are already being written off back home there is quality in the side , which features tottenham hotspur midfielder wilson palacios , as well as an experienced strike force made up of david suazo , who plays for genoa in italy 's serie a , and the ageless carlos pavon .
the 36-year-old pavon is closing in on the two-decade mark in a career which has taken him to 15 clubs and counting , in countries as disparate as italy , spain , colombia , and the united states but the team 's confidence wo n't be helped by news from home that the majority of supporters are horrified by their pre-world cup form .
pressure is building on colombian-born coach reinaldo rueda who is accused by many pundits back in honduras of having no idea as to how he wants the team to play .
with spain looking more dangerous than ever , the swiss capable of either genius or farce under ottmar hitzfeld , and high-scoring chile obsessed with fast-tempo attacking play , the best honduras can hope for is a result against switzerland and damage control against the spaniards and chileans before flying home to face their rabid press .

critics fear full compensation for environmental and economic damage is unlikely . more than six weeks after the now infamous sinking of the deepwater horizon oil rig in the gulf of mexico , efforts to staunch crude oil flowing from an underwater well have only partially succeeded .
meanwhile , the environmental and financial tolls of the catastrophe have yet to be fully assessed .
tourism and fishing industries along the gulf of mexico have suffered devastating effects as oil washes ashore and vast areas of water are polluted , killing wildlife .
bp has stopped referring to the catastrophe using the name of the " deepwater horizon " rig in favor of using the short-form name of the well it dug , " mc252 . "
it has also limited press access to affected areas , limited the release of information and bought up spill-related online search terms at major search engines .
obama foresees policy changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said the spill will shape future environment and energy policies w hile bp has already agreed to some financial compensation , skeptics doubt the full costs of the spill will ever be recovered .
currently bp is collecting about 15,000 barrels of oil a day – about half the amount believed to be leaking .
the company 's latest plan follows pressure from the obama administration and calls for more than 50,000 barrels a day to be collected by the end of june .
the well is expected to continue leaking until bp completes the first of two relief wells in august .
obama said in a recent interview the spill would alter us policy during coming years .
he has also lamented the threat posed to the gulf of mexico coastline with its wildlife-filled wetlands , beaches and waters teeming with shrimps , crabs and fish .
" in the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9/11 , i think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come , " he told the washington-based news organization politico .
fair compensation doubted a number of ngos fear that local populations and ecosystems will ultimately shoulder the catastrophe 's most significant burdens while bp minimizes losses for itself and its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers cleaning up spilled oil may later suffer health problems greenpeace spokeswoman cindy baxter said she expects a scenario similar to the aftermath of the 1989 exxon valdez spill , during which 40,000 tons of crude oil leaked into alaska 's prince william sound .
that resulted in a 19-year legal process over a five-billion-dollar compensation deal .
" exxon has taken it through the courts , and through the courts , and through the courts .
the original five billion dollars ?
that estimated amount of compensation has now been reduced to $ 500 million .
people who wanted compensation died looking for it .
that includes workers who were working on the spill and have had huge amounts of health problems from working with the dispersants that they used , " she told deutsche welle .
economic interests at risk in addition to the damage caused by the current disaster , experts say prospecting for fossil fuels will likely become riskier in the future as energy demand rises and easily accessible resources dwindle .
advocates for renewable energy sources have been quick to point this out .
felix matthes , an expert on renewable energy at the berlin institute for applied ecology , says aggressive development of renewable energy infrastructure is a necessary investment which can be unified with economic interests .
" this catastrophe in the gulf of mexico has made it clear that the current use of energy – especially as accessing raw materials becomes ever more complicated , and this access means disturbing ever more delicate ecosystems – can come at a high cost , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp may shirk fully compensating affected locals like fishermen but the global economy is still based on oil , and the oil industry enjoys political protections .

critics fear full compensation for environmental and economic damage is unlikely . more than six weeks after the now infamous sinking of the deepwater horizon oil rig in the gulf of mexico , efforts to staunch crude oil flowing from an underwater well have only partially succeeded .
meanwhile , the environmental and financial tolls of the catastrophe have yet to be fully assessed .
tourism and fishing industries along the gulf of mexico have suffered devastating effects as oil washes ashore and vast areas of water are polluted , killing wildlife .
bp has stopped referring to the catastrophe using the name of the " deepwater horizon " rig in favor of using the short-form name of the well it dug , " mc252 . "
it has also limited press access to affected areas , limited the release of information and bought up spill-related online search terms at major search engines .
obama foresees policy changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said the spill will shape future environment and energy policies w hile bp has already agreed to some financial compensation , skeptics doubt the full costs of the spill will ever be recovered .
currently bp is collecting about 15,000 barrels of oil a day – about half the amount believed to be leaking .
the company 's latest plan follows pressure from the obama administration and calls for more than 50,000 barrels a day to be collected by the end of june .
the well is expected to continue leaking until bp completes the first of two relief wells in august .
obama said in a recent interview the spill would alter us policy during coming years .
he has also lamented the threat posed to the gulf of mexico coastline with its wildlife-filled wetlands , beaches and waters teeming with shrimps , crabs and fish .
" in the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9/11 , i think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come , " he told the washington-based news organization politico .
fair compensation doubted a number of ngos fear that local populations and ecosystems will ultimately shoulder the catastrophe 's most significant burdens while bp minimizes losses for itself and its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers cleaning up spilled oil may later suffer health problems greenpeace spokeswoman cindy baxter said she expects a scenario similar to the aftermath of the 1989 exxon valdez spill , during which 40,000 tons of crude oil leaked into alaska 's prince william sound .
that resulted in a 19-year legal process over a five-billion-dollar compensation deal .
" exxon has taken it through the courts , and through the courts , and through the courts .
the original five billion dollars ?
that estimated amount of compensation has now been reduced to $ 500 million .
people who wanted compensation died looking for it .
that includes workers who were working on the spill and have had huge amounts of health problems from working with the dispersants that they used , " she told deutsche welle .
economic interests at risk in addition to the damage caused by the current disaster , experts say prospecting for fossil fuels will likely become riskier in the future as energy demand rises and easily accessible resources dwindle .
advocates for renewable energy sources have been quick to point this out .
felix matthes , an expert on renewable energy at the berlin institute for applied ecology , says aggressive development of renewable energy infrastructure is a necessary investment which can be unified with economic interests .
" this catastrophe in the gulf of mexico has made it clear that the current use of energy – especially as accessing raw materials becomes ever more complicated , and this access means disturbing ever more delicate ecosystems – can come at a high cost , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp may shirk fully compensating affected locals like fishermen but the global economy is still based on oil , and the oil industry enjoys political protections .
the united states ' 1990 oil pollution act , signed into law by president george bush sr. , limits liability in the case of a spill to $ 75 million .
similarly , louisiana 's senator mary landrieu has taken a stance protecting the oil industry as a whole .
david cadman of the organization local governments for sustainability said he believes bp has failed to put enough emphasis on cleanup efforts .
" the previous bush administration basically limited the liability of the oil companies in case of an accident , and i think that 's going to come home to roost .
all of a sudden we 're going to see the bills , and there 's going to be a great fight as to who should pay those bills .
and i suspect bp is going to say : ' this is the agreement we had .

'
group mates ivory coast and portugal finished scoreless , while a late new zealand goal saved a point against slovakia . in the world cup debut of the so-called ' group of death ' - formally known as group g - brazil emerged on top after its 2-1 win over north korea . perennial world cup favorites brazil dominated possession in the first half but a resolute north korean defense kept coach carlos dunga 's squad from finding the back of the net . brazil kept up the pressure in the second half , continuing to probe north korea 's defense but being turned away every time . that changed in the 55th minute .
brazilian midfielder elano played a through-ball to defender maicon , who fired a nearly sideways shot from less than a meter from the end line .
the ball slipped between north korean keeper ri myong guk and the near post before curving over the line and into the goal . bildunterschrift : north korea was on defense for most of the game the brazilians added a second goal in the 72nd minute .
this time it was elano who took the easy shot following a precision cross from robinho . if history is any guide , it was only a matter of time before one of brazil 's attacks made it through : the brazilians have scored at least one goal in every group stage match of the world cup since 1978 , when they drew 0-0 against spain . north korea pulled one back near the end of the game as forward jong tae se laid down a header in front of defender ji yun nam , who booted the ball over brazilian keeper julio cesar to score in the 89th minute . drogba back in action despite playing a hard-fought match on both sides , neither team in the other group g match between the ivory coast and portugal had a particularly high number of scoring opportunities , and the ones that did come along never resulted in a goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drogba 's broken arm did n't keep him out of the world cup for long one highlight of the game for the ivory coast was the return of their star captain , didier drogba .

portugal faces north korea on monday . better late than never it took new zealand literally the entire game , but their lone goal against slovakia could n't have come at a better time .

'
group mates ivory coast and portugal finished scoreless , while a late new zealand goal saved a point against slovakia . in the world cup debut of the so-called ' group of death ' - formally known as group g - brazil emerged on top after its 2-1 win over north korea . perennial world cup favorites brazil dominated possession in the first half but a resolute north korean defense kept coach carlos dunga 's squad from finding the back of the net . brazil kept up the pressure in the second half , continuing to probe north korea 's defense but being turned away every time . that changed in the 55th minute .
brazilian midfielder elano played a through-ball to defender maicon , who fired a nearly sideways shot from less than a meter from the end line .
the ball slipped between north korean keeper ri myong guk and the near post before curving over the line and into the goal . bildunterschrift : north korea was on defense for most of the game the brazilians added a second goal in the 72nd minute .
this time it was elano who took the easy shot following a precision cross from robinho . if history is any guide , it was only a matter of time before one of brazil 's attacks made it through : the brazilians have scored at least one goal in every group stage match of the world cup since 1978 , when they drew 0-0 against spain . north korea pulled one back near the end of the game as forward jong tae se laid down a header in front of defender ji yun nam , who booted the ball over brazilian keeper julio cesar to score in the 89th minute . drogba back in action despite playing a hard-fought match on both sides , neither team in the other group g match between the ivory coast and portugal had a particularly high number of scoring opportunities , and the ones that did come along never resulted in a goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drogba 's broken arm did n't keep him out of the world cup for long one highlight of the game for the ivory coast was the return of their star captain , didier drogba .
the forward broke his arm in a warm-up match against japan 11 days ago , and his status for the group g opener against portugal was questionable . although drogba did n't start , he was subbed in the 66th minute for salomon kalou , a teammate of drogba 's at fc chelsea . the ivory coast 's next match is a big one in the group as they face brazil .
portugal faces north korea on monday . better late than never it took new zealand literally the entire game , but their lone goal against slovakia could n't have come at a better time .
slovakia looked to be on their way to a 1-0 win as the referee indicated three minutes of injury time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reid -lrb- left -rrb- celebrates his last-second goal for new zealand but new zealand put together a hectic offensive sequence after two and a half minutes of injury time and managed to tie the game , salvaging a point in group f with the 1-1 draw . with the final whistle seconds away , new zealand forward shane smeltz delivered a cross to defender winston reid , who connected for a header . slovakia 's goal was nearly identical but came in the 50th minute .
after slowly building up an attack , slovakian forward stanislav sestak launched a curling cross that was right on target for robert vittek to score on a header . the group 's other teams , italy and paraguay , also played to a 1-1 tie on monday night , meaning group f is all square with one point per team . author : matt zuvela editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : oil spill in the gulf of mexico the oil disaster the world prefers to ignore bp oil spill must have global consequences , says former un expert obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist full oil spill compensation looks increasingly unlikely disasters -pipe- 15.06.2010 americans vent anger over oil spill differently from europeans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a lack of mass protests by fishermen in the gulf states compared to earlier oil disasters in europe where thousands took to the streets , the outcry in the us over the bp spill seems rather restrained .
but the lack of mass rallies should n't be seen as a lack of public anger . when the oil tanker erika sank and broke apart off the french coast in december 1999 , the public was outraged .
an estimated crowd of 20,000 demonstrated at a rally in nantes against french oil giant total whose leased vessel had spilled approximately three million gallons of oil .
the disaster killed as many as 75,000 birds and spoiled around 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- of the coast .
three years later when the oil tanker prestige sank off the galician coast causing spain 's biggest environmental catastrophe in history , the spaniards took the the streets as well .
at least 12,000 demonstrators gathered at one rally in barcelona alone to voice their anger over the crisis management of the spanish government .
the prestige 's spill of around 20 million gallons of oil contaminated large parts of the french and spanish coasts .
the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico dwarfs both the erika and prestige disasters .
according to recent revised estimates the deepwater horizon rig has already leaked between 42 and 100 million gallons into the water with no end in sight .
that means the bp leak is causing a spill the size of the exxon valez disaster every five to 13 days .
it is by far the worst environmental disaster in us history .
few protestors at bp headquarters and yet after weeks of uninterrupted spilling , a recent rally at bp 's washington headquarters according to media reports attracted only a few dozen protesters .
a protest event in new orleans , which is directly affected by the spill , also drew only some 200 people according to media reports . " that 's not the us style , " michael e. kraft , professor of public and environmental affairs at the university of wisconsin-green bay , told deutsche welle .
" people do n't protest like that over almost anything .
but i would n't take that to mean that there is a lack of public concern . "
his colleague christoph goerg , an expert for global environmental governance at the leipzig-based helmholtz centre for environmental research , agrees : " i do n't think that the environmental consciousness in the us is generally less-developed than in europe . "
goerg believes that the absence of mass gatherings is a characteristic of the political culture in the us and the ability and the willingness of the people to articulate themselves publicly .
" what is definitely different especially compared to france , but also spain , is that in those countries there are very strong lobby groups of fishermen , but also farmers who are able not only to articulate themselves , but also to organize the people most affected by the spill and give them a public platform . " opinion polls show frustration of crisis management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of spaniards demonstrated after the prestige disaster while americans may not flock to the streets , numerous opinion surveys show that the us public is in fact deeply worried about the disaster .
seventy percent of americans , according to one poll , disapprove of bp 's handling of the crisis .
president barack obama 's crisis management has also been heavily criticized .
there are also indications of a significant shift in public opinion over offshore drilling .
in florida , one of the worst affected states , according to a new poll 51 percent of floridians now oppose new offshore drilling .
before the disaster 66 percent were in favor of drilling and only 27 against it .
but is there no way to gauge the public sentiment beyond mere surveys ?
sure , say the experts .
just log on to the internet or turn on the television .
since the explosion on the oil rig , news crews are present covering the spill around the clock .
comedians like bill maher and jon stewart have targeted bp and the obama administration repeatedly .
and in the gulf states many locals have displayed placards and posters showing their frustration over bp , but also over the government 's response .
anti-bp art on the internet on the internet new groups and websites devoted to the disaster are springing up every day .
one of the biggest ones , the boycott bp group on facebook , attracts thousands of new supporters daily and currently has more than 600,000 fans .
and at the popular blog huffington post readers can vent their anger with anti-bp art .
" the public sphere is not the street alone anymore , but also the internet with its various media outlets , " explains goerg .
" a lot of public discourse is carried out over the internet in a new kind of way that also creates new forms of publicity . "
bildunterschrift : oil companies like bp face tougher regulations and higher liability this , argues goerg , has both positive and negative aspects .
" when one attends a rally with others this is something different than when one is active on twitter or voices an opinion somewhere else on the internet , " he says .
" that is more difficult during a public rally , but on the other hand , the connection with others is stronger and one feels more like being part of a group . " the most important benchmark for the effectiveness of public sentiment over the oil spill though , argues kraft , may not be how many people attend a rally , but whether the disaster affects change .
" i think you will see some real public policy changes .
almost certainly there will be very substantial increases in environmental and safety restrictions . "
and , add the experts , one of the most important things to do is to make sure that companies like bp have a very strong financial interest in ensuring that something like this never happens again .
this process has already begun , notes kraft : " the price of bp stock has plummeted since the disaster by something like 40 percent or $ 73 billion -lrb- 60 billion euros -rrb- . so the reaction here may be a little more subtle than it is in europe . "

but the lack of mass rallies should n't be seen as a lack of public anger . when the oil tanker erika sank and broke apart off the french coast in december 1999 , the public was outraged .
an estimated crowd of 20,000 demonstrated at a rally in nantes against french oil giant total whose leased vessel had spilled approximately three million gallons of oil .
the disaster killed as many as 75,000 birds and spoiled around 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- of the coast .
three years later when the oil tanker prestige sank off the galician coast causing spain 's biggest environmental catastrophe in history , the spaniards took the the streets as well .
at least 12,000 demonstrators gathered at one rally in barcelona alone to voice their anger over the crisis management of the spanish government .
the prestige 's spill of around 20 million gallons of oil contaminated large parts of the french and spanish coasts .
the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico dwarfs both the erika and prestige disasters .
according to recent revised estimates the deepwater horizon rig has already leaked between 42 and 100 million gallons into the water with no end in sight .
that means the bp leak is causing a spill the size of the exxon valez disaster every five to 13 days .
it is by far the worst environmental disaster in us history .
few protestors at bp headquarters and yet after weeks of uninterrupted spilling , a recent rally at bp 's washington headquarters according to media reports attracted only a few dozen protesters .
a protest event in new orleans , which is directly affected by the spill , also drew only some 200 people according to media reports . " that 's not the us style , " michael e. kraft , professor of public and environmental affairs at the university of wisconsin-green bay , told deutsche welle .
" people do n't protest like that over almost anything .
but i would n't take that to mean that there is a lack of public concern . "
his colleague christoph goerg , an expert for global environmental governance at the leipzig-based helmholtz centre for environmental research , agrees : " i do n't think that the environmental consciousness in the us is generally less-developed than in europe . "
goerg believes that the absence of mass gatherings is a characteristic of the political culture in the us and the ability and the willingness of the people to articulate themselves publicly .
" what is definitely different especially compared to france , but also spain , is that in those countries there are very strong lobby groups of fishermen , but also farmers who are able not only to articulate themselves , but also to organize the people most affected by the spill and give them a public platform . " opinion polls show frustration of crisis management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of spaniards demonstrated after the prestige disaster while americans may not flock to the streets , numerous opinion surveys show that the us public is in fact deeply worried about the disaster .
seventy percent of americans , according to one poll , disapprove of bp 's handling of the crisis .
president barack obama 's crisis management has also been heavily criticized .
there are also indications of a significant shift in public opinion over offshore drilling .
in florida , one of the worst affected states , according to a new poll 51 percent of floridians now oppose new offshore drilling .
before the disaster 66 percent were in favor of drilling and only 27 against it .
but is there no way to gauge the public sentiment beyond mere surveys ?
sure , say the experts .
just log on to the internet or turn on the television .
since the explosion on the oil rig , news crews are present covering the spill around the clock .
comedians like bill maher and jon stewart have targeted bp and the obama administration repeatedly .
and in the gulf states many locals have displayed placards and posters showing their frustration over bp , but also over the government 's response .
anti-bp art on the internet on the internet new groups and websites devoted to the disaster are springing up every day .
one of the biggest ones , the boycott bp group on facebook , attracts thousands of new supporters daily and currently has more than 600,000 fans .
and at the popular blog huffington post readers can vent their anger with anti-bp art .
" the public sphere is not the street alone anymore , but also the internet with its various media outlets , " explains goerg .

but at home , it 's struggling to juggle powerful business interests with efforts to protect its threatened rainforest . brazil is considered one of the key countries in global efforts to protect the climate .
the destruction of the rain forest alone is said to be responsible for around half of brazil 's greenhouse gas emissions .
the latin american country is the world 's fifth-largest polluter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of the chainsaw is increasingly part of daily life in the rainforest brazil 's president luiz inacio lula da silva reportedly wants to reduce the amount of amazon rain forest being cleared by 80 percent by 2020 .
but lula insists that the main responsibility for sustainable climate protection lies with the united nations .
following the failure of global climate talks in copenhagen last december , lula reportedly urged un secretary-general ban ki moon during a private meeting to press for a global agreement .
lula said the un is the right forum for discussions about climate change .
controversial dam project lula 's policy on protecting the environment and the rain forest became apparent in early february when brazil 's environment agency ibama approved the construction of a controversial hydro-electric dam belo monte in the middle of the amazon rain forest .
when it is completed , belo monte will be the third largest hydro-electric dam in the world , after the three gorges in china and itaipu , which is jointly run by brazil and paraguay .
it is expected to provide electricity to 23 million brazilian homes .
but residents as well as environmental activists have protested the building of the mega dam in the brazilian state of para .
the justice ministry in para has even tried to prevent the project but lula 's government has stood firm and pushed the project , estimated to cost billions .
construction is slated to begin later in 2010 - a year in which brazil holds general elections .
some 20,000 indigenous people are to be resettled and some 516 square kilometers -lrb- 199 square miles -rrb- of rain forest are to be flooded for the dam 's construction .
business interests damaging rain forest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainforest is being cleared away to make room for lucrative cattle ranching despite pledges by lula 's government to protect the rain forest and the global climate , tree-cutting and the clearing of forests to make way for pastures and cultivation of fields is continuing .
it 's no surprise considering that one of brazil 's leading exports includes beef used in burgers in fast food chains around the world .
that has made cattle ranching more profitable for farmers and encouraged them to deforest .
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations -lrb- fao -rrb- said in march that these business interests have led brazil to sacrifice an average of 26,000 square kilometers -lrb- 10,040 square miles -rrb- of forest each year in the past decade .
the rapid pace of deforestation has done irreparable damage to the so-called " air conditioner " of the world , as environmental activists call the rainforest .
the amazon acts as a " carbon sink , " absorbing carbon dioxide but once the trees are cut down , this absorption stops .
often the wood is burned , releasing carbon , and the loss of forest cover can also lead to carbon release from the soil .
the forest also releases enough water to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration to influence world climate patterns .
a ray of hope the gtz , a german state-owned organization working for sustainable development worldwide , says that the environment laws passed in brazil so far ca n't stop the destruction of the country 's tropical forests .
it estimates that around 680,000 square kilometers -lrb- 262,550 square miles -rrb- of rain forest in the amazon or 17 percent of its original area has been destroyed so far .
along the atlantic coast , just seven percent of rain forest has been preserved .
bildunterschrift : comparative satellite images highlight the extent of the damage in the brazilian state of rondonia the project " amazon region protected area " -lrb- arpa -rrb- , which is supported by germany , provides a ray of hope .
it was founded by lula 's predecessor fernando henrique cardoso who , in 1998 , vowed to designate 12 percent of the rain forest as an officially protected zone by 2012 .
that has now been postponed to 2016 and there are plans to declare the entire 600,000 square kilometers -lrb- 231,660 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest as a protected zone by then .
some progress has already been made .
so far around 390,000 square kilometers -lrb- 150,580 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest has been marked as a federally-protected zone .
but the gtz says that only half of that - just four percent of the amazon rain forest - is strictly protected . that 's too less , according to the group .
critics trace the lowest rate of deforestation in 2009 to the global financial crisis .
" the demand for beef , soya and wood has dramatically fallen , " paulo adario of greenpeace said .
but he added that slowing deforestation has little to do with efforts to protect the climate .
that means in the worst-case scenario , the brazilian rainforest faces another wave of erosion as soon as world markets begin clamoring for brazil 's exports again .

lula said the un is the right forum for discussions about climate change .
controversial dam project lula 's policy on protecting the environment and the rain forest became apparent in early february when brazil 's environment agency ibama approved the construction of a controversial hydro-electric dam belo monte in the middle of the amazon rain forest .
when it is completed , belo monte will be the third largest hydro-electric dam in the world , after the three gorges in china and itaipu , which is jointly run by brazil and paraguay .
it is expected to provide electricity to 23 million brazilian homes .
but residents as well as environmental activists have protested the building of the mega dam in the brazilian state of para .
the justice ministry in para has even tried to prevent the project but lula 's government has stood firm and pushed the project , estimated to cost billions .
construction is slated to begin later in 2010 - a year in which brazil holds general elections .
some 20,000 indigenous people are to be resettled and some 516 square kilometers -lrb- 199 square miles -rrb- of rain forest are to be flooded for the dam 's construction .

it 's no surprise considering that one of brazil 's leading exports includes beef used in burgers in fast food chains around the world .
that has made cattle ranching more profitable for farmers and encouraged them to deforest .
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations -lrb- fao -rrb- said in march that these business interests have led brazil to sacrifice an average of 26,000 square kilometers -lrb- 10,040 square miles -rrb- of forest each year in the past decade .
the rapid pace of deforestation has done irreparable damage to the so-called " air conditioner " of the world , as environmental activists call the rainforest .
the amazon acts as a " carbon sink , " absorbing carbon dioxide but once the trees are cut down , this absorption stops .
often the wood is burned , releasing carbon , and the loss of forest cover can also lead to carbon release from the soil .
the forest also releases enough water to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration to influence world climate patterns .
a ray of hope the gtz , a german state-owned organization working for sustainable development worldwide , says that the environment laws passed in brazil so far ca n't stop the destruction of the country 's tropical forests .
it estimates that around 680,000 square kilometers -lrb- 262,550 square miles -rrb- of rain forest in the amazon or 17 percent of its original area has been destroyed so far .
along the atlantic coast , just seven percent of rain forest has been preserved .

that has now been postponed to 2016 and there are plans to declare the entire 600,000 square kilometers -lrb- 231,660 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest as a protected zone by then .
some progress has already been made .
so far around 390,000 square kilometers -lrb- 150,580 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest has been marked as a federally-protected zone .

critics trace the lowest rate of deforestation in 2009 to the global financial crisis .
" the demand for beef , soya and wood has dramatically fallen , " paulo adario of greenpeace said .

speaking during a debate in the european parliament in strasbourg , rehn said that the decision to cut greece 's rating was both " surprising " and " unfortunate " at a time when eu and imf auditors were taking a hard look at the country 's attempts to slash its debt .
the eu commissioner said that the downgrade , which he had discussed with financial services commissioner michel barnier and european commission president jose manuel barroso , " again raises issues related to the role of credit rating agencies in the financial system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn says the credit rating industry needs a shake-up rehn said that the eu commission , which is seeking to regulate ratings agencies under new reforms due to be implemented in 2011 , will probe " the level of competition in the sector " and fears that a lack of transparency could represent a " conflict of interest . "
not everyone surprised but many financial experts say the downgrade by moody 's was not totally unexpected given that rival ratings agency standard and poor 's downgraded greece 's sovereign debt to junk status in april , while fitch , the other major ratings agency , warned weeks later that it , too , may follow .
" nothing has really changed since then , " said alcidi cinzia , a research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
" the agency has just put down on paper what the market has been thinking for some time , " she told deutsche welle .
questionable creditworthiness in a statement issued monday , moody 's justified its decision to lower greece 's creditworthiness rating by four notches from a3 to ba1 by pointing to considerable market uncertainty surrounding the country 's plans to reduce its huge debt and balance its finances – even with the help of the eu-imf bailout package .
moody 's describes the ba1 rating as below investment grade - or " junk " status in market parlance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister george papandreou has been facing some tough questions the downgrade means some investors will no longer be allowed to buy greek debt under the terms of their investment mandate and could lead to still higher borrowing costs for athens if it goes to the markets for cash .
observers agree that the downgrade is yet another blow to the debt-ridden country , which is under intense international scrutiny .
last month , it narrowly avoided default after the european union and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- agreed to intervene with a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- bailout .
the bailout from the eu and the imf means that greece is highly unlikely to default in the short term , if at all .
and it gives the country a few years to get its fiscal act together .
cut spending , promote growth but the bailout is a loan - not a gift - meaning that it adds to greece 's debt .
to climb out of trouble , the country will need to cut spending and , at the same time , grow its economy .
while experts agree this will be a difficult trick to pull off , the greek government has been trying hard to promote confidence in its plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks protest the government 's sweeping austerity program so , understandably , officials in athens were n't happy with moody 's call , especially its timing .
shortly after the ratings agency released its statement , the greek ministry of finance fired off it own .
" moody 's downgrade of greek government bonds today does not reflect in any way greece 's progress over the past months , " the ministry wrote .
" nor does it reflect the potential created by the country 's effort of fiscal consolidation and increased competitiveness . "
" greece is moving ahead with all the reforms stipulated in the memorandum of understanding , -lrb- and -rrb- for many of these reforms , it is already ahead of schedule . "

although recycling can help protect the environment and save resources , a closer look at the electronic scrap business reveals an extremely harmful industry .
it represents a massive health hazard for those whose job it is to sort out the old computers , cd players and printers from the west . " take a look , no problem . "
harish puts his bare hands into a big plastic container that is filled with a greenish liquid , which is bubbling at the surface .
it turns out to be nitric acid .
it burns the eyes and the nose if you hold your head too close . harish , who works on the outskirts of delhi on an industrial estate that has not been approved by the state , does know that his job could damage his health , especially his respiratory tracts .
but what else can he do , he asks .
he has no qualifications . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large amount of the world 's electronic waste goes to india for recycling dangerous process ravi aggarwal works with the ngo toxics link .
he explains how dangerous the chemical etching process is – anything that can fetch money is put in an acid bath : " it is extremely corrosive , which is the whole idea .
so when you put an epoxy board in it , then it melts away the board and leaves the copper to be stripped and to be recycled .
it can cause very strong burns , and when you throw it out , it will corrode everything around it .
but there are also fumes which come out . " the recyclers then sell on the copper from the electronic scrap that has come from all over the world – often by illegal means , says aggarwal : " all the e-waste that comes in comes in not as e-waste but under other categories or permitted ways , such as ' mixed metal scrap ' .
so we have seen containers and tracked bills of entry , which are customs documents , which contain e-waste .
our estimate is from 50,000 to 60,000 tons of electronic waste per year at least that has come in . " bildunterschrift : a worker sorts electronic equipment for recycling government ambivalent india 's coast is long and there are hardly any controls .
however , recently a scandal erupted when radioactive scrap was found on a garbage heap in the middle of delhi .
the government has promised to take action and laws are currently under debate but ravi aggarwal is skeptical . " it is very easy to stop .
you just have to put scanners at the ports and you can stop it .
but i think there is an ambivalence in government policy , because the government is saying : ok , we do n't want it , but it is good for the economy .
so , all the policy statements have been ambivalent about it .
i think this ambivalence means that they are not really serious about stopping it . " recently , government officials have started appearing at the industrial estate on the outskirts of delhi , a place where there are literally towers of garbage .
they have banned the use of acid baths and the burning of poisonous scrap . however , a man who runs a small recycling business doubts whether people will heed the government 's warnings .
he says he is not worried at all .
anyone whose business is shut down will just be able to move somewhere else .
he is sure that electronic scrap will continue to end up in india . author : kai kuestner / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

together with the selecao and north korea , those two squads comprise one of the strongest , and certainly the strangest , " group of death " in world cup history .
there are compelling storylines galore : a former colonial power up against an ersatz colony , the top soccer nation on the planet taking on the world 's most secretive country , two of the sport 's top stars bidding for elusive international success , and the top team in africa trying to measure up to the best of south america .

dunga has emphasized tactical solidity over technical flash , leaving stars such as ronaldinho out of the squad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : oil spill in the gulf of mexico the oil disaster the world prefers to ignore bp oil spill must have global consequences , says former un expert obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist full oil spill compensation looks increasingly unlikely disasters -pipe- 15.06.2010 americans vent anger over oil spill differently from europeans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a lack of mass protests by fishermen in the gulf states compared to earlier oil disasters in europe where thousands took to the streets , the outcry in the us over the bp spill seems rather restrained .
but the lack of mass rallies should n't be seen as a lack of public anger . when the oil tanker erika sank and broke apart off the french coast in december 1999 , the public was outraged .
an estimated crowd of 20,000 demonstrated at a rally in nantes against french oil giant total whose leased vessel had spilled approximately three million gallons of oil .
the disaster killed as many as 75,000 birds and spoiled around 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- of the coast .
three years later when the oil tanker prestige sank off the galician coast causing spain 's biggest environmental catastrophe in history , the spaniards took the the streets as well .
at least 12,000 demonstrators gathered at one rally in barcelona alone to voice their anger over the crisis management of the spanish government .
the prestige 's spill of around 20 million gallons of oil contaminated large parts of the french and spanish coasts .
the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico dwarfs both the erika and prestige disasters .
according to recent revised estimates the deepwater horizon rig has already leaked between 42 and 100 million gallons into the water with no end in sight .
that means the bp leak is causing a spill the size of the exxon valez disaster every five to 13 days .
it is by far the worst environmental disaster in us history .
few protestors at bp headquarters and yet after weeks of uninterrupted spilling , a recent rally at bp 's washington headquarters according to media reports attracted only a few dozen protesters .
a protest event in new orleans , which is directly affected by the spill , also drew only some 200 people according to media reports . " that 's not the us style , " michael e. kraft , professor of public and environmental affairs at the university of wisconsin-green bay , told deutsche welle .
" people do n't protest like that over almost anything .
but i would n't take that to mean that there is a lack of public concern . "
his colleague christoph goerg , an expert for global environmental governance at the leipzig-based helmholtz centre for environmental research , agrees : " i do n't think that the environmental consciousness in the us is generally less-developed than in europe . "
goerg believes that the absence of mass gatherings is a characteristic of the political culture in the us and the ability and the willingness of the people to articulate themselves publicly .
" what is definitely different especially compared to france , but also spain , is that in those countries there are very strong lobby groups of fishermen , but also farmers who are able not only to articulate themselves , but also to organize the people most affected by the spill and give them a public platform . " opinion polls show frustration of crisis management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of spaniards demonstrated after the prestige disaster while americans may not flock to the streets , numerous opinion surveys show that the us public is in fact deeply worried about the disaster .
seventy percent of americans , according to one poll , disapprove of bp 's handling of the crisis .
president barack obama 's crisis management has also been heavily criticized .
there are also indications of a significant shift in public opinion over offshore drilling .
in florida , one of the worst affected states , according to a new poll 51 percent of floridians now oppose new offshore drilling .
before the disaster 66 percent were in favor of drilling and only 27 against it .
but is there no way to gauge the public sentiment beyond mere surveys ?
sure , say the experts .
just log on to the internet or turn on the television .
since the explosion on the oil rig , news crews are present covering the spill around the clock .
comedians like bill maher and jon stewart have targeted bp and the obama administration repeatedly .
and in the gulf states many locals have displayed placards and posters showing their frustration over bp , but also over the government 's response .
anti-bp art on the internet on the internet new groups and websites devoted to the disaster are springing up every day .
one of the biggest ones , the boycott bp group on facebook , attracts thousands of new supporters daily and currently has more than 600,000 fans .
and at the popular blog huffington post readers can vent their anger with anti-bp art .
" the public sphere is not the street alone anymore , but also the internet with its various media outlets , " explains goerg .
" a lot of public discourse is carried out over the internet in a new kind of way that also creates new forms of publicity . "
bildunterschrift : oil companies like bp face tougher regulations and higher liability this , argues goerg , has both positive and negative aspects .
" when one attends a rally with others this is something different than when one is active on twitter or voices an opinion somewhere else on the internet , " he says .
" that is more difficult during a public rally , but on the other hand , the connection with others is stronger and one feels more like being part of a group . " the most important benchmark for the effectiveness of public sentiment over the oil spill though , argues kraft , may not be how many people attend a rally , but whether the disaster affects change .
" i think you will see some real public policy changes .
almost certainly there will be very substantial increases in environmental and safety restrictions . "
and , add the experts , one of the most important things to do is to make sure that companies like bp have a very strong financial interest in ensuring that something like this never happens again .
this process has already begun , notes kraft : " the price of bp stock has plummeted since the disaster by something like 40 percent or $ 73 billion -lrb- 60 billion euros -rrb- . so the reaction here may be a little more subtle than it is in europe . "

the south should last longer while nobody will admit to arriving at the world cup just to make up the numbers , the realists among the 32 nations competing will know that it 's highly unlikely that they 'll get out of the group stages . no-one can say what will happen at a world cup .
previous form means little in the heat of battle at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
good teams can have bad days and bad teams can have good ones .
but there are certain teams who arrive with barely a shred of hope of getting out of the group stage .
they may make things difficult for their group opponents and maybe pull off a shock on their way out of the competition , but these are the teams who arrive with no expectations and who are just happy to be there .
there are a number of teams who may struggle in the group stages but here , deutsche welle takes a look at three teams who may already have their return tickets booked for june 26th when the knock-out stage begins .
north korea the team from the one of the world 's most secretive and repressive states is apparently resorting to type in south africa by keeping its preparations and players under cover .
journalists are given short shrift , while training sessions - which every other team has opened to the public - are held behind closed doors .
perhaps north korea are just afraid at showing their group c rivals just how bad they are .
saying that , they are at the world cup for the first time since they famously reached the quarter-finals of the 1966 finals so they ca n't be that bad – can they ?
bildunterschrift : let 's hope that the north korean team are as well-drilled and co-ordinated as their supporters qualifying from the asia conference after beating the likes of saudi arabia , jordan and united arab emirates , and holding their own with their more experienced southern neighbors , north korea – known as the chollima , a mythical horse too swift to be mounted – start with a clean slate , just like everyone else at the 2010 world cup .
but after failing to make the finals at any point in the last 44 years and finding themselves in the " group of death " with brazil , portugal and the ivory coast , it does n't matter how good or bad they are , the smart money is on north korea heading home after three games .
the team , ranked 105th in the world , is made up predominantly of players who feature in north korean teams with only a handful playing outside of the ironhanded communist state .
jong tae-se , known as asia 's wayne rooney , and an yong-hak play in japan 's j-league while striker hong yong-jo plays for russia 's fc rostov .
such is the nature of the country 's regime , very little is known about the rest of the team .
new zealand coming from one of the most laid-back countries on earth , the all whites arrive in south africa under no illusions .
faced with a group featuring world champions italy , paraguay and slovakia , the new zealand team accepts that their world cup is likely to end at the group stage .
this will not stop them from giving their all and enjoying the experience to the fullest .
bildunterschrift : the all whites - here in all black - may not be world beaters but they might make it harder for others however , instead of arriving expecting to get thrashed , the all whites are quietly confident that they can at least give their group f opponents a few headaches after a 1-0 friendly victory over serbia and feisty defeats to chile , to whom they lost 2-0 , and a close 2-1 loss to oceania rivals australia .
while they might not be heading for knock-out stage qualification themselves , their involvement in the tournament may at least dictate who out of their group opponents ' progress .
the minnows from the cinematic middle earth have only featured in one other word cup , in spain in 1982 , when they lost all three matches .
much like what is expected from this tournament , the all whites gave a good account of themselves in a difficult group featuring brazil , the soviet union and scotland .
honduras if facing one of the world cup favorites , a plucky european battler , and one of the best teams in south america -lrb- on current form -rrb- is n't bad enough , honduras arrive in south africa without a win to their name since january 's 2-1 victory over the united states .
they recently struggled in a goalless draw with azerbaijan , labored to a 2-2 draw against belarus and also got beaten 3-0 by non-qualifier romania in their final friendly before heading to the world cup .
getting the type of results to beat spain , switzerland and chile to qualify from group h may be a tall order for honduras on current form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavon and co. are already being written off back home there is quality in the side , which features tottenham hotspur midfielder wilson palacios , as well as an experienced strike force made up of david suazo , who plays for genoa in italy 's serie a , and the ageless carlos pavon .
the 36-year-old pavon is closing in on the two-decade mark in a career which has taken him to 15 clubs and counting , in countries as disparate as italy , spain , colombia , and the united states but the team 's confidence wo n't be helped by news from home that the majority of supporters are horrified by their pre-world cup form .
pressure is building on colombian-born coach reinaldo rueda who is accused by many pundits back in honduras of having no idea as to how he wants the team to play .
with spain looking more dangerous than ever , the swiss capable of either genius or farce under ottmar hitzfeld , and high-scoring chile obsessed with fast-tempo attacking play , the best honduras can hope for is a result against switzerland and damage control against the spaniards and chileans before flying home to face their rabid press .

group g. and though brazil are favored , no one knows what the table will look like in the end . when ivory coast kick off against portugal on tuesday afternoon , a tournament that 's thus far been somewhat short of highlights will probably shift up a gear .
together with the selecao and north korea , those two squads comprise one of the strongest , and certainly the strangest , " group of death " in world cup history .
there are compelling storylines galore : a former colonial power up against an ersatz colony , the top soccer nation on the planet taking on the world 's most secretive country , two of the sport 's top stars bidding for elusive international success , and the top team in africa trying to measure up to the best of south america .
one thing is clear .
of brazil , portugal and ivory coast , at least one team will be making an early exit .
and which team that is could come down to an intriguing joker thrown into the deck , north korea .
worries , real or feigned bildunterschrift : brazil remain the favorites all coaches of teams that are heavily favored mouth pieties about the need to respect every opponent .
but brazil 's coach carlos dunga does seem to be taking the selecao 's opening match against north korea surprisingly seriously , closing several of the team 's final practices to the public .
brazil breezed through qualifying , but this is not the same sort of team fans are used to seeing from south america 's largest nation .
dunga has emphasized tactical solidity over technical flash , leaving stars such as ronaldinho out of the squad .
the selecao still have a surfeit of talent , of course , with forward robinho and midfield general kaka both fit and capable of scoring the goals brazil need .
still , brazil 's players are sticking to the humble script .
" when we look at history , brazil may have many more titles than they do , but once the match starts we will need to have the same respect as we would have to any other team , " midfielder elano told germany 's dpa news agency ahead of the match with north korea .
and legendary former brazil player socrates told the bbc before the start of tournament that they were fielding a too-workmanlike squad of players with questionable fitness , and predicted the selecao would have difficulties in the group stage .
astonishingly , it 's been the underdogs doing most of the big talking .
the asian wayne rooney bildunterschrift : the man on the right is considered the asian wayne north korea have only taken part in one previous world cup , and that was back in 1966 - although they did score a shocking upset of italy in the group stage .
but their coach kim jong-hun says the outsiders do indeed have a chance in the toughest of all groups .
" in football , the best teams do n't necessarily win , " kim told the afp news agency .
" we will give it our best .
we know we need to win to reach the knockout phase , so no matter who we 're up against , we 'll target the three points . "
almost the entire squad plays its football in the domestic north korean league .
but striker jong tae-se plies his trade in japan , where he has become known as the " asian wayne rooney . "
" the match will be very difficult , but we can beat brazil , " jong told dpa .
" our team has a mentality similar to the german one , which is the best in the world . "
anticipation is making him wait bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drogba is working hard on his comeback ahead of the ivory coast-portugal clash , much of the attention has focussed on two superstars .
ivory coast are hoping that striker didier drogba can recover from a fractured elbow picked up in a pre-tournament friendly .
his status is touch-and-go .
but even if les elephants have to do without their top scorer , the players think they ' ve gained enough discipline under new coach sven-goran eriksson to get the results that have eluded them in the past .
" we 've always had good players but have never been able to properly work together as an effective unit , defending and attacking as one , " ivory coast defender kolo toure told dpa .
" that 's what we 've been working on , and we hope that it will bear fruit , starting with our first match versus portugal . "
on the other side , portugal hope their superstar , cristiano ronaldo , the 2008-09 footballer of the year , can end a 16-month scoreless streak in international competition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ronaldo is keeping his head up but cr7 would n't be cr7 , if he lacked confidence .
" it 's like a great player once told me , goals are like ketchup , " ronaldo told dpa .
" you keep on forcing it , then it comes all at once . "
portugese fans better hope the ketchup starts flowing because scoring goals - lots of them - may be the key to surviving this group .
the tie-breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the group could be a lottery in the end in a group this tight , it 's entirely possible that two teams might end up level on points in second place in the final table .
according to the rules laid out by football 's world governing body fifa , goal difference is to be used to break any ties .
and that would make an 8-nil thrashing of north korea , for instance , of enormous value .
even stranger would be the scenario if three teams ended up level on points .
the goal-difference rule applies there as well , but there has considerable confusion about precisely how it , and other rules , would be applied in this unlikely but possible scenario .
if else fails , the decision will be made by flipping a coin .
that is extremely , extremely unlikely , but anything could happen in a group of death with more than its fair share of oddities .

the destruction of the rain forest alone is said to be responsible for around half of brazil 's greenhouse gas emissions .
the latin american country is the world 's fifth-largest polluter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of the chainsaw is increasingly part of daily life in the rainforest brazil 's president luiz inacio lula da silva reportedly wants to reduce the amount of amazon rain forest being cleared by 80 percent by 2020 .
but lula insists that the main responsibility for sustainable climate protection lies with the united nations .
following the failure of global climate talks in copenhagen last december , lula reportedly urged un secretary-general ban ki moon during a private meeting to press for a global agreement .
lula said the un is the right forum for discussions about climate change .
controversial dam project lula 's policy on protecting the environment and the rain forest became apparent in early february when brazil 's environment agency ibama approved the construction of a controversial hydro-electric dam belo monte in the middle of the amazon rain forest .
when it is completed , belo monte will be the third largest hydro-electric dam in the world , after the three gorges in china and itaipu , which is jointly run by brazil and paraguay .
it is expected to provide electricity to 23 million brazilian homes .
but residents as well as environmental activists have protested the building of the mega dam in the brazilian state of para .
the justice ministry in para has even tried to prevent the project but lula 's government has stood firm and pushed the project , estimated to cost billions .
construction is slated to begin later in 2010 - a year in which brazil holds general elections .
some 20,000 indigenous people are to be resettled and some 516 square kilometers -lrb- 199 square miles -rrb- of rain forest are to be flooded for the dam 's construction .
business interests damaging rain forest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainforest is being cleared away to make room for lucrative cattle ranching despite pledges by lula 's government to protect the rain forest and the global climate , tree-cutting and the clearing of forests to make way for pastures and cultivation of fields is continuing .
it 's no surprise considering that one of brazil 's leading exports includes beef used in burgers in fast food chains around the world .
that has made cattle ranching more profitable for farmers and encouraged them to deforest .
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations -lrb- fao -rrb- said in march that these business interests have led brazil to sacrifice an average of 26,000 square kilometers -lrb- 10,040 square miles -rrb- of forest each year in the past decade .
the rapid pace of deforestation has done irreparable damage to the so-called " air conditioner " of the world , as environmental activists call the rainforest .
the amazon acts as a " carbon sink , " absorbing carbon dioxide but once the trees are cut down , this absorption stops .
often the wood is burned , releasing carbon , and the loss of forest cover can also lead to carbon release from the soil .
the forest also releases enough water to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration to influence world climate patterns .
a ray of hope the gtz , a german state-owned organization working for sustainable development worldwide , says that the environment laws passed in brazil so far ca n't stop the destruction of the country 's tropical forests .
it estimates that around 680,000 square kilometers -lrb- 262,550 square miles -rrb- of rain forest in the amazon or 17 percent of its original area has been destroyed so far .
along the atlantic coast , just seven percent of rain forest has been preserved .
bildunterschrift : comparative satellite images highlight the extent of the damage in the brazilian state of rondonia the project " amazon region protected area " -lrb- arpa -rrb- , which is supported by germany , provides a ray of hope .
it was founded by lula 's predecessor fernando henrique cardoso who , in 1998 , vowed to designate 12 percent of the rain forest as an officially protected zone by 2012 .
that has now been postponed to 2016 and there are plans to declare the entire 600,000 square kilometers -lrb- 231,660 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest as a protected zone by then .
some progress has already been made .
so far around 390,000 square kilometers -lrb- 150,580 square miles -rrb- of the rain forest has been marked as a federally-protected zone .
but the gtz says that only half of that - just four percent of the amazon rain forest - is strictly protected . that 's too less , according to the group .
critics trace the lowest rate of deforestation in 2009 to the global financial crisis .
" the demand for beef , soya and wood has dramatically fallen , " paulo adario of greenpeace said .
but he added that slowing deforestation has little to do with efforts to protect the climate .
that means in the worst-case scenario , the brazilian rainforest faces another wave of erosion as soon as world markets begin clamoring for brazil 's exports again .

but at home , it 's struggling to juggle powerful business interests with efforts to protect its threatened rainforest . brazil is considered one of the key countries in global efforts to protect the climate .
the destruction of the rain forest alone is said to be responsible for around half of brazil 's greenhouse gas emissions .
the latin american country is the world 's fifth-largest polluter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sound of the chainsaw is increasingly part of daily life in the rainforest brazil 's president luiz inacio lula da silva reportedly wants to reduce the amount of amazon rain forest being cleared by 80 percent by 2020 .
but lula insists that the main responsibility for sustainable climate protection lies with the united nations .
following the failure of global climate talks in copenhagen last december , lula reportedly urged un secretary-general ban ki moon during a private meeting to press for a global agreement .
lula said the un is the right forum for discussions about climate change .
controversial dam project lula 's policy on protecting the environment and the rain forest became apparent in early february when brazil 's environment agency ibama approved the construction of a controversial hydro-electric dam belo monte in the middle of the amazon rain forest .
when it is completed , belo monte will be the third largest hydro-electric dam in the world , after the three gorges in china and itaipu , which is jointly run by brazil and paraguay .
it is expected to provide electricity to 23 million brazilian homes .
but residents as well as environmental activists have protested the building of the mega dam in the brazilian state of para .
the justice ministry in para has even tried to prevent the project but lula 's government has stood firm and pushed the project , estimated to cost billions .
construction is slated to begin later in 2010 - a year in which brazil holds general elections .
some 20,000 indigenous people are to be resettled and some 516 square kilometers -lrb- 199 square miles -rrb- of rain forest are to be flooded for the dam 's construction .
business interests damaging rain forest ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rainforest is being cleared away to make room for lucrative cattle ranching despite pledges by lula 's government to protect the rain forest and the global climate , tree-cutting and the clearing of forests to make way for pastures and cultivation of fields is continuing .
it 's no surprise considering that one of brazil 's leading exports includes beef used in burgers in fast food chains around the world .
that has made cattle ranching more profitable for farmers and encouraged them to deforest .
the food and agriculture organization of the united nations -lrb- fao -rrb- said in march that these business interests have led brazil to sacrifice an average of 26,000 square kilometers -lrb- 10,040 square miles -rrb- of forest each year in the past decade .
the rapid pace of deforestation has done irreparable damage to the so-called " air conditioner " of the world , as environmental activists call the rainforest .
the amazon acts as a " carbon sink , " absorbing carbon dioxide but once the trees are cut down , this absorption stops .
often the wood is burned , releasing carbon , and the loss of forest cover can also lead to carbon release from the soil .
the forest also releases enough water to the atmosphere via evapotranspiration to influence world climate patterns .
a ray of hope the gtz , a german state-owned organization working for sustainable development worldwide , says that the environment laws passed in brazil so far ca n't stop the destruction of the country 's tropical forests .
it estimates that around 680,000 square kilometers -lrb- 262,550 square miles -rrb- of rain forest in the amazon or 17 percent of its original area has been destroyed so far .
along the atlantic coast , just seven percent of rain forest has been preserved .

the ministers reviewed a statement that would have iceland start formal accession talks , despite an outstanding dispute with britain and the netherlands surrounding the 2008 failure of the bank icesave .
the british and dutch governments have demanded iceland pay some of the 3.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- in deposits that they gave to clients in their respective countries who lost money in the icelandic bank .
the netherlands and the uk had threatened to block iceland 's entry talks , but british foreign secretary william hague said he had received assurance that iceland intended to pay its fair share .

long road for serbia another country to move closer to eu membership monday was serbia , although the balkan state has a longer road ahead of it than iceland .
the foreign ministers agreed to implement with serbia the stabilization and association agreement , an aid and trade agreement that is recognized as the first official step to full eu membership .
the decision was reportedly based on serbia 's improved cooperation with the united nations-sponsored international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia in the hague .
the court 's chief prosecutor , serge brammertz , briefed the ministers on serbia 's efforts to search out an capture indicted genocide suspect ratko mladic .
but british foreign secretary hague added that there is still " no positive news about the arrest , " and that " serbia has not completed its task . "

but the lack of mass rallies should n't be seen as a lack of public anger . when the oil tanker erika sank and broke apart off the french coast in december 1999 , the public was outraged .
an estimated crowd of 20,000 demonstrated at a rally in nantes against french oil giant total whose leased vessel had spilled approximately three million gallons of oil .
the disaster killed as many as 75,000 birds and spoiled around 400 kilometers -lrb- 250 miles -rrb- of the coast .
three years later when the oil tanker prestige sank off the galician coast causing spain 's biggest environmental catastrophe in history , the spaniards took the the streets as well .
at least 12,000 demonstrators gathered at one rally in barcelona alone to voice their anger over the crisis management of the spanish government .
the prestige 's spill of around 20 million gallons of oil contaminated large parts of the french and spanish coasts .
the bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico dwarfs both the erika and prestige disasters .
according to recent revised estimates the deepwater horizon rig has already leaked between 42 and 100 million gallons into the water with no end in sight .
that means the bp leak is causing a spill the size of the exxon valez disaster every five to 13 days .
it is by far the worst environmental disaster in us history .
few protestors at bp headquarters and yet after weeks of uninterrupted spilling , a recent rally at bp 's washington headquarters according to media reports attracted only a few dozen protesters .
a protest event in new orleans , which is directly affected by the spill , also drew only some 200 people according to media reports . " that 's not the us style , " michael e. kraft , professor of public and environmental affairs at the university of wisconsin-green bay , told deutsche welle .
" people do n't protest like that over almost anything .
but i would n't take that to mean that there is a lack of public concern . "
his colleague christoph goerg , an expert for global environmental governance at the leipzig-based helmholtz centre for environmental research , agrees : " i do n't think that the environmental consciousness in the us is generally less-developed than in europe . "
goerg believes that the absence of mass gatherings is a characteristic of the political culture in the us and the ability and the willingness of the people to articulate themselves publicly .
" what is definitely different especially compared to france , but also spain , is that in those countries there are very strong lobby groups of fishermen , but also farmers who are able not only to articulate themselves , but also to organize the people most affected by the spill and give them a public platform . " opinion polls show frustration of crisis management bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands of spaniards demonstrated after the prestige disaster while americans may not flock to the streets , numerous opinion surveys show that the us public is in fact deeply worried about the disaster .
seventy percent of americans , according to one poll , disapprove of bp 's handling of the crisis .
president barack obama 's crisis management has also been heavily criticized .
there are also indications of a significant shift in public opinion over offshore drilling .
in florida , one of the worst affected states , according to a new poll 51 percent of floridians now oppose new offshore drilling .
before the disaster 66 percent were in favor of drilling and only 27 against it .
but is there no way to gauge the public sentiment beyond mere surveys ?
sure , say the experts .
just log on to the internet or turn on the television .
since the explosion on the oil rig , news crews are present covering the spill around the clock .
comedians like bill maher and jon stewart have targeted bp and the obama administration repeatedly .
and in the gulf states many locals have displayed placards and posters showing their frustration over bp , but also over the government 's response .
anti-bp art on the internet on the internet new groups and websites devoted to the disaster are springing up every day .
one of the biggest ones , the boycott bp group on facebook , attracts thousands of new supporters daily and currently has more than 600,000 fans .
and at the popular blog huffington post readers can vent their anger with anti-bp art .
" the public sphere is not the street alone anymore , but also the internet with its various media outlets , " explains goerg .
" a lot of public discourse is carried out over the internet in a new kind of way that also creates new forms of publicity . "
bildunterschrift : oil companies like bp face tougher regulations and higher liability this , argues goerg , has both positive and negative aspects .
" when one attends a rally with others this is something different than when one is active on twitter or voices an opinion somewhere else on the internet , " he says .
" that is more difficult during a public rally , but on the other hand , the connection with others is stronger and one feels more like being part of a group . " the most important benchmark for the effectiveness of public sentiment over the oil spill though , argues kraft , may not be how many people attend a rally , but whether the disaster affects change .
" i think you will see some real public policy changes .
almost certainly there will be very substantial increases in environmental and safety restrictions . "
and , add the experts , one of the most important things to do is to make sure that companies like bp have a very strong financial interest in ensuring that something like this never happens again .
this process has already begun , notes kraft : " the price of bp stock has plummeted since the disaster by something like 40 percent or $ 73 billion -lrb- 60 billion euros -rrb- . so the reaction here may be a little more subtle than it is in europe . "

speaking during a debate in the european parliament in strasbourg , rehn said that the decision to cut greece 's rating was both " surprising " and " unfortunate " at a time when eu and imf auditors were taking a hard look at the country 's attempts to slash its debt .
the eu commissioner said that the downgrade , which he had discussed with financial services commissioner michel barnier and european commission president jose manuel barroso , " again raises issues related to the role of credit rating agencies in the financial system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn says the credit rating industry needs a shake-up rehn said that the eu commission , which is seeking to regulate ratings agencies under new reforms due to be implemented in 2011 , will probe " the level of competition in the sector " and fears that a lack of transparency could represent a " conflict of interest . "
not everyone surprised but many financial experts say the downgrade by moody 's was not totally unexpected given that rival ratings agency standard and poor 's downgraded greece 's sovereign debt to junk status in april , while fitch , the other major ratings agency , warned weeks later that it , too , may follow .
" nothing has really changed since then , " said alcidi cinzia , a research fellow at the centre for european policy studies -lrb- ceps -rrb- in brussels .
" the agency has just put down on paper what the market has been thinking for some time , " she told deutsche welle .
questionable creditworthiness in a statement issued monday , moody 's justified its decision to lower greece 's creditworthiness rating by four notches from a3 to ba1 by pointing to considerable market uncertainty surrounding the country 's plans to reduce its huge debt and balance its finances – even with the help of the eu-imf bailout package .
moody 's describes the ba1 rating as below investment grade - or " junk " status in market parlance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister george papandreou has been facing some tough questions the downgrade means some investors will no longer be allowed to buy greek debt under the terms of their investment mandate and could lead to still higher borrowing costs for athens if it goes to the markets for cash .
observers agree that the downgrade is yet another blow to the debt-ridden country , which is under intense international scrutiny .
last month , it narrowly avoided default after the european union and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- agreed to intervene with a 110 billion euro -lrb- $ 130 billion -rrb- bailout .
the bailout from the eu and the imf means that greece is highly unlikely to default in the short term , if at all .
and it gives the country a few years to get its fiscal act together .
cut spending , promote growth but the bailout is a loan - not a gift - meaning that it adds to greece 's debt .
to climb out of trouble , the country will need to cut spending and , at the same time , grow its economy .
while experts agree this will be a difficult trick to pull off , the greek government has been trying hard to promote confidence in its plans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greeks protest the government 's sweeping austerity program so , understandably , officials in athens were n't happy with moody 's call , especially its timing .
shortly after the ratings agency released its statement , the greek ministry of finance fired off it own .
" moody 's downgrade of greek government bonds today does not reflect in any way greece 's progress over the past months , " the ministry wrote .
" nor does it reflect the potential created by the country 's effort of fiscal consolidation and increased competitiveness . "
" greece is moving ahead with all the reforms stipulated in the memorandum of understanding , -lrb- and -rrb- for many of these reforms , it is already ahead of schedule . "

although recycling can help protect the environment and save resources , a closer look at the electronic scrap business reveals an extremely harmful industry .
it represents a massive health hazard for those whose job it is to sort out the old computers , cd players and printers from the west . " take a look , no problem . "
harish puts his bare hands into a big plastic container that is filled with a greenish liquid , which is bubbling at the surface .
it turns out to be nitric acid .
it burns the eyes and the nose if you hold your head too close . harish , who works on the outskirts of delhi on an industrial estate that has not been approved by the state , does know that his job could damage his health , especially his respiratory tracts .
but what else can he do , he asks .
he has no qualifications . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large amount of the world 's electronic waste goes to india for recycling dangerous process ravi aggarwal works with the ngo toxics link .
he explains how dangerous the chemical etching process is – anything that can fetch money is put in an acid bath : " it is extremely corrosive , which is the whole idea .
so when you put an epoxy board in it , then it melts away the board and leaves the copper to be stripped and to be recycled .
it can cause very strong burns , and when you throw it out , it will corrode everything around it .
but there are also fumes which come out . " the recyclers then sell on the copper from the electronic scrap that has come from all over the world – often by illegal means , says aggarwal : " all the e-waste that comes in comes in not as e-waste but under other categories or permitted ways , such as ' mixed metal scrap ' .
so we have seen containers and tracked bills of entry , which are customs documents , which contain e-waste .
our estimate is from 50,000 to 60,000 tons of electronic waste per year at least that has come in . " bildunterschrift : a worker sorts electronic equipment for recycling government ambivalent india 's coast is long and there are hardly any controls .
however , recently a scandal erupted when radioactive scrap was found on a garbage heap in the middle of delhi .
the government has promised to take action and laws are currently under debate but ravi aggarwal is skeptical . " it is very easy to stop .
you just have to put scanners at the ports and you can stop it .
but i think there is an ambivalence in government policy , because the government is saying : ok , we do n't want it , but it is good for the economy .
so , all the policy statements have been ambivalent about it .
i think this ambivalence means that they are not really serious about stopping it . " recently , government officials have started appearing at the industrial estate on the outskirts of delhi , a place where there are literally towers of garbage .
they have banned the use of acid baths and the burning of poisonous scrap . however , a man who runs a small recycling business doubts whether people will heed the government 's warnings .
he says he is not worried at all .
anyone whose business is shut down will just be able to move somewhere else .
he is sure that electronic scrap will continue to end up in india . author : kai kuestner / act editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics fear full compensation for environmental and economic damage is unlikely . more than six weeks after the now infamous sinking of the deepwater horizon oil rig in the gulf of mexico , efforts to staunch crude oil flowing from an underwater well have only partially succeeded .
meanwhile , the environmental and financial tolls of the catastrophe have yet to be fully assessed .
tourism and fishing industries along the gulf of mexico have suffered devastating effects as oil washes ashore and vast areas of water are polluted , killing wildlife .
bp has stopped referring to the catastrophe using the name of the " deepwater horizon " rig in favor of using the short-form name of the well it dug , " mc252 . "
it has also limited press access to affected areas , limited the release of information and bought up spill-related online search terms at major search engines .
obama foresees policy changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said the spill will shape future environment and energy policies w hile bp has already agreed to some financial compensation , skeptics doubt the full costs of the spill will ever be recovered .
currently bp is collecting about 15,000 barrels of oil a day – about half the amount believed to be leaking .
the company 's latest plan follows pressure from the obama administration and calls for more than 50,000 barrels a day to be collected by the end of june .
the well is expected to continue leaking until bp completes the first of two relief wells in august .
obama said in a recent interview the spill would alter us policy during coming years .
he has also lamented the threat posed to the gulf of mexico coastline with its wildlife-filled wetlands , beaches and waters teeming with shrimps , crabs and fish .
" in the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9/11 , i think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come , " he told the washington-based news organization politico .
fair compensation doubted a number of ngos fear that local populations and ecosystems will ultimately shoulder the catastrophe 's most significant burdens while bp minimizes losses for itself and its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers cleaning up spilled oil may later suffer health problems greenpeace spokeswoman cindy baxter said she expects a scenario similar to the aftermath of the 1989 exxon valdez spill , during which 40,000 tons of crude oil leaked into alaska 's prince william sound .
that resulted in a 19-year legal process over a five-billion-dollar compensation deal .
" exxon has taken it through the courts , and through the courts , and through the courts .
the original five billion dollars ?
that estimated amount of compensation has now been reduced to $ 500 million .
people who wanted compensation died looking for it .
that includes workers who were working on the spill and have had huge amounts of health problems from working with the dispersants that they used , " she told deutsche welle .
economic interests at risk in addition to the damage caused by the current disaster , experts say prospecting for fossil fuels will likely become riskier in the future as energy demand rises and easily accessible resources dwindle .
advocates for renewable energy sources have been quick to point this out .
felix matthes , an expert on renewable energy at the berlin institute for applied ecology , says aggressive development of renewable energy infrastructure is a necessary investment which can be unified with economic interests .
" this catastrophe in the gulf of mexico has made it clear that the current use of energy – especially as accessing raw materials becomes ever more complicated , and this access means disturbing ever more delicate ecosystems – can come at a high cost , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp may shirk fully compensating affected locals like fishermen but the global economy is still based on oil , and the oil industry enjoys political protections .
the united states ' 1990 oil pollution act , signed into law by president george bush sr. , limits liability in the case of a spill to $ 75 million .
similarly , louisiana 's senator mary landrieu has taken a stance protecting the oil industry as a whole .
david cadman of the organization local governments for sustainability said he believes bp has failed to put enough emphasis on cleanup efforts .
" the previous bush administration basically limited the liability of the oil companies in case of an accident , and i think that 's going to come home to roost .
all of a sudden we 're going to see the bills , and there 's going to be a great fight as to who should pay those bills .
and i suspect bp is going to say : ' this is the agreement we had .
we pay up to this and no more . " '

critics fear full compensation for environmental and economic damage is unlikely . more than six weeks after the now infamous sinking of the deepwater horizon oil rig in the gulf of mexico , efforts to staunch crude oil flowing from an underwater well have only partially succeeded .
meanwhile , the environmental and financial tolls of the catastrophe have yet to be fully assessed .
tourism and fishing industries along the gulf of mexico have suffered devastating effects as oil washes ashore and vast areas of water are polluted , killing wildlife .
bp has stopped referring to the catastrophe using the name of the " deepwater horizon " rig in favor of using the short-form name of the well it dug , " mc252 . "
it has also limited press access to affected areas , limited the release of information and bought up spill-related online search terms at major search engines .
obama foresees policy changes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama said the spill will shape future environment and energy policies w hile bp has already agreed to some financial compensation , skeptics doubt the full costs of the spill will ever be recovered .
currently bp is collecting about 15,000 barrels of oil a day – about half the amount believed to be leaking .
the company 's latest plan follows pressure from the obama administration and calls for more than 50,000 barrels a day to be collected by the end of june .
the well is expected to continue leaking until bp completes the first of two relief wells in august .
obama said in a recent interview the spill would alter us policy during coming years .
he has also lamented the threat posed to the gulf of mexico coastline with its wildlife-filled wetlands , beaches and waters teeming with shrimps , crabs and fish .
" in the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9/11 , i think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come , " he told the washington-based news organization politico .
fair compensation doubted a number of ngos fear that local populations and ecosystems will ultimately shoulder the catastrophe 's most significant burdens while bp minimizes losses for itself and its shareholders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers cleaning up spilled oil may later suffer health problems greenpeace spokeswoman cindy baxter said she expects a scenario similar to the aftermath of the 1989 exxon valdez spill , during which 40,000 tons of crude oil leaked into alaska 's prince william sound .
that resulted in a 19-year legal process over a five-billion-dollar compensation deal .
" exxon has taken it through the courts , and through the courts , and through the courts .
the original five billion dollars ?
that estimated amount of compensation has now been reduced to $ 500 million .
people who wanted compensation died looking for it .
that includes workers who were working on the spill and have had huge amounts of health problems from working with the dispersants that they used , " she told deutsche welle .
economic interests at risk in addition to the damage caused by the current disaster , experts say prospecting for fossil fuels will likely become riskier in the future as energy demand rises and easily accessible resources dwindle .
advocates for renewable energy sources have been quick to point this out .
felix matthes , an expert on renewable energy at the berlin institute for applied ecology , says aggressive development of renewable energy infrastructure is a necessary investment which can be unified with economic interests .
" this catastrophe in the gulf of mexico has made it clear that the current use of energy – especially as accessing raw materials becomes ever more complicated , and this access means disturbing ever more delicate ecosystems – can come at a high cost , " he told deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bp may shirk fully compensating affected locals like fishermen but the global economy is still based on oil , and the oil industry enjoys political protections .
the united states ' 1990 oil pollution act , signed into law by president george bush sr. , limits liability in the case of a spill to $ 75 million .
similarly , louisiana 's senator mary landrieu has taken a stance protecting the oil industry as a whole .
david cadman of the organization local governments for sustainability said he believes bp has failed to put enough emphasis on cleanup efforts .
" the previous bush administration basically limited the liability of the oil companies in case of an accident , and i think that 's going to come home to roost .
all of a sudden we 're going to see the bills , and there 's going to be a great fight as to who should pay those bills .
and i suspect bp is going to say : ' this is the agreement we had .
we pay up to this and no more . " '

'
group mates ivory coast and portugal finished scoreless , while a late new zealand goal saved a point against slovakia . in the world cup debut of the so-called ' group of death ' - formally known as group g - brazil emerged on top after its 2-1 win over north korea . perennial world cup favorites brazil dominated possession in the first half but a resolute north korean defense kept coach carlos dunga 's squad from finding the back of the net . brazil kept up the pressure in the second half , continuing to probe north korea 's defense but being turned away every time . that changed in the 55th minute .
brazilian midfielder elano played a through-ball to defender maicon , who fired a nearly sideways shot from less than a meter from the end line .
the ball slipped between north korean keeper ri myong guk and the near post before curving over the line and into the goal . bildunterschrift : north korea was on defense for most of the game the brazilians added a second goal in the 72nd minute .
this time it was elano who took the easy shot following a precision cross from robinho . if history is any guide , it was only a matter of time before one of brazil 's attacks made it through : the brazilians have scored at least one goal in every group stage match of the world cup since 1978 , when they drew 0-0 against spain . north korea pulled one back near the end of the game as forward jong tae se laid down a header in front of defender ji yun nam , who booted the ball over brazilian keeper julio cesar to score in the 89th minute . drogba back in action despite playing a hard-fought match on both sides , neither team in the other group g match between the ivory coast and portugal had a particularly high number of scoring opportunities , and the ones that did come along never resulted in a goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drogba 's broken arm did n't keep him out of the world cup for long one highlight of the game for the ivory coast was the return of their star captain , didier drogba .
the forward broke his arm in a warm-up match against japan 11 days ago , and his status for the group g opener against portugal was questionable . although drogba did n't start , he was subbed in the 66th minute for salomon kalou , a teammate of drogba 's at fc chelsea . the ivory coast 's next match is a big one in the group as they face brazil .
portugal faces north korea on monday . better late than never it took new zealand literally the entire game , but their lone goal against slovakia could n't have come at a better time .
slovakia looked to be on their way to a 1-0 win as the referee indicated three minutes of injury time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reid -lrb- left -rrb- celebrates his last-second goal for new zealand but new zealand put together a hectic offensive sequence after two and a half minutes of injury time and managed to tie the game , salvaging a point in group f with the 1-1 draw . with the final whistle seconds away , new zealand forward shane smeltz delivered a cross to defender winston reid , who connected for a header . slovakia 's goal was nearly identical but came in the 50th minute .
after slowly building up an attack , slovakian forward stanislav sestak launched a curling cross that was right on target for robert vittek to score on a header . the group 's other teams , italy and paraguay , also played to a 1-1 tie on monday night , meaning group f is all square with one point per team . author : matt zuvela editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

'
group mates ivory coast and portugal finished scoreless , while a late new zealand goal saved a point against slovakia . in the world cup debut of the so-called ' group of death ' - formally known as group g - brazil emerged on top after its 2-1 win over north korea . perennial world cup favorites brazil dominated possession in the first half but a resolute north korean defense kept coach carlos dunga 's squad from finding the back of the net . brazil kept up the pressure in the second half , continuing to probe north korea 's defense but being turned away every time . that changed in the 55th minute .
brazilian midfielder elano played a through-ball to defender maicon , who fired a nearly sideways shot from less than a meter from the end line .
the ball slipped between north korean keeper ri myong guk and the near post before curving over the line and into the goal . bildunterschrift : north korea was on defense for most of the game the brazilians added a second goal in the 72nd minute .
this time it was elano who took the easy shot following a precision cross from robinho . if history is any guide , it was only a matter of time before one of brazil 's attacks made it through : the brazilians have scored at least one goal in every group stage match of the world cup since 1978 , when they drew 0-0 against spain . north korea pulled one back near the end of the game as forward jong tae se laid down a header in front of defender ji yun nam , who booted the ball over brazilian keeper julio cesar to score in the 89th minute . drogba back in action despite playing a hard-fought match on both sides , neither team in the other group g match between the ivory coast and portugal had a particularly high number of scoring opportunities , and the ones that did come along never resulted in a goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drogba 's broken arm did n't keep him out of the world cup for long one highlight of the game for the ivory coast was the return of their star captain , didier drogba .
the forward broke his arm in a warm-up match against japan 11 days ago , and his status for the group g opener against portugal was questionable . although drogba did n't start , he was subbed in the 66th minute for salomon kalou , a teammate of drogba 's at fc chelsea . the ivory coast 's next match is a big one in the group as they face brazil .
portugal faces north korea on monday . better late than never it took new zealand literally the entire game , but their lone goal against slovakia could n't have come at a better time .
slovakia looked to be on their way to a 1-0 win as the referee indicated three minutes of injury time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reid -lrb- left -rrb- celebrates his last-second goal for new zealand but new zealand put together a hectic offensive sequence after two and a half minutes of injury time and managed to tie the game , salvaging a point in group f with the 1-1 draw . with the final whistle seconds away , new zealand forward shane smeltz delivered a cross to defender winston reid , who connected for a header . slovakia 's goal was nearly identical but came in the 50th minute .
after slowly building up an attack , slovakian forward stanislav sestak launched a curling cross that was right on target for robert vittek to score on a header . the group 's other teams , italy and paraguay , also played to a 1-1 tie on monday night , meaning group f is all square with one point per team . author : matt zuvela editor : michael lawton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report concludes that british troops were " unjustified " in firing on protestors on that day in 1972 . british prime minister david cameron has apologized on behalf of the british government for the ' bloody sunday ' massacre in northern ireland in 1972 that left 14 civilian protesters dead at the hands of british troops .
cameron presented the results of a massive 12-year inquiry into the incident to parliament on tuesday , saying that the events of bloody sunday were in no way justified .
" what happened should never , ever , have happened , " cameron said .
" some members of our armed forces acted wrongly . "
initial reports made in 1972 showed that british troops had acted appropriately when they fired on catholic civilians in londonderry .
at the time , the troops indicated that they had fired on civilians who were armed .
however , cameron said that this was not the case and added that some troops had deliberately made false statements about the shootings to make it appear that they had been justified in firing .
the report concludes that the british troops fired first and were unprovoked .
" the government is ultimately responsible for the conduct of the armed forces .
and for that , on behalf of the government , indeed on behalf of our country , i am deeply sorry , " cameron said .

the country 's development minister wants to merge them under a single name . development minister dirk niebel announced tuesday that he wants to consolidate three of germany 's international development agencies into one entity , to be called the german association for international cooperation .
niebel said the move would increase efficiency and reduce red tape .
the new institution would include german technical aid organization gtz , the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- , and the international capacity-building agency inwent .
it would officially come into existence on january 1 , 2011 - if the federal cabinet approves the change in a vote scheduled for july 7 .
the three agencies currently employ a total of 17,000 people worldwide .
their replacement would have its headquarters in bonn and a second office in eschborn , near frankfurt .
inwent would retain its 14 regional offices in germany and others maintained with partners throughout the world .
savings will remain in the development budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel 's plans for reform of germany 's development infrastructure are controversial niebel , a member of germany 's pro-business free democratic party , told german television that the move was completely separate from the federal government 's recently announced cost-cutting measures .
" it 's natural , of course , that with increasingly strained public finance , things must be made more efficient , " niebel said .
niebel said he had talked to the finance minister about allowing the savings from the consolidation to remain within the ministry budget - so that although the ministry would not see any funding increases until 2014 , it would n't see any budget cuts , either .
the plan has been criticized by the opposition social democrats ' spokesperson for development policy , sascha raabe .
raabe told the protestant news service -lrb- epd -rrb- that niebel lacked the courage for the required major reforms , and was instead making cosmetic changes .
" that is not going to help our partners in the world , " raabe said .

the country 's development minister wants to merge them under a single name . development minister dirk niebel announced tuesday that he wants to consolidate three of germany 's international development agencies into one entity , to be called the german association for international cooperation .
niebel said the move would increase efficiency and reduce red tape .
the new institution would include german technical aid organization gtz , the german development service -lrb- ded -rrb- , and the international capacity-building agency inwent .
it would officially come into existence on january 1 , 2011 - if the federal cabinet approves the change in a vote scheduled for july 7 .
the three agencies currently employ a total of 17,000 people worldwide .
their replacement would have its headquarters in bonn and a second office in eschborn , near frankfurt .
inwent would retain its 14 regional offices in germany and others maintained with partners throughout the world .
savings will remain in the development budget bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dirk niebel 's plans for reform of germany 's development infrastructure are controversial niebel , a member of germany 's pro-business free democratic party , told german television that the move was completely separate from the federal government 's recently announced cost-cutting measures .
" it 's natural , of course , that with increasingly strained public finance , things must be made more efficient , " niebel said .
niebel said he had talked to the finance minister about allowing the savings from the consolidation to remain within the ministry budget - so that although the ministry would not see any funding increases until 2014 , it would n't see any budget cuts , either .
the plan has been criticized by the opposition social democrats ' spokesperson for development policy , sascha raabe .
raabe told the protestant news service -lrb- epd -rrb- that niebel lacked the courage for the required major reforms , and was instead making cosmetic changes .
" that is not going to help our partners in the world , " raabe said .

dw-world.de german aid minister refuses to ' throw money out the window ' in afghanistan germany has denied afghanistan 's wish for more control over how development money is spent .
the country is still too corrupt to independently distribute the aid budget , said germany 's development minister .
-lrb- 02.04.2010 -rrb- german aid agencies face government shake-up the german government has defended plans to merge the three main state-funded aid agencies , gtz , ded and inwent , into a more efficient organization .
development minister dirk niebel says no job cuts are involved .
-lrb- 08.03.2010 -rrb- germany will miss 2010 development aid target germany 's development minister dirk niebel has said berlin will fail to meet its development aid targets for 2010 .
he also expressed doubt whether germany would be able to increase aid to 0.7 percent of gdp by 2015 .
-lrb- 07.03.2010 -rrb- feedback is the merger of the three agencies a good idea ?

there are a number of teams who may struggle in the group stages but here , deutsche welle takes a look at three teams who may already have their return tickets booked for june 26th when the knock-out stage begins .
north korea the team from the one of the world 's most secretive and repressive states is apparently resorting to type in south africa by keeping its preparations and players under cover .

perhaps north korea are just afraid at showing their group c rivals just how bad they are .
saying that , they are at the world cup for the first time since they famously reached the quarter-finals of the 1966 finals so they ca n't be that bad – can they ?

but after failing to make the finals at any point in the last 44 years and finding themselves in the " group of death " with brazil , portugal and the ivory coast , it does n't matter how good or bad they are , the smart money is on north korea heading home after three games .

while they might not be heading for knock-out stage qualification themselves , their involvement in the tournament may at least dictate who out of their group opponents ' progress .
the minnows from the cinematic middle earth have only featured in one other word cup , in spain in 1982 , when they lost all three matches .

the south should last longer while nobody will admit to arriving at the world cup just to make up the numbers , the realists among the 32 nations competing will know that it 's highly unlikely that they 'll get out of the group stages . no-one can say what will happen at a world cup .
previous form means little in the heat of battle at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
good teams can have bad days and bad teams can have good ones .
but there are certain teams who arrive with barely a shred of hope of getting out of the group stage .
they may make things difficult for their group opponents and maybe pull off a shock on their way out of the competition , but these are the teams who arrive with no expectations and who are just happy to be there .
there are a number of teams who may struggle in the group stages but here , deutsche welle takes a look at three teams who may already have their return tickets booked for june 26th when the knock-out stage begins .
north korea the team from the one of the world 's most secretive and repressive states is apparently resorting to type in south africa by keeping its preparations and players under cover .
journalists are given short shrift , while training sessions - which every other team has opened to the public - are held behind closed doors .
perhaps north korea are just afraid at showing their group c rivals just how bad they are .
saying that , they are at the world cup for the first time since they famously reached the quarter-finals of the 1966 finals so they ca n't be that bad – can they ?
bildunterschrift : let 's hope that the north korean team are as well-drilled and co-ordinated as their supporters qualifying from the asia conference after beating the likes of saudi arabia , jordan and united arab emirates , and holding their own with their more experienced southern neighbors , north korea – known as the chollima , a mythical horse too swift to be mounted – start with a clean slate , just like everyone else at the 2010 world cup .
but after failing to make the finals at any point in the last 44 years and finding themselves in the " group of death " with brazil , portugal and the ivory coast , it does n't matter how good or bad they are , the smart money is on north korea heading home after three games .
the team , ranked 105th in the world , is made up predominantly of players who feature in north korean teams with only a handful playing outside of the ironhanded communist state .
jong tae-se , known as asia 's wayne rooney , and an yong-hak play in japan 's j-league while striker hong yong-jo plays for russia 's fc rostov .
such is the nature of the country 's regime , very little is known about the rest of the team .
new zealand coming from one of the most laid-back countries on earth , the all whites arrive in south africa under no illusions .
faced with a group featuring world champions italy , paraguay and slovakia , the new zealand team accepts that their world cup is likely to end at the group stage .
this will not stop them from giving their all and enjoying the experience to the fullest .
bildunterschrift : the all whites - here in all black - may not be world beaters but they might make it harder for others however , instead of arriving expecting to get thrashed , the all whites are quietly confident that they can at least give their group f opponents a few headaches after a 1-0 friendly victory over serbia and feisty defeats to chile , to whom they lost 2-0 , and a close 2-1 loss to oceania rivals australia .
while they might not be heading for knock-out stage qualification themselves , their involvement in the tournament may at least dictate who out of their group opponents ' progress .
the minnows from the cinematic middle earth have only featured in one other word cup , in spain in 1982 , when they lost all three matches .
much like what is expected from this tournament , the all whites gave a good account of themselves in a difficult group featuring brazil , the soviet union and scotland .
honduras if facing one of the world cup favorites , a plucky european battler , and one of the best teams in south america -lrb- on current form -rrb- is n't bad enough , honduras arrive in south africa without a win to their name since january 's 2-1 victory over the united states .
they recently struggled in a goalless draw with azerbaijan , labored to a 2-2 draw against belarus and also got beaten 3-0 by non-qualifier romania in their final friendly before heading to the world cup .
getting the type of results to beat spain , switzerland and chile to qualify from group h may be a tall order for honduras on current form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavon and co. are already being written off back home there is quality in the side , which features tottenham hotspur midfielder wilson palacios , as well as an experienced strike force made up of david suazo , who plays for genoa in italy 's serie a , and the ageless carlos pavon .
the 36-year-old pavon is closing in on the two-decade mark in a career which has taken him to 15 clubs and counting , in countries as disparate as italy , spain , colombia , and the united states but the team 's confidence wo n't be helped by news from home that the majority of supporters are horrified by their pre-world cup form .
pressure is building on colombian-born coach reinaldo rueda who is accused by many pundits back in honduras of having no idea as to how he wants the team to play .
with spain looking more dangerous than ever , the swiss capable of either genius or farce under ottmar hitzfeld , and high-scoring chile obsessed with fast-tempo attacking play , the best honduras can hope for is a result against switzerland and damage control against the spaniards and chileans before flying home to face their rabid press .

the south should last longer while nobody will admit to arriving at the world cup just to make up the numbers , the realists among the 32 nations competing will know that it 's highly unlikely that they 'll get out of the group stages . no-one can say what will happen at a world cup .
previous form means little in the heat of battle at the world 's biggest soccer tournament .
good teams can have bad days and bad teams can have good ones .
but there are certain teams who arrive with barely a shred of hope of getting out of the group stage .
they may make things difficult for their group opponents and maybe pull off a shock on their way out of the competition , but these are the teams who arrive with no expectations and who are just happy to be there .
there are a number of teams who may struggle in the group stages but here , deutsche welle takes a look at three teams who may already have their return tickets booked for june 26th when the knock-out stage begins .
north korea the team from the one of the world 's most secretive and repressive states is apparently resorting to type in south africa by keeping its preparations and players under cover .
journalists are given short shrift , while training sessions - which every other team has opened to the public - are held behind closed doors .
perhaps north korea are just afraid at showing their group c rivals just how bad they are .
saying that , they are at the world cup for the first time since they famously reached the quarter-finals of the 1966 finals so they ca n't be that bad – can they ?
bildunterschrift : let 's hope that the north korean team are as well-drilled and co-ordinated as their supporters qualifying from the asia conference after beating the likes of saudi arabia , jordan and united arab emirates , and holding their own with their more experienced southern neighbors , north korea – known as the chollima , a mythical horse too swift to be mounted – start with a clean slate , just like everyone else at the 2010 world cup .
but after failing to make the finals at any point in the last 44 years and finding themselves in the " group of death " with brazil , portugal and the ivory coast , it does n't matter how good or bad they are , the smart money is on north korea heading home after three games .
the team , ranked 105th in the world , is made up predominantly of players who feature in north korean teams with only a handful playing outside of the ironhanded communist state .
jong tae-se , known as asia 's wayne rooney , and an yong-hak play in japan 's j-league while striker hong yong-jo plays for russia 's fc rostov .
such is the nature of the country 's regime , very little is known about the rest of the team .
new zealand coming from one of the most laid-back countries on earth , the all whites arrive in south africa under no illusions .
faced with a group featuring world champions italy , paraguay and slovakia , the new zealand team accepts that their world cup is likely to end at the group stage .
this will not stop them from giving their all and enjoying the experience to the fullest .
bildunterschrift : the all whites - here in all black - may not be world beaters but they might make it harder for others however , instead of arriving expecting to get thrashed , the all whites are quietly confident that they can at least give their group f opponents a few headaches after a 1-0 friendly victory over serbia and feisty defeats to chile , to whom they lost 2-0 , and a close 2-1 loss to oceania rivals australia .
while they might not be heading for knock-out stage qualification themselves , their involvement in the tournament may at least dictate who out of their group opponents ' progress .
the minnows from the cinematic middle earth have only featured in one other word cup , in spain in 1982 , when they lost all three matches .
much like what is expected from this tournament , the all whites gave a good account of themselves in a difficult group featuring brazil , the soviet union and scotland .
honduras if facing one of the world cup favorites , a plucky european battler , and one of the best teams in south america -lrb- on current form -rrb- is n't bad enough , honduras arrive in south africa without a win to their name since january 's 2-1 victory over the united states .
they recently struggled in a goalless draw with azerbaijan , labored to a 2-2 draw against belarus and also got beaten 3-0 by non-qualifier romania in their final friendly before heading to the world cup .
getting the type of results to beat spain , switzerland and chile to qualify from group h may be a tall order for honduras on current form .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavon and co. are already being written off back home there is quality in the side , which features tottenham hotspur midfielder wilson palacios , as well as an experienced strike force made up of david suazo , who plays for genoa in italy 's serie a , and the ageless carlos pavon .
the 36-year-old pavon is closing in on the two-decade mark in a career which has taken him to 15 clubs and counting , in countries as disparate as italy , spain , colombia , and the united states but the team 's confidence wo n't be helped by news from home that the majority of supporters are horrified by their pre-world cup form .
pressure is building on colombian-born coach reinaldo rueda who is accused by many pundits back in honduras of having no idea as to how he wants the team to play .
with spain looking more dangerous than ever , the swiss capable of either genius or farce under ottmar hitzfeld , and high-scoring chile obsessed with fast-tempo attacking play , the best honduras can hope for is a result against switzerland and damage control against the spaniards and chileans before flying home to face their rabid press .

advertisement former soldier ben close tells file on 4 's julian o 'halloran about his ptsd by julian o 'halloran bbc file on 4 a government plan to provide more help for mentally ill soldiers has been thrown into doubt weeks after it was announced by the ministry of defence .
the scheme , unveiled by the mod in may , was aimed at early diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder and other conditions affecting combat soldiers .
but a defence minister has told the bbc he opposes screening .
veterans ' charities say the iraq and afghanistan conflicts alone will cause thousands of cases of mental illness .
the ministry of defence said last month it was " committed to creating an effective , through-life , mental health scheme for our service and ex-service personnel " .
screening debate it stressed : " a dedicated programme for those leaving the armed forces will be established to tackle post-combat mental health issues : a new mental health screening service within the armed forces will work to identify problems early on , and for those who need specialist help , we will establish britain 's first dedicated ptsd -lrb- post-traumatic stress disorder -rrb- treatment programme within the nhs . "
the government has promised to care for troops ' mental health however , andrew robathan , minister for personnel , welfare and veterans , told bbc file on 4 : " i think most expert opinion is that you should not screen people for mental health issues because first of all there is no scientifically robust way that you can do that .
" indeed the downside of suggesting that people have mental health problems when actually they do not have , is actually quite immense and of great concern . "
but when this apparent contradiction between this and the mod statement was pointed out he said : " we are certainly looking at all these things but the current advice that we are getting is that it would be ill-advised to go down a programme of screening for the reasons i have stated which is that you can identify all sorts of people having mental health problems which with the best will in the world still has some stigma attached when these people do not have any such problems . "
the mod had been responding to research published last month , from the centre for defence medical health at kings college london , which found that 40 out of 1,000 services personnel were suffering from ptsd with the figure rising to 70 out of 1,000 for those who had served in combat zones .
previously , government data published by the national audit office had stated that the figure was one in 1,000 .
former coldstream guardsman ben close , who has been diagnosed with ptsd , told the bbc he had never been screened .
illness stigma he claimed the only help troops returning from afghanistan was a day and a half in cyprus where a doctor gave a short talk .
if you are mentally ill or in any way ill in the army you are outcasted and that is not good when you are living in close proximity to everyone else ben close , former coldstream guardsman " he says if you feel any sort of symptoms now is the time to talk to me about them which is no good because they do n't kick in till two to three weeks after , " he added .
mr close said ptsd and other mental illnesses carried a stigma in the army .
" if you are mentally ill or in any way ill in the army you are outcasted and that is not good when you are living in close proximity to everyone else , " he added .
the ministry of defence 's mental health expert , surgeon commander neil greenberg , told the bbc : " we have some very strong evidence that stigma within the military does exist but it is at exactly the same level as in the civilian sector and also the same level as is in the forces such as the us . "
he added , " what i can absolutely assure is anyone who is in the armed forces who has a mental health problem and who goes and seeks help , be it from a gp , chaplain or anyone else is that they will get evidence based treatment based on national institute for clinical excellence guidelines . "

the government has promised to care for troops ' mental health however , andrew robathan , minister for personnel , welfare and veterans , told bbc file on 4 : " i think most expert opinion is that you should not screen people for mental health issues because first of all there is no scientifically robust way that you can do that .
" indeed the downside of suggesting that people have mental health problems when actually they do not have , is actually quite immense and of great concern . "
but when this apparent contradiction between this and the mod statement was pointed out he said : " we are certainly looking at all these things but the current advice that we are getting is that it would be ill-advised to go down a programme of screening for the reasons i have stated which is that you can identify all sorts of people having mental health problems which with the best will in the world still has some stigma attached when these people do not have any such problems . "
the mod had been responding to research published last month , from the centre for defence medical health at kings college london , which found that 40 out of 1,000 services personnel were suffering from ptsd with the figure rising to 70 out of 1,000 for those who had served in combat zones .
previously , government data published by the national audit office had stated that the figure was one in 1,000 .
former coldstream guardsman ben close , who has been diagnosed with ptsd , told the bbc he had never been screened .
illness stigma he claimed the only help troops returning from afghanistan was a day and a half in cyprus where a doctor gave a short talk .

mr close said ptsd and other mental illnesses carried a stigma in the army .
" if you are mentally ill or in any way ill in the army you are outcasted and that is not good when you are living in close proximity to everyone else , " he added .
the ministry of defence 's mental health expert , surgeon commander neil greenberg , told the bbc : " we have some very strong evidence that stigma within the military does exist but it is at exactly the same level as in the civilian sector and also the same level as is in the forces such as the us . "
he added , " what i can absolutely assure is anyone who is in the armed forces who has a mental health problem and who goes and seeks help , be it from a gp , chaplain or anyone else is that they will get evidence based treatment based on national institute for clinical excellence guidelines . "
