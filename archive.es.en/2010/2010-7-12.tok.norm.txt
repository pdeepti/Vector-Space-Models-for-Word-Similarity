german interior minister thomas de maiziere said he shut down the frankfurt-based ihh -lrb- internationale humanitaere hilfsorganisation -rrb- , found to have been funding the hamas movement which controls gaza and is on the european union 's terror group blacklist .
the group collected 6.6 million euros -lrb- $ 8.3 million -rrb- in donations for hamas , said de maiziere in a statement , and has now been banned because it abused donors ' good intentions in order to " support a terrorist organization with money supposedly donated for charitable purposes . "

swiss justice minister eveline widmer-schlumpf told reporters at a press conference in bern on monday afternoon that the government was unable to ensure that the extradition request was completely valid and without fault .
the swiss questioned whether polanski had already served the necessary time before leaving the united states in 1978 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polanski had been under house arrest at his chalet in switzerland since november " considering the persisting doubts concerning the presentation of the facts of the case , the request has to be rejected , " widmer-schlumpf said .
" the franco-polish filmmaker will not be extradited to the united states and the measures of restriction on his liberty have been lifted . "
polanski 's lawyer herve temime called the decision " an enormous satisfaction and a great relief after the pain suffered by roman polanski and his family . "
illegal sex charges polanski , now 76 , still faces sentencing for unlawful sex with a minor after a 13-year-old girl claimed in 1977 that he raped her .
he was arrested and briefly served time in prison , but fled to france in 1978 , where he has citizenship and has been living since .
the long-running drama was suddenly revived last september when swiss authorities arrested polanski in zurich as he was attending a film festival .
the following november a swiss court released him on bail as long as he remained under house arrest at his home in the resort town of gstaad .
polanski is known for several films including " chinatown " and the cult-classic " rosemary 's baby . "
in 2003 he won the academy award for his direction of the holocaust-themed " the pianist , " but declined to attend the ceremony in los angeles for fear of being arrested .

the russian energy giant is reportedly offering germany 's rwe a role in its south stream pipeline venture to supply natural gas to europe .
but rwe is already a key member of the rival nabucco project . executives at russian energy giant gazprom have approached german energy concern rwe to discuss the prospect of it joining the russian-led south stream project .
" it was just a preliminary discussion , nothing concrete , " a gazprom source told reuters .
" they are interested in entering the project . "
rwe declined to comment on the talks , saying only that the rival nabucco pipeline " is the best project for rwe at the moment . "
rival pipelines the south stream pipeline is to carry up to 63 billion cubic meters of russian gas a year across the black sea to bulgaria , where it will split into two paths to be built by gazprom jointly with local partners .
by comparison , the 3,300 kilometer nabucco pipleline is planned to have an annual capacity of 31 billion cubic meters .
it will transport central asian gas to europe using a route that leads through turkey , bulgaria , romania , hungary and austria - and bypassing russia .
current partners in the nabucco project are bulgarian energy holding , turkey 's botas , hungary 's mol and romania 's transgaz , in addition to rwe and austrian power company omv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom hopes to dominate the flow of gas to europe gazprom has been talking to other european energy companies about south stream .
it has won over italy 's eni and france 's edf as well as omv , which plans to participate in both pipeline projects .
it is unclear whether or not rwe intends to follow omv and have a foot in both camps . some analysts believe the german company may do just that .
leading partners " rwe and omv are leading partners in the nabucco project , " graham freedman , senior energy analyst with market research and consulting company wood mackenzie in london , told deutsche welle .
" i 'm sure the two are talking together .
they 're probably looking at the potential for each of the projects . "
a decision by rwe to pull out of nabucco and join south stream could severely weaken or even put a complete end to nabucco , freedman warns .
" rwe was brought into the consortium originally as a large aggregator of gas - a big utility based in germany , which is effectively the end point for nabucco , " he said .
" i think -lsb- it -rsb- would deal quite a large blow to nabucco if rwe were to leave the consortium . "
nabucco has been slow to get off the ground , largely due to the venture 's struggles to find a sufficient base of natural gas suppliers .
but the european union is particularly keen to see nabucco become a reality to reduce what it and many of its member states view as a growing dependency on russian natural gas .
today , a quarter of the gas consumed in the eu comes from russia , which is expected to produce more than a third within the next few years .
world 's largest gas reservoir a key driver of that growth is the nord stream pipeline venture , which will transport russian gas through a pipeline passing through russian , finnish , swedish and german waters .
it will connect western european markets to siberia 's shtokmanovskoye field , the world 's largest gas reservoir , among other russian gas fields .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rwe says it is committed to the nabucco pipeline diversification of gas regions and pipelines is important , according to claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research .
and in that context , " nabucco has a key role , " she told deutsche welle .
but kemfert is n't overly surprised by the talks between gazprom and rwe .
" i can understand the companies who would like to go for a safe strategy , and russia is a more safe strategy , " she said .
" nabucco has a lot of uncertainties , " which companies like rwe and omv need to assess .
hedge their bets while european power companies may be tempted to hedge their bets by participating in the two rival pipeline ventures , kemfert warned that supporting both could severely drain management and financial resources .
georg zachmann of the think-tank bruegel is skeptical about both projects .
he warns of a " gas glut " in europe .
the region , he said , is receiving increasing volumes of liquefied natural gas from the middle east .
meanwhile the united states , a big consumer of natural gas , has been importing little or no gas from world markets since it tapped into rich shale gas deposits formed among layers of sedimentary rock .
in the short and mid-term , zachmann said , " everything points in the direction of oversupply in the european market , " raising questions why anyone would want to invest " in a new expensive pipeline through various countries with the aim to discipline the pricing behavior of monopolies . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de transportation -pipe- 12.07.2010 deutsche bahn faces investigation after passengers collapse in heat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several students collapsed on the train bound for cologne the current heat wave could end in legal trouble for german rail operator deutsche bahn .
forty-four passengers needed medical attention after travelling on a high-speed train with a broken air conditioning system . german police are investigating charges against rail operator deutsche bahn after 44 passengers needed medical attention after travelling on a high-speed train with a broken air conditioning system on the weekend .
near-panic broke out on board the ice train from berlin to cologne on saturday when several high-school students returning from a school trip collapsed and lay unconscious and dehydrated in the aisle .
the train was eventually stopped in the central german town of bielefeld .
" people were already collapsing in the train , and four of our students hyperventilated when they stepped out onto the platform , " said distressed teacher dagmar reichenberg-arnoldy , as emergency doctors attended to her class on the platform .
three trains were affected , nine students and elderly passengers ended up in hospital and a pregnant woman tried to smash a window with an emergency hammer in desperation .
with outside temperatures of up to 38 degrees celsius , a broken air-conditioning system and sealed windows , temperatures within reportedly reached up to 50 degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruediger grube promised compensation damage control deutsche bahn 's public relations department quickly attempted some damage control , with boss ruediger grube promising compensation .
spokesman juergen kornmann appealed for the public to put saturday 's events in perspective .
" we operate 1,400 inter-city connections every day , and yesterday we had problems - big problems i admit - on three of the trains , " he said .
" so one can see the vast majority of travelers arrive safely and comfortably . "
but these justifications have not prevented saturday 's events from catching the attention of the police , who announced that they have begun investigations into deutsche bahn on suspicion of causing bodily harm by negligence .
a police spokeswoman said the problem with the air-conditioning had been known well before the train was stopped in bielefeld .
endemic problems ?
meanwhile , passengers on other trains have since come forward to report problems on other trains .
oliver rasche , who was travelling on a stretch from bochum to berlin on saturday , complained about the way deutsche bahn handled the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temperature inside the train was estimated at 50 degrees celsius " there was no official reaction or official announcement at all that the train was damaged or that the air-conditioning was not working , " he said .
" you just realized it was getting hotter and hotter . "
dirty filters , causing the air-conditioning to overheat and shut itself down , have been blamed for the problems , and karl-peter naumann of public transport passenger organization pro bahn believes cost-cutting schemes in deutsche bahn 's maintenance department have caused endemic problems .
" i think that parts relevant to safety - the wheels and the axles - are being cared for very thoroughly , but i 'm afraid that means the air-conditioning system is neglected , " he told german broadcaster ntv .
if saturday 's dramatic events are traced to a lack of maintenance in on-board systems , deutsche bahn could face serious legal trouble .

forty-four passengers needed medical attention after travelling on a high-speed train with a broken air conditioning system . german police are investigating charges against rail operator deutsche bahn after 44 passengers needed medical attention after travelling on a high-speed train with a broken air conditioning system on the weekend .
near-panic broke out on board the ice train from berlin to cologne on saturday when several high-school students returning from a school trip collapsed and lay unconscious and dehydrated in the aisle .
the train was eventually stopped in the central german town of bielefeld .
" people were already collapsing in the train , and four of our students hyperventilated when they stepped out onto the platform , " said distressed teacher dagmar reichenberg-arnoldy , as emergency doctors attended to her class on the platform .
three trains were affected , nine students and elderly passengers ended up in hospital and a pregnant woman tried to smash a window with an emergency hammer in desperation .
with outside temperatures of up to 38 degrees celsius , a broken air-conditioning system and sealed windows , temperatures within reportedly reached up to 50 degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruediger grube promised compensation damage control deutsche bahn 's public relations department quickly attempted some damage control , with boss ruediger grube promising compensation .
spokesman juergen kornmann appealed for the public to put saturday 's events in perspective .
" we operate 1,400 inter-city connections every day , and yesterday we had problems - big problems i admit - on three of the trains , " he said .
" so one can see the vast majority of travelers arrive safely and comfortably . "
but these justifications have not prevented saturday 's events from catching the attention of the police , who announced that they have begun investigations into deutsche bahn on suspicion of causing bodily harm by negligence .
a police spokeswoman said the problem with the air-conditioning had been known well before the train was stopped in bielefeld .
endemic problems ?
meanwhile , passengers on other trains have since come forward to report problems on other trains .
oliver rasche , who was travelling on a stretch from bochum to berlin on saturday , complained about the way deutsche bahn handled the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temperature inside the train was estimated at 50 degrees celsius " there was no official reaction or official announcement at all that the train was damaged or that the air-conditioning was not working , " he said .
" you just realized it was getting hotter and hotter . "
dirty filters , causing the air-conditioning to overheat and shut itself down , have been blamed for the problems , and karl-peter naumann of public transport passenger organization pro bahn believes cost-cutting schemes in deutsche bahn 's maintenance department have caused endemic problems .
" i think that parts relevant to safety - the wheels and the axles - are being cared for very thoroughly , but i 'm afraid that means the air-conditioning system is neglected , " he told german broadcaster ntv .
if saturday 's dramatic events are traced to a lack of maintenance in on-board systems , deutsche bahn could face serious legal trouble .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals spain lifts first world cup , beating the netherlands world cup -pipe- 12.07.2010 youthful germany hold heads high and look to future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german fans flew the flag with pride both in south africa and back home as the german squad arrived home in frankfurt early monday morning , celebrating thomas mueller 's golden boot and a third-place finish , we reflect on the lasting legacy of joachim loew 's young , adventurous team . germany 's national football team revived fond memories of the 2006 world cup with another stirring performance at the 2010 edition of the tournament in south africa on saturday .
the team 's refreshing brand of offensive soccer inspired fans of the sport worldwide and made many rethink the way they perceive not only german football , but also germany itself .
germany repeated its placing from 2006 , the tournament it hosted , by prevailing 3-2 over a determined uruguay team in saturday 's match for third place .
" we 're not going back home to germany empty-handed , but with a third place finish , which the team has earned , " said national team head coach joachim loew , the architect of germany 's 2010 showing .
during the 2006 world cup , germany showed itself as a friendly and cosmopolitan country , and the event was widely regarded as an overwhelming success from both the organizational and entertainment points of view .
this year , the national team earned the world 's respect with its exciting , high-scoring style of football .
" abroad , this team is perceived as being very likeable , " said newly elected german president christian wulff , who flew to south africa to watch his country play uruguay .
" some africans have told me this team is something of a ' rainbow ' team , diverse and convincing , " he said .
the stirring performance has even led to a recommendation by wulff that loew receive the federal cross of merit for service to the nation , and that the team be awarded the silver bay laurel leaf , the highest sports award in germany .
" the team is the best ambassador germany has in the world , " wulff added .
german soccer legend franz beckenbauer also praised the national team .
" the mood in south africa was euphoric , and many people have told me that the german team has been the best , " he said .
national team manager and former striker oliver bierhoff gleaned a similarly positive message from the tournament .
" we have managed to create a new picture of germany , not only in a sporting sense , but also socially , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany 's young , multicultural squad celebrated a second consecutive third place finish youthful team shines without ballack the sense of just how much bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm , thomas mueller and co. have changed the way germany is perceived can not be overstated .
no longer will there be comparisons between the national team and tanks , but rather respect and recognition for what was regarded as a thrilling and youthful way of playing football .
" in my opinion this is the best team with the most quality of all the national teams i 've played on up until now , " said lahm , who was given the captain 's armband for the tournament in the absence of the injured michael ballack .
the loss of ballack , germany 's lone yet aging superstar , caused a lot of stress among german fans in the weeks leading up to the world cup .
but the absence of the new bayer leverkusen midfielder turned out to be an opportunity for the national team to reinvent itself .
ballack said he was watching with amazement as his young countrymen put in some memorable performances in south africa , particularly the 4-0 thrashing of diego maradona 's argentina .
" it 's scary that such a young team could take a classy team like argentina , " he said .
goals galore germany also put in great performances against australia , england and uruguay , though group stage games against serbia and ghana left a little to be desired .
the team finished with a goal tally of 16 over seven games , having conceded five .
what 's more , mueller , 20 , picked up the golden boot award with five of those goals and three assists .
mueller also took the award for best young player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semifinal disappointment soon turned to third-place pride for german fans after slotting home eight goals in two games against england and argentina , many pundits were tipping germany to go all the way , but the eventual champions spain proved an insurmountable obstacle .
the swedish newspaper aftonbladet summed up germany 's 1-0 semifinal loss to la furia roja with this comment : " an attractive , young germany required two years -lrb- from the euro 2008 loss to spain -rrb- to rehearse its own variation of spectacular spanish football .
spain needed 90 minutes to show that the germans are not yet the finished product . "
this was a point touched on by schweinsteiger , who himself had an excellent world cup as assistant captain : " we have many young players , who have a big future ahead of them .
they have now gathered a lot of experience from their first tournament .
that is good for future tournaments . "
in addition to being young and relatively unknown outside of germany , the team has also been the subject of much attention due to its multicultural makeup .
eleven of the 23 players on the world cup squad , including mesut oezil , sami khedira and jerome boateng , have roots overseas .
bundesliga in focus with their strong performances in south africa , the german players have boosted their transfer values and fueled the rumor mill .
no day of the world cup went by without players being linked with europe 's top clubs .
mesut oezil in particular is hot property .
five clubs - fc barcelona , manchester city , manchester united , fc valencia and fc arsenal - have apparently expressed interest in securing the playmaker 's transfer from werder bremen .
schweinsteiger hopes , however , that the dazzling performances of the bundesliga players will have the reverse effect .
" we have done the bundesliga proud .
in the future , the biggest players will come to germany , " the midfielder speculated .
loew 's future still uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and his assistant hansi flick 's lucky sweaters took the side far even though a fourth world cup title ultimately eluded germany , loew earned brownie points as the architect of german football 's renaissance in the world 's eyes .
theo zwanziger , president of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , wants to keep the national coach in the job .
" you can trust that i will do everything in my power to make sure that the coaching staff can take this team into the future , " he said .
yet the coach himself has kept a low profile so far .
it still apparently frustrates him that contract talks with the dfb broke down before the tournament .
" after the world cup , i need two or three days to get my thoughts in order .
and then i will certainly have several ideas and visions on how to go on further , " loew said .
he already has the next goal clearly in his sights .
by the 2012 european championship in poland and ukraine , or at the latest at the 2014 world cup in brazil , he wants to win a title .
philipp lahm is also confident about success in the future .
" as you have already seen at past tournaments , we are always in the running for the title , " he said .

the trial was fiercely criticized by human rights activists .
art expert andrei yerofeyev and former museum director yury samodurov had set up the forbidden art exhibition at the andrei sakharov museum of moscow in 2007 , a museum devoted to the former soviet dissident and nobel peace prize winner who died in 1989 .

the show included a depiction of jesus christ with a mickey mouse head and a spoof coca-cola ad carrying the slogan , " this is my blood . "
the exhibition was condemned by the russian orthodox church .
an ultra-nationalist orthodox group filed a complaint , and prosecutors opened an investigation into the show .
the two men were subsequently charged with inciting religious hatred .

but to win the ever-elusive big one , the spaniards had to change their style . spain 's ugly 1-0 triumph over the netherlands in johannesburg on sunday was a match most neutral football fans will want to forget as soon as possible .
but the way the spanish claimed the title is truly memorable .
spain scored only eight goals in seven matches , winning each of their four knock-out stage games by a score of 1-0 and setting a new record for the fewest tallies ever by a winner .
to put the numbers in perspective : all previous teams that lifted the trophy scored at least 11 goals .
and in this tournament , third-placed germany found the back of the net twice as often as the spaniards .
indeed , the netherlands , argentina , brazil and even uruguay were more potent offensively than coach vicente del bosque 's men .
with so many of their games coming down to the wire , luck clearly played a role in spain 's first-ever world cup triumph .
but was it accidental ?
not at all .
squad with a flaw bildunterschrift : torres was unable to make a meaningful contribution spain rightly rolled into south africa as one of the pre-tournament favorites .
they were the reigning european champions , having scored 12 goals in 6 matches on their way to the 2008 title and being blessed with a starting midfield drawn exclusively from powerhouses barcelona and real madrid .
but the squad contained a potentially fatal flaw .
striker fernando torres , who was coming off knee surgery , proved to be a shadow of his normal self , rarely capable of getting behind defenses and unable to turn on the ball when he did .
that essentially left spain without an effective center forward , a crucial element in what had been the squad 's free-flowing attack .
the spanish survived the group stage , thanks largely to striker david villa 's individual brilliance , but at that point many people were writing them off .
there was no question that the midfield , anchored by the exceptional xavi and iniesta , would dominate possession and frustrate opponents with their short passing .
but how could spain win if there was no one big up front to serve as a target man ?
strategic adjustment bildunterschrift : villa came up huge the answer lay in a clever , if unorthodox tactical change .
del bosque went even smaller .
villa - whose official height is listed at 1.75 meters -lrb- 5 ' 9 " -rrb- - replaced torres in the middle , while the hole in the squad was filled by diminutive wingers pedro and jesus navas .
the result was something that oddly resembled an italian catenaccio .
spain were n't packing it in at the back , however , as much as they were playing keep-away just inside their opponents ' half .
that made spain less incisive going forward - villa scored the last of his 5 goals -lrb- putting away a rebound off the goalpost -rrb- in the spaniards ' quarterfinal against paraguay .
but the adjustment also put the focus of spain 's remaining matches even more squarely on the midfield , where del bosque had his biggest advantage .
germany and the netherlands ran themselves ragged trying to win the ball back , while spain waited and waited for gaps to open up .
boring , a lot of football fans thought .
but effective .
in every one of their games , spain not only had more possession , but more shots on target than their opponents .
the end of national styles bildunterschrift : xavi , xabi alonso and iniesta anchored a superlative midfield one thing that this world cup made clear in that cliches about how various national teams play the game are in need of serious revision .
historically , spain were always a team that scored a lot and did n't get very far in the world cup .
the spanish teams of 1986 , 1994 and 2002 were twice as productive offensively than the 2010 squad - all were knocked out in the quarterfinals .
the current , more tactically disciplined team is built around an axis of players from barcelona , a club that was for the better part of 11 years -lrb- 1997-2008 -rrb- coached by two dutchmen , louis van gaal and frank rijkaard .
and it was n't just spain that defied stereotypes .
the most attractive offensive team in south africa , germany , featured seven field players from bayern munich , which is now of course coached by van gaal .
conversely , the netherlands came very close to taking this year 's title by abandoning " total football " for a rough-and-tumble style reminiscent of german teams of the past .
their coach bert van marwijk spent two-and-a-half years at bundesliga club borussia dortmund , and the embodiment of the new " tough dutch " style , defensive midfielder mark van bommel , is a barcelona veteran and current mainstay at bayern .
twenty years ago , it would have been unthinkable for the dutch and spanish to sacrifice the beautiful aspect of the beautiful game for results - or that germany would take spectators breaths away with technical acumen and inspiration .
but in the modern , internationalized game , anything is possible .
and that 's a key reason why the former perennial underachievers , spain , hoisted their first world cup trophy on sunday .

the current , more tactically disciplined team is built around an axis of players from barcelona , a club that was for the better part of 11 years -lrb- 1997-2008 -rrb- coached by two dutchmen , louis van gaal and frank rijkaard .
and it was n't just spain that defied stereotypes .
the most attractive offensive team in south africa , germany , featured seven field players from bayern munich , which is now of course coached by van gaal .
conversely , the netherlands came very close to taking this year 's title by abandoning " total football " for a rough-and-tumble style reminiscent of german teams of the past .
their coach bert van marwijk spent two-and-a-half years at bundesliga club borussia dortmund , and the embodiment of the new " tough dutch " style , defensive midfielder mark van bommel , is a barcelona veteran and current mainstay at bayern .
twenty years ago , it would have been unthinkable for the dutch and spanish to sacrifice the beautiful aspect of the beautiful game for results - or that germany would take spectators breaths away with technical acumen and inspiration .
but in the modern , internationalized game , anything is possible .
and that 's a key reason why the former perennial underachievers , spain , hoisted their first world cup trophy on sunday .

but the way the spanish claimed the title is truly memorable .
spain scored only eight goals in seven matches , winning each of their four knock-out stage games by a score of 1-0 and setting a new record for the fewest tallies ever by a winner .
to put the numbers in perspective : all previous teams that lifted the trophy scored at least 11 goals .
and in this tournament , third-placed germany found the back of the net twice as often as the spaniards .

they were the reigning european champions , having scored 12 goals in 6 matches on their way to the 2008 title and being blessed with a starting midfield drawn exclusively from powerhouses barcelona and real madrid .
but the squad contained a potentially fatal flaw .
striker fernando torres , who was coming off knee surgery , proved to be a shadow of his normal self , rarely capable of getting behind defenses and unable to turn on the ball when he did .
that essentially left spain without an effective center forward , a crucial element in what had been the squad 's free-flowing attack .
the spanish survived the group stage , thanks largely to striker david villa 's individual brilliance , but at that point many people were writing them off .
there was no question that the midfield , anchored by the exceptional xavi and iniesta , would dominate possession and frustrate opponents with their short passing .
but how could spain win if there was no one big up front to serve as a target man ?
strategic adjustment bildunterschrift : villa came up huge the answer lay in a clever , if unorthodox tactical change .
del bosque went even smaller .
villa - whose official height is listed at 1.75 meters -lrb- 5 ' 9 " -rrb- - replaced torres in the middle , while the hole in the squad was filled by diminutive wingers pedro and jesus navas .
the result was something that oddly resembled an italian catenaccio .
spain were n't packing it in at the back , however , as much as they were playing keep-away just inside their opponents ' half .
that made spain less incisive going forward - villa scored the last of his 5 goals -lrb- putting away a rebound off the goalpost -rrb- in the spaniards ' quarterfinal against paraguay .
but the adjustment also put the focus of spain 's remaining matches even more squarely on the midfield , where del bosque had his biggest advantage .
germany and the netherlands ran themselves ragged trying to win the ball back , while spain waited and waited for gaps to open up .

but to win the ever-elusive big one , the spaniards had to change their style . spain 's ugly 1-0 triumph over the netherlands in johannesburg on sunday was a match most neutral football fans will want to forget as soon as possible .
but the way the spanish claimed the title is truly memorable .
spain scored only eight goals in seven matches , winning each of their four knock-out stage games by a score of 1-0 and setting a new record for the fewest tallies ever by a winner .
to put the numbers in perspective : all previous teams that lifted the trophy scored at least 11 goals .
and in this tournament , third-placed germany found the back of the net twice as often as the spaniards .
indeed , the netherlands , argentina , brazil and even uruguay were more potent offensively than coach vicente del bosque 's men .
with so many of their games coming down to the wire , luck clearly played a role in spain 's first-ever world cup triumph .
but was it accidental ?
not at all .
squad with a flaw bildunterschrift : torres was unable to make a meaningful contribution spain rightly rolled into south africa as one of the pre-tournament favorites .
they were the reigning european champions , having scored 12 goals in 6 matches on their way to the 2008 title and being blessed with a starting midfield drawn exclusively from powerhouses barcelona and real madrid .
but the squad contained a potentially fatal flaw .
striker fernando torres , who was coming off knee surgery , proved to be a shadow of his normal self , rarely capable of getting behind defenses and unable to turn on the ball when he did .
that essentially left spain without an effective center forward , a crucial element in what had been the squad 's free-flowing attack .
the spanish survived the group stage , thanks largely to striker david villa 's individual brilliance , but at that point many people were writing them off .
there was no question that the midfield , anchored by the exceptional xavi and iniesta , would dominate possession and frustrate opponents with their short passing .
but how could spain win if there was no one big up front to serve as a target man ?
strategic adjustment bildunterschrift : villa came up huge the answer lay in a clever , if unorthodox tactical change .
del bosque went even smaller .
villa - whose official height is listed at 1.75 meters -lrb- 5 ' 9 " -rrb- - replaced torres in the middle , while the hole in the squad was filled by diminutive wingers pedro and jesus navas .
the result was something that oddly resembled an italian catenaccio .
spain were n't packing it in at the back , however , as much as they were playing keep-away just inside their opponents ' half .
that made spain less incisive going forward - villa scored the last of his 5 goals -lrb- putting away a rebound off the goalpost -rrb- in the spaniards ' quarterfinal against paraguay .
but the adjustment also put the focus of spain 's remaining matches even more squarely on the midfield , where del bosque had his biggest advantage .
germany and the netherlands ran themselves ragged trying to win the ball back , while spain waited and waited for gaps to open up .
boring , a lot of football fans thought .
but effective .
in every one of their games , spain not only had more possession , but more shots on target than their opponents .
the end of national styles bildunterschrift : xavi , xabi alonso and iniesta anchored a superlative midfield one thing that this world cup made clear in that cliches about how various national teams play the game are in need of serious revision .
historically , spain were always a team that scored a lot and did n't get very far in the world cup .
the spanish teams of 1986 , 1994 and 2002 were twice as productive offensively than the 2010 squad - all were knocked out in the quarterfinals .
the current , more tactically disciplined team is built around an axis of players from barcelona , a club that was for the better part of 11 years -lrb- 1997-2008 -rrb- coached by two dutchmen , louis van gaal and frank rijkaard .
and it was n't just spain that defied stereotypes .
the most attractive offensive team in south africa , germany , featured seven field players from bayern munich , which is now of course coached by van gaal .
conversely , the netherlands came very close to taking this year 's title by abandoning " total football " for a rough-and-tumble style reminiscent of german teams of the past .
their coach bert van marwijk spent two-and-a-half years at bundesliga club borussia dortmund , and the embodiment of the new " tough dutch " style , defensive midfielder mark van bommel , is a barcelona veteran and current mainstay at bayern .
twenty years ago , it would have been unthinkable for the dutch and spanish to sacrifice the beautiful aspect of the beautiful game for results - or that germany would take spectators breaths away with technical acumen and inspiration .
but in the modern , internationalized game , anything is possible .
and that 's a key reason why the former perennial underachievers , spain , hoisted their first world cup trophy on sunday .

the team 's refreshing brand of offensive soccer inspired fans of the sport worldwide and made many rethink the way they perceive not only german football , but also germany itself .
germany repeated its placing from 2006 , the tournament it hosted , by prevailing 3-2 over a determined uruguay team in saturday 's match for third place .
" we 're not going back home to germany empty-handed , but with a third place finish , which the team has earned , " said national team head coach joachim loew , the architect of germany 's 2010 showing .
during the 2006 world cup , germany showed itself as a friendly and cosmopolitan country , and the event was widely regarded as an overwhelming success from both the organizational and entertainment points of view .
this year , the national team earned the world 's respect with its exciting , high-scoring style of football .
" abroad , this team is perceived as being very likeable , " said newly elected german president christian wulff , who flew to south africa to watch his country play uruguay .
" some africans have told me this team is something of a ' rainbow ' team , diverse and convincing , " he said .
the stirring performance has even led to a recommendation by wulff that loew receive the federal cross of merit for service to the nation , and that the team be awarded the silver bay laurel leaf , the highest sports award in germany .
" the team is the best ambassador germany has in the world , " wulff added .
german soccer legend franz beckenbauer also praised the national team .
" the mood in south africa was euphoric , and many people have told me that the german team has been the best , " he said .
national team manager and former striker oliver bierhoff gleaned a similarly positive message from the tournament .
" we have managed to create a new picture of germany , not only in a sporting sense , but also socially , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany 's young , multicultural squad celebrated a second consecutive third place finish youthful team shines without ballack the sense of just how much bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm , thomas mueller and co. have changed the way germany is perceived can not be overstated .
no longer will there be comparisons between the national team and tanks , but rather respect and recognition for what was regarded as a thrilling and youthful way of playing football .
" in my opinion this is the best team with the most quality of all the national teams i 've played on up until now , " said lahm , who was given the captain 's armband for the tournament in the absence of the injured michael ballack .
the loss of ballack , germany 's lone yet aging superstar , caused a lot of stress among german fans in the weeks leading up to the world cup .
but the absence of the new bayer leverkusen midfielder turned out to be an opportunity for the national team to reinvent itself .
ballack said he was watching with amazement as his young countrymen put in some memorable performances in south africa , particularly the 4-0 thrashing of diego maradona 's argentina .
" it 's scary that such a young team could take a classy team like argentina , " he said .
goals galore germany also put in great performances against australia , england and uruguay , though group stage games against serbia and ghana left a little to be desired .
the team finished with a goal tally of 16 over seven games , having conceded five .
what 's more , mueller , 20 , picked up the golden boot award with five of those goals and three assists .
mueller also took the award for best young player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semifinal disappointment soon turned to third-place pride for german fans after slotting home eight goals in two games against england and argentina , many pundits were tipping germany to go all the way , but the eventual champions spain proved an insurmountable obstacle .
the swedish newspaper aftonbladet summed up germany 's 1-0 semifinal loss to la furia roja with this comment : " an attractive , young germany required two years -lrb- from the euro 2008 loss to spain -rrb- to rehearse its own variation of spectacular spanish football .
spain needed 90 minutes to show that the germans are not yet the finished product . "
this was a point touched on by schweinsteiger , who himself had an excellent world cup as assistant captain : " we have many young players , who have a big future ahead of them .
they have now gathered a lot of experience from their first tournament .
that is good for future tournaments . "
in addition to being young and relatively unknown outside of germany , the team has also been the subject of much attention due to its multicultural makeup .
eleven of the 23 players on the world cup squad , including mesut oezil , sami khedira and jerome boateng , have roots overseas .
bundesliga in focus with their strong performances in south africa , the german players have boosted their transfer values and fueled the rumor mill .
no day of the world cup went by without players being linked with europe 's top clubs .
mesut oezil in particular is hot property .
five clubs - fc barcelona , manchester city , manchester united , fc valencia and fc arsenal - have apparently expressed interest in securing the playmaker 's transfer from werder bremen .
schweinsteiger hopes , however , that the dazzling performances of the bundesliga players will have the reverse effect .
" we have done the bundesliga proud .
in the future , the biggest players will come to germany , " the midfielder speculated .
loew 's future still uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and his assistant hansi flick 's lucky sweaters took the side far even though a fourth world cup title ultimately eluded germany , loew earned brownie points as the architect of german football 's renaissance in the world 's eyes .
theo zwanziger , president of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , wants to keep the national coach in the job .
" you can trust that i will do everything in my power to make sure that the coaching staff can take this team into the future , " he said .
yet the coach himself has kept a low profile so far .
it still apparently frustrates him that contract talks with the dfb broke down before the tournament .
" after the world cup , i need two or three days to get my thoughts in order .
and then i will certainly have several ideas and visions on how to go on further , " loew said .
he already has the next goal clearly in his sights .
by the 2012 european championship in poland and ukraine , or at the latest at the 2014 world cup in brazil , he wants to win a title .
philipp lahm is also confident about success in the future .
" as you have already seen at past tournaments , we are always in the running for the title , " he said .

but in a televised interview on monday , he staunchly defended himself and his allies . appearing in an interview on national television monday night , french president nicolas sarkozy defended his scandal-stricken minister of labor and social affairs eric woerth and called for a conflict of interest inquiry to put to rest the criticism that has ensued .
" eric woerth is an honest man , a competent man , " sarkozy told france 2 television .
" he enjoys my full confidence . "
sarkozy has been hit by a campaign finance scandal surrounding woerth , in which a former accountant of billionaire l 'oreal heiress liliane bettencourt accused him of accepting an illegal 150,000 euro -lrb- $ 190,000 -rrb- donation for sarkozy 's election campaign in 2007 .
the accountant also accused bettencourt and her late husband of making several other illegal donations to conservative politicians .
in the interview , sarkozy claimed that the scandal was timed to weaken his government as it prepares to embark on an ambitious and controversial reform of the nation 's pension scheme , which woerth is charged with leading .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woerth is in charge of the government 's unpopular pension reform sarkozy said he had asked woerth to step down as treasurer of his ruling ump party , but that woerth would continue his leadership in the pension reform , which involves raising the retirement age from 60 to 62 .
broad span of scandal woerth 's wife has also been caught up in the scandal .
she had worked as a wealth manager for bettencourt , raising questions of a conflict of interest , but quit after secretly taped conversations last month apparently revealed bettencourt 's plans to evade taxes .
federal investigators on sunday cleared woerth of any involvement in the tax evasion scandal , but made no mention of the alleged illegal campaign donation .
just hours before sarkozy 's address , police searched the home of 87-year-old bettencourt , france 's richest woman , in search of evidence in the scandal .
they also searched the home of photographer francois-marie banier , whom bettencourt 's daughter has accused of taking advantage of the heiress ' frailty by taking gifts worth 1 billion euros .

without naming specific military officers , retired general giora eiland told reporters in tel aviv on monday that " mistakes were made in the various decisions taken , including within relatively senior ranks , which contributed to the result not being as we would have wished . "
eiland led an internal investigation into the may 31 raid of a turkish-owned flotilla carrying aid supplies to the gaza strip , which israel has largely sealed off because it is controlled by the radical islamist and anti-israel group hamas .
passengers of the boat attacked the israeli soldiers as they landed , and the soldiers opened fire on the crowd , killing eight turkish citizens and one turkish-american dual citizen .

the committee also found evidence of poor information sharing between various state intelligence agencies , and that the navy had underestimated the threat of violence by the activists on board the ship .

as santos prepares to take over from out-going president álvaro uribe on august 7 , his and his predecessor 's names are expected to feature in hearings at the un human rights council this month on allegations relating to their roles in the illegal killings of civilians .
while serving in the uribe administration as defense minister between 2006 and 2009 , santos was in charge of the military at a time when the colombian army 's alleged policy of murdering civilians in so-called " false positive " killings was at its height .
it is alleged that army units killed civilians to artificially increase the number of combat fatalities in battles against rebel group the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- .
santos was responsible for coordinating uribe 's mission to eradicate colombia of farc and restore security to one of the most violent countries in the world .
the military operation forced farc out of the cities into remote jungle areas , radically reduced the number of killings and kidnappings in urban areas and rescued colombia from becoming a failed state .
the success of uribe 's mission cemented his popularity and created his reputation among many as the man who saved colombia .
missing civilians linked to expanding war on farc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian troops are accused of killing civilians as farc rebels however , human rights campaigners and international investigators were first alerted to a dark by-product of uribe 's campaign by accusations from families of missing men who claimed that the massive gains the colombian military were making against farc were being boosted by the " false positive " killings of innocent civilians .
the allegations and subsequent investigations led to the removal of the chief of the colombian military and 27 of his officers but santos was spared .
the colombian government has since taken further steps to prevent such killings but , according to un statistics , up to 98.5 percent remain unpunished .
santos continues to claim the killings were the acts of individual soldiers and units and were not sanctioned by the defense ministry .
un investigators remain unconvinced .
" there have been too many killings of a similar nature to characterize them as isolated incidents carried out by individual rogue soldiers or units , or ' bad apples ' , " philip alston , the un 's special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings wrote in a report presented to the un human rights council on june 3 .
" soldiers simply knew that they could get away with murder . "
poor people executed as rebels to boost casualty figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all farc deaths were rebel victims one of the cases being investigated focuses on soacha , a poor suburb of the capital bogotá , and the town of ocaña some 600 kilometers -lrb- 372 miles -rrb- away .
in 2008 , it is alleged that dozens of young men were lured from soacha by paramilitaries and criminals promising employment in ocaña .
once there , they were allegedly sold to colombian army units which executed them as farc guerrillas .
their bodies were then supposedly clothed in military fatigues and draped with weapons and equipment .
the dead were then claimed to be rebel casualties in uribe 's fight against farc .
for the families , this made no sense .
how could the men of soacha , most unable to read or write , others with mental disabilities , transform themselves into uniformed , armed guerrillas ready to take on the battle-hardened colombian military , just days after leaving home ?
" the doctor and the judge said that my son was killed in combat at 2.45am on march 5 , " one mother told deutsche welle .
" his corpse was clothed in camouflage and boots - completely different clothes from what he was wearing when he left . " " the investigations must examine everything , because this can not continue like this , " another anonymous mother from soacha told deutsche welle .
" we will not rest .
this must not go unpunished , although i know that colombia is the land of impunity . " this is just one of the approximately 1,300 cases being examined by investigators from the public prosecutor 's office which suspect military personnel of murdering civilians and claiming they were guerrillas killed in combat in order to win bonuses of up to € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,890 -rrb- per victim .
human rights campaigners suggest that over 2,000 young men were killed and buried in common graves as part of this policy . it is alleged that the kill bonus for units reporting higher enemy body counts , introduced by uribe 's administration in 2005 as part of its intensifying offensive against farc , contributed to the practise of abducting civilians and executing them as rebels .
the large increase of civilian disappearances in colombia can be traced back to this time . former leader claims the ends justified the means in the past , uribe has defended his government 's use of all necessary force to combat farc , saying that the country is safer than ever now due to his crackdown .
his opponents reject his argument that the ends justify the means . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uribe said that the force used to rout farc was justified " the reasoning of the government is completely worn out in my opinion and santos must find alternatives , " camilo gonzalez pozo , director of the colombian institute for the study of development and peace , told deutsche welle .
" the war against farc was the basis for all uribe 's government decisions .
if there was unemployment , farc was to blame for it .
if there were ' false positives ' then farc was to blame for it .
if there were paramilitaries , then farc was to blame for it .
all these arguments have worn themselves out . " with santos unlikely to swerve from uribe 's course of hunting and destroying farc rebels in the jungles of colombia once he becomes president , the memories of what happened in the early years of the operation are unlikely to dissipate .

without naming specific military officers , retired general giora eiland told reporters in tel aviv on monday that " mistakes were made in the various decisions taken , including within relatively senior ranks , which contributed to the result not being as we would have wished . "
eiland led an internal investigation into the may 31 raid of a turkish-owned flotilla carrying aid supplies to the gaza strip , which israel has largely sealed off because it is controlled by the radical islamist and anti-israel group hamas .
passengers of the boat attacked the israeli soldiers as they landed , and the soldiers opened fire on the crowd , killing eight turkish citizens and one turkish-american dual citizen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raid occurred off the gaza strip in international waters the eiland committee was israel 's response to a global backlash against israel and calls for an international probe .
israel decided to conduct its own investigation instead .
intelligence errors despite its admission of mistakes , the investigation cleared the commandos who conducted the raid of any wrongdoing and said their use of live fire was " justified " because their lives were in danger .
chief of staff gabi ashkenazi said in a statement that the probe found no evidence of " negligence . "
" neither i nor the investigating team detected any omission or negligence , but certainly , in an investigation as thorough as this , errors were found which must be corrected in the future , " he said .
the committee also found evidence of poor information sharing between various state intelligence agencies , and that the navy had underestimated the threat of violence by the activists on board the ship .

the team 's refreshing brand of offensive soccer inspired fans of the sport worldwide and made many rethink the way they perceive not only german football , but also germany itself .
germany repeated its placing from 2006 , the tournament it hosted , by prevailing 3-2 over a determined uruguay team in saturday 's match for third place .
" we 're not going back home to germany empty-handed , but with a third place finish , which the team has earned , " said national team head coach joachim loew , the architect of germany 's 2010 showing .
during the 2006 world cup , germany showed itself as a friendly and cosmopolitan country , and the event was widely regarded as an overwhelming success from both the organizational and entertainment points of view .
this year , the national team earned the world 's respect with its exciting , high-scoring style of football .
" abroad , this team is perceived as being very likeable , " said newly elected german president christian wulff , who flew to south africa to watch his country play uruguay .
" some africans have told me this team is something of a ' rainbow ' team , diverse and convincing , " he said .
the stirring performance has even led to a recommendation by wulff that loew receive the federal cross of merit for service to the nation , and that the team be awarded the silver bay laurel leaf , the highest sports award in germany .
" the team is the best ambassador germany has in the world , " wulff added .
german soccer legend franz beckenbauer also praised the national team .
" the mood in south africa was euphoric , and many people have told me that the german team has been the best , " he said .
national team manager and former striker oliver bierhoff gleaned a similarly positive message from the tournament .
" we have managed to create a new picture of germany , not only in a sporting sense , but also socially , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany 's young , multicultural squad celebrated a second consecutive third place finish youthful team shines without ballack the sense of just how much bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm , thomas mueller and co. have changed the way germany is perceived can not be overstated .
no longer will there be comparisons between the national team and tanks , but rather respect and recognition for what was regarded as a thrilling and youthful way of playing football .
" in my opinion this is the best team with the most quality of all the national teams i 've played on up until now , " said lahm , who was given the captain 's armband for the tournament in the absence of the injured michael ballack .
the loss of ballack , germany 's lone yet aging superstar , caused a lot of stress among german fans in the weeks leading up to the world cup .
but the absence of the new bayer leverkusen midfielder turned out to be an opportunity for the national team to reinvent itself .
ballack said he was watching with amazement as his young countrymen put in some memorable performances in south africa , particularly the 4-0 thrashing of diego maradona 's argentina .
" it 's scary that such a young team could take a classy team like argentina , " he said .
goals galore germany also put in great performances against australia , england and uruguay , though group stage games against serbia and ghana left a little to be desired .
the team finished with a goal tally of 16 over seven games , having conceded five .
what 's more , mueller , 20 , picked up the golden boot award with five of those goals and three assists .
mueller also took the award for best young player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semifinal disappointment soon turned to third-place pride for german fans after slotting home eight goals in two games against england and argentina , many pundits were tipping germany to go all the way , but the eventual champions spain proved an insurmountable obstacle .
the swedish newspaper aftonbladet summed up germany 's 1-0 semifinal loss to la furia roja with this comment : " an attractive , young germany required two years -lrb- from the euro 2008 loss to spain -rrb- to rehearse its own variation of spectacular spanish football .
spain needed 90 minutes to show that the germans are not yet the finished product . "
this was a point touched on by schweinsteiger , who himself had an excellent world cup as assistant captain : " we have many young players , who have a big future ahead of them .
they have now gathered a lot of experience from their first tournament .
that is good for future tournaments . "
in addition to being young and relatively unknown outside of germany , the team has also been the subject of much attention due to its multicultural makeup .
eleven of the 23 players on the world cup squad , including mesut oezil , sami khedira and jerome boateng , have roots overseas .
bundesliga in focus with their strong performances in south africa , the german players have boosted their transfer values and fueled the rumor mill .
no day of the world cup went by without players being linked with europe 's top clubs .
mesut oezil in particular is hot property .
five clubs - fc barcelona , manchester city , manchester united , fc valencia and fc arsenal - have apparently expressed interest in securing the playmaker 's transfer from werder bremen .
schweinsteiger hopes , however , that the dazzling performances of the bundesliga players will have the reverse effect .
" we have done the bundesliga proud .
in the future , the biggest players will come to germany , " the midfielder speculated .
loew 's future still uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and his assistant hansi flick 's lucky sweaters took the side far even though a fourth world cup title ultimately eluded germany , loew earned brownie points as the architect of german football 's renaissance in the world 's eyes .
theo zwanziger , president of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , wants to keep the national coach in the job .
" you can trust that i will do everything in my power to make sure that the coaching staff can take this team into the future , " he said .

the team 's refreshing brand of offensive soccer inspired fans of the sport worldwide and made many rethink the way they perceive not only german football , but also germany itself .
germany repeated its placing from 2006 , the tournament it hosted , by prevailing 3-2 over a determined uruguay team in saturday 's match for third place .
" we 're not going back home to germany empty-handed , but with a third place finish , which the team has earned , " said national team head coach joachim loew , the architect of germany 's 2010 showing .
during the 2006 world cup , germany showed itself as a friendly and cosmopolitan country , and the event was widely regarded as an overwhelming success from both the organizational and entertainment points of view .
this year , the national team earned the world 's respect with its exciting , high-scoring style of football .
" abroad , this team is perceived as being very likeable , " said newly elected german president christian wulff , who flew to south africa to watch his country play uruguay .
" some africans have told me this team is something of a ' rainbow ' team , diverse and convincing , " he said .
the stirring performance has even led to a recommendation by wulff that loew receive the federal cross of merit for service to the nation , and that the team be awarded the silver bay laurel leaf , the highest sports award in germany .
" the team is the best ambassador germany has in the world , " wulff added .
german soccer legend franz beckenbauer also praised the national team .
" the mood in south africa was euphoric , and many people have told me that the german team has been the best , " he said .
national team manager and former striker oliver bierhoff gleaned a similarly positive message from the tournament .
" we have managed to create a new picture of germany , not only in a sporting sense , but also socially , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany 's young , multicultural squad celebrated a second consecutive third place finish youthful team shines without ballack the sense of just how much bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm , thomas mueller and co. have changed the way germany is perceived can not be overstated .
no longer will there be comparisons between the national team and tanks , but rather respect and recognition for what was regarded as a thrilling and youthful way of playing football .
" in my opinion this is the best team with the most quality of all the national teams i 've played on up until now , " said lahm , who was given the captain 's armband for the tournament in the absence of the injured michael ballack .
the loss of ballack , germany 's lone yet aging superstar , caused a lot of stress among german fans in the weeks leading up to the world cup .
but the absence of the new bayer leverkusen midfielder turned out to be an opportunity for the national team to reinvent itself .
ballack said he was watching with amazement as his young countrymen put in some memorable performances in south africa , particularly the 4-0 thrashing of diego maradona 's argentina .
" it 's scary that such a young team could take a classy team like argentina , " he said .
goals galore germany also put in great performances against australia , england and uruguay , though group stage games against serbia and ghana left a little to be desired .
the team finished with a goal tally of 16 over seven games , having conceded five .
what 's more , mueller , 20 , picked up the golden boot award with five of those goals and three assists .
mueller also took the award for best young player .

the swedish newspaper aftonbladet summed up germany 's 1-0 semifinal loss to la furia roja with this comment : " an attractive , young germany required two years -lrb- from the euro 2008 loss to spain -rrb- to rehearse its own variation of spectacular spanish football .
spain needed 90 minutes to show that the germans are not yet the finished product . "
this was a point touched on by schweinsteiger , who himself had an excellent world cup as assistant captain : " we have many young players , who have a big future ahead of them .
they have now gathered a lot of experience from their first tournament .
that is good for future tournaments . "
in addition to being young and relatively unknown outside of germany , the team has also been the subject of much attention due to its multicultural makeup .

five clubs - fc barcelona , manchester city , manchester united , fc valencia and fc arsenal - have apparently expressed interest in securing the playmaker 's transfer from werder bremen .
schweinsteiger hopes , however , that the dazzling performances of the bundesliga players will have the reverse effect .
" we have done the bundesliga proud .
in the future , the biggest players will come to germany , " the midfielder speculated .

meanwhile , president sarkozy is to appear on tv to try to quell a political funding scandal . french financial investigators have cleared the country 's labor minister , eric woerth , of accusations that he helped the l 'oreal billionaire liliane bettencourt to evade taxes .
the findings came as welcome news for french president nicolas sarkozy , whose government has been rocked in recent weeks by a scandal over political donations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aims to prevent further embarassment for his government france 's general financial inspection office -lrb- igf -rrb- said woerth did not use his powers while serving as budget minister to prevent the tax affairs of bettencourt from being investigated .
" during the period when he was budget minister , woerth did not intervene in the services under his authority to demand , prevent or influence a decision or an inspection affecting mrs. bettencourt , " read a statement issued by the french finance ministry , which presides over the igf , on sunday .
however questions remain about woerth 's role as treasurer of sarkozy 's ump , in alleged illegal donations to the party and his links to bettencourt .
conflict of interest ?
the politician , whose wife worked for a company managing bettencourt 's estate , has been accused of having a conflict of interest .
a former accountant for bettencourt alleged last week that woerth had been given 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 190,000 -rrb- from the 87-year-old heiress as a donation for sarkozy 's presidential campaign in 2007 , a sum far above than the legal limit .
separate investigations have been opened into those allegations , as well as bettencourt 's financial affairs .
sarkozy is to appear on television on monday evening to talk about the scandal for the first time .
the appearance comes as woerth prepares to launch a controversial pensions bill on tuesday , a central plank of sarkozy 's reform agenda ahead of elections in 2012 .

in a new project in the capital city islamabad , rainwater is now being harvested to address the problem . when heavy rain comes down on the roof of the faisal mosque in islamabad , around 3 million liters of water a day run through its drainage pipes .
the biggest mosque in pakistan and south asia is no longer only an inspiration for believers , it has recently become a source of people 's well-being .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drainage pipes laid to collect water sanullah aman is the director general of the islamabad water management wing . " we have a very comprehensive plan , that no water should be wasted .
we want to save and conserve the water for our future .
and for that we have planned rain harvesting .
we have started a pilot project at the faisal mosque and till now we have been very successful . "
while monitoring wells throughout islamabad over the past two decades , it has been found that the groundwater level has been falling every year by one or two meters .
so the pakistan government in collaboration with the united nations develpoment programme , undp initiated the pilot project at the faisal mosque to harvest the rain water .
abdul majeed from pakistan council of research in water resources says , " i installed this project just a few weeks back .
the salient feature of this project is that i have installed two bore holes .
they are just acting like tube wells .
we pump the water in the tube wells but in these bore holes we are letting the water flow through gravity .
the immediate result that i noticed was a 14 feet rise in the local water table , after 3 days of rain .
so that was a tremendous success . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water reservoirs in a forest near the mosque filtering the rain water according to abdul majeed , the drainage network of the faisal mosque was in place before to protect the building from being flooded .
but instead of wasting the rain water , the water research expert has invented a new system to convert rain water into clean drinking water .
hidden under metal lids in a forest close to the mosque , there are huge reservoirs .
here the water is filtered with the help of sand filter-beds .
after the filter the water runs down vertical pipes up to the ground water level .
according to abdul majeed , the capital development authority , cda is very interested in the project .
" of course the water level will slowly go down again as the water goes into the ground and disappears into different directions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drainage network under the mosque 200 million liters needed every day " so if this technology could be replicated by the cda all over islamabad in different places , where they have a dense network of rainfall collecting systems , it would automatically go into the ground and recharge the aquifers.the cda chairman was very excited after seeing the project demonstartion and said that they would replicate this project at 100 different places in islamabad . "
islamabad 's two million citizens have a daily consumption of 200 million liters of water .
meanwhile , islamabad 's building code has been amended to include rain water harvesting design specifications for buildings with a footprint of more than 400 square yards .

but who will make deutsche welle 's list of the best 11 in south africa ? the jury for deutsche welle 's top xi consisted of sports editor matt hermann , reporters nick amies and jefferson chase and a special guest .
this year , dw-tv moderator , political expert and renaissance man peter craven joined the fray .
the rules were simple .
four guys , each with one vote per position , come up with the super-duper starting lineup .
four being an even number , we also introduced a tiebreaker .
in case of two of more players being judged relatively equal , the one with the best hair got the nod .
so without any further ado , and staying with the hair theme , here are our picks .
diego and david bildunterschrift : at dw , we 're big fans of forlan peter made an impassioned plea for miroslav klose to be included , in response to jefferson arguing that a fair number of his 14 career world cup goals were tap-ins .
but ultimately , miro had to take a back seat to two of the best players of the tournament .
the first is diego forlan , the uruguay forward who was deservedly named the world cup mvp .
as matt putt it , " he played on a defensively minded team that offered only intermittent support and was the heart and soul throughout . "
normally , we hate football players with loads of talent and swept-back , movie-star blond locks .
but forlan also seemed like a genuinely nice guy when interviewed and played in the true spirit of the beautiful game .
so diego , if you 're ever in berlin , bonn or brussels , we 'd like to buy you a beer .
slightly less likeable but no less prodigious was spain 's david villa .
the diminutive forward kept the spanish in the tournament when they stumbled early on and scored an outrageous goal from just inside the halfway line against chile .
plus he gets extra points for the frank zappa-esque goatee thing .
tommy , schweini , wesley and xavi bildunterschrift : twenty-year-old thomas mueller was the man against argentina the 2010 world cup was a midfielders ' tournament , and ghana 's kevin-prince boateng and japan 's honda drew kudos from the jury .
but ultimately there was consensus on who the middle four should be .
twenty-year-old thomas mueller made everyone 's list .
at an age where most young men 's greatest life achievement involves a fifth of jack daniel 's and a funnel , the german world cup debutant picked up the golden boot and , almost as an afterthought , the best young player award .
his teammate bastian schweinsteiger also swept our ballots for holding midfielder .
we were impressed not only with his presence in midfield but also his leadership qualities , which were one reason germany recovered so well from the loss of captain michael ballack to injury .
the netherlands ' wesley sneijder was a somewhat more curious case .
he never seemed to do anything all that spectacular but ended the world cup with five goals .
as nick put it , " he kind of embodies the dutch approach of players who are really talented and really mouthy - i like that . "
bildunterschrift : xavi is our midfield leader that left one big question : who to take from spain ?
the options , obviously , were xavi or iniesta , but that was like asking a hardcore radiohead fan to say whether " ok computer " or " kid a " is a better album .
iniesta scored two crucial goals , while xavi looked more like the true field general and delivered the pinpoint corner kick that propelled spain past germany .
in the end , xavi won on the hair rule .
iniesta has hardly any , while xavi 's michael corleone slick-back perfectly reflects his ruthless strategic acumen on the pitch .
king poodle and consorts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fine example of the hair rule in action left and right back were relatively easy choices .
spain may not have had the greatest offense , but sergio ramos attracted everyone 's votes for being a constant source of pressure up the left flank .
he was also solid defensively , as spain shut out their final four opponents .
meanwhile , maicon did on the right what ramos did on the left .
no opposing defense really had an answer for the burly brazilian , who is much bigger than most players at his position .
as peter succinctly put it , " the selecao disappointed ; maicon did not . "
selecting central defenders was harder , but we felt we had to pay tribute to new zealand 's ryan nelsen .
" he 's a player with limited gifts , but was at the heart of an amazing campaign , " matt pointed out .
" three games , 270 minutes of white-knuckle defending , one goal conceded .
class . "
we were all over the shop , though , when it came to picking nelsen 's partner .
among the candidates we looked at were friedrich , lugano , pique and lucio .
but in the end , one man stood out from the pack .
he 's been called the caveman and king poodle , but presumably never to his face .
spain 's carlos puyol has been around as long as any of us can remember , and his 2010 performance was as gritty , controlled and clutch as any he has ever turned in .
plus , he 's got the best hair since carlos valderrama .
bildunterschrift : stekelenburg was the netherlands ' flying dutchman who should be between the posts was an even tougher call .
the wacky world cup ball meant that the goalkeepers were pretty tentative , and little separated spain 's iker cassilas , germany 's manuel neuer and holland 's maarten stekelenburg .
but stekelenburg was our ultimate choice .
in nick 's words : " the dutch tended to panic in the last six meters before goal , and they were lucky they had such an agile , intelligent keeper who was on the ball . "
the netherlands would in fact have never made the finals had the lanky dutchman not diverted a short by kaka in their quarterfinal against brazil , when the selecao were leading 1-0 .
so we think he makes a fine addition to a cast of 11 that outshone all others in south africa .
so from all of us to all of you : nice work , guys .
and to carlos puyol in particular : love the hair .

but who will make deutsche welle 's list of the best 11 in south africa ? the jury for deutsche welle 's top xi consisted of sports editor matt hermann , reporters nick amies and jefferson chase and a special guest .
this year , dw-tv moderator , political expert and renaissance man peter craven joined the fray .
the rules were simple .
four guys , each with one vote per position , come up with the super-duper starting lineup .
four being an even number , we also introduced a tiebreaker .
in case of two of more players being judged relatively equal , the one with the best hair got the nod .
so without any further ado , and staying with the hair theme , here are our picks .
diego and david bildunterschrift : at dw , we 're big fans of forlan peter made an impassioned plea for miroslav klose to be included , in response to jefferson arguing that a fair number of his 14 career world cup goals were tap-ins .
but ultimately , miro had to take a back seat to two of the best players of the tournament .
the first is diego forlan , the uruguay forward who was deservedly named the world cup mvp .
as matt putt it , " he played on a defensively minded team that offered only intermittent support and was the heart and soul throughout . "
normally , we hate football players with loads of talent and swept-back , movie-star blond locks .
but forlan also seemed like a genuinely nice guy when interviewed and played in the true spirit of the beautiful game .
so diego , if you 're ever in berlin , bonn or brussels , we 'd like to buy you a beer .
slightly less likeable but no less prodigious was spain 's david villa .
the diminutive forward kept the spanish in the tournament when they stumbled early on and scored an outrageous goal from just inside the halfway line against chile .
plus he gets extra points for the frank zappa-esque goatee thing .
tommy , schweini , wesley and xavi bildunterschrift : twenty-year-old thomas mueller was the man against argentina the 2010 world cup was a midfielders ' tournament , and ghana 's kevin-prince boateng and japan 's honda drew kudos from the jury .
but ultimately there was consensus on who the middle four should be .
twenty-year-old thomas mueller made everyone 's list .
at an age where most young men 's greatest life achievement involves a fifth of jack daniel 's and a funnel , the german world cup debutant picked up the golden boot and , almost as an afterthought , the best young player award .
his teammate bastian schweinsteiger also swept our ballots for holding midfielder .
we were impressed not only with his presence in midfield but also his leadership qualities , which were one reason germany recovered so well from the loss of captain michael ballack to injury .
the netherlands ' wesley sneijder was a somewhat more curious case .
he never seemed to do anything all that spectacular but ended the world cup with five goals .
as nick put it , " he kind of embodies the dutch approach of players who are really talented and really mouthy - i like that . "
bildunterschrift : xavi is our midfield leader that left one big question : who to take from spain ?
the options , obviously , were xavi or iniesta , but that was like asking a hardcore radiohead fan to say whether " ok computer " or " kid a " is a better album .
iniesta scored two crucial goals , while xavi looked more like the true field general and delivered the pinpoint corner kick that propelled spain past germany .
in the end , xavi won on the hair rule .
iniesta has hardly any , while xavi 's michael corleone slick-back perfectly reflects his ruthless strategic acumen on the pitch .
king poodle and consorts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fine example of the hair rule in action left and right back were relatively easy choices .
spain may not have had the greatest offense , but sergio ramos attracted everyone 's votes for being a constant source of pressure up the left flank .
he was also solid defensively , as spain shut out their final four opponents .
meanwhile , maicon did on the right what ramos did on the left .
no opposing defense really had an answer for the burly brazilian , who is much bigger than most players at his position .
as peter succinctly put it , " the selecao disappointed ; maicon did not . "
selecting central defenders was harder , but we felt we had to pay tribute to new zealand 's ryan nelsen .
" he 's a player with limited gifts , but was at the heart of an amazing campaign , " matt pointed out .
" three games , 270 minutes of white-knuckle defending , one goal conceded .
class . "
we were all over the shop , though , when it came to picking nelsen 's partner .
among the candidates we looked at were friedrich , lugano , pique and lucio .
but in the end , one man stood out from the pack .
he 's been called the caveman and king poodle , but presumably never to his face .
spain 's carlos puyol has been around as long as any of us can remember , and his 2010 performance was as gritty , controlled and clutch as any he has ever turned in .
plus , he 's got the best hair since carlos valderrama .
bildunterschrift : stekelenburg was the netherlands ' flying dutchman who should be between the posts was an even tougher call .
the wacky world cup ball meant that the goalkeepers were pretty tentative , and little separated spain 's iker cassilas , germany 's manuel neuer and holland 's maarten stekelenburg .
but stekelenburg was our ultimate choice .
in nick 's words : " the dutch tended to panic in the last six meters before goal , and they were lucky they had such an agile , intelligent keeper who was on the ball . "
the netherlands would in fact have never made the finals had the lanky dutchman not diverted a short by kaka in their quarterfinal against brazil , when the selecao were leading 1-0 .
so we think he makes a fine addition to a cast of 11 that outshone all others in south africa .
so from all of us to all of you : nice work , guys .
and to carlos puyol in particular : love the hair .

the diminutive forward kept the spanish in the tournament when they stumbled early on and scored an outrageous goal from just inside the halfway line against chile .
plus he gets extra points for the frank zappa-esque goatee thing .
tommy , schweini , wesley and xavi bildunterschrift : twenty-year-old thomas mueller was the man against argentina the 2010 world cup was a midfielders ' tournament , and ghana 's kevin-prince boateng and japan 's honda drew kudos from the jury .
but ultimately there was consensus on who the middle four should be .
twenty-year-old thomas mueller made everyone 's list .
at an age where most young men 's greatest life achievement involves a fifth of jack daniel 's and a funnel , the german world cup debutant picked up the golden boot and , almost as an afterthought , the best young player award .
his teammate bastian schweinsteiger also swept our ballots for holding midfielder .
we were impressed not only with his presence in midfield but also his leadership qualities , which were one reason germany recovered so well from the loss of captain michael ballack to injury .
the netherlands ' wesley sneijder was a somewhat more curious case .
he never seemed to do anything all that spectacular but ended the world cup with five goals .
as nick put it , " he kind of embodies the dutch approach of players who are really talented and really mouthy - i like that . "
bildunterschrift : xavi is our midfield leader that left one big question : who to take from spain ?
the options , obviously , were xavi or iniesta , but that was like asking a hardcore radiohead fan to say whether " ok computer " or " kid a " is a better album .
iniesta scored two crucial goals , while xavi looked more like the true field general and delivered the pinpoint corner kick that propelled spain past germany .
in the end , xavi won on the hair rule .
iniesta has hardly any , while xavi 's michael corleone slick-back perfectly reflects his ruthless strategic acumen on the pitch .
king poodle and consorts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fine example of the hair rule in action left and right back were relatively easy choices .
spain may not have had the greatest offense , but sergio ramos attracted everyone 's votes for being a constant source of pressure up the left flank .
he was also solid defensively , as spain shut out their final four opponents .
meanwhile , maicon did on the right what ramos did on the left .
no opposing defense really had an answer for the burly brazilian , who is much bigger than most players at his position .
as peter succinctly put it , " the selecao disappointed ; maicon did not . "
selecting central defenders was harder , but we felt we had to pay tribute to new zealand 's ryan nelsen .
" he 's a player with limited gifts , but was at the heart of an amazing campaign , " matt pointed out .
" three games , 270 minutes of white-knuckle defending , one goal conceded .
class . "
we were all over the shop , though , when it came to picking nelsen 's partner .
among the candidates we looked at were friedrich , lugano , pique and lucio .
but in the end , one man stood out from the pack .
he 's been called the caveman and king poodle , but presumably never to his face .
spain 's carlos puyol has been around as long as any of us can remember , and his 2010 performance was as gritty , controlled and clutch as any he has ever turned in .
plus , he 's got the best hair since carlos valderrama .
bildunterschrift : stekelenburg was the netherlands ' flying dutchman who should be between the posts was an even tougher call .
the wacky world cup ball meant that the goalkeepers were pretty tentative , and little separated spain 's iker cassilas , germany 's manuel neuer and holland 's maarten stekelenburg .
but stekelenburg was our ultimate choice .
in nick 's words : " the dutch tended to panic in the last six meters before goal , and they were lucky they had such an agile , intelligent keeper who was on the ball . "
the netherlands would in fact have never made the finals had the lanky dutchman not diverted a short by kaka in their quarterfinal against brazil , when the selecao were leading 1-0 .
so we think he makes a fine addition to a cast of 11 that outshone all others in south africa .
so from all of us to all of you : nice work , guys .
and to carlos puyol in particular : love the hair .

the team 's refreshing brand of offensive soccer inspired fans of the sport worldwide and made many rethink the way they perceive not only german football , but also germany itself .
germany repeated its placing from 2006 , the tournament it hosted , by prevailing 3-2 over a determined uruguay team in saturday 's match for third place .
" we 're not going back home to germany empty-handed , but with a third place finish , which the team has earned , " said national team head coach joachim loew , the architect of germany 's 2010 showing .
during the 2006 world cup , germany showed itself as a friendly and cosmopolitan country , and the event was widely regarded as an overwhelming success from both the organizational and entertainment points of view .
this year , the national team earned the world 's respect with its exciting , high-scoring style of football .
" abroad , this team is perceived as being very likeable , " said newly elected german president christian wulff , who flew to south africa to watch his country play uruguay .
" some africans have told me this team is something of a ' rainbow ' team , diverse and convincing , " he said .
the stirring performance has even led to a recommendation by wulff that loew receive the federal cross of merit for service to the nation , and that the team be awarded the silver bay laurel leaf , the highest sports award in germany .
" the team is the best ambassador germany has in the world , " wulff added .
german soccer legend franz beckenbauer also praised the national team .
" the mood in south africa was euphoric , and many people have told me that the german team has been the best , " he said .
national team manager and former striker oliver bierhoff gleaned a similarly positive message from the tournament .
" we have managed to create a new picture of germany , not only in a sporting sense , but also socially , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany 's young , multicultural squad celebrated a second consecutive third place finish youthful team shines without ballack the sense of just how much bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm , thomas mueller and co. have changed the way germany is perceived can not be overstated .
no longer will there be comparisons between the national team and tanks , but rather respect and recognition for what was regarded as a thrilling and youthful way of playing football .
" in my opinion this is the best team with the most quality of all the national teams i 've played on up until now , " said lahm , who was given the captain 's armband for the tournament in the absence of the injured michael ballack .
the loss of ballack , germany 's lone yet aging superstar , caused a lot of stress among german fans in the weeks leading up to the world cup .
but the absence of the new bayer leverkusen midfielder turned out to be an opportunity for the national team to reinvent itself .
ballack said he was watching with amazement as his young countrymen put in some memorable performances in south africa , particularly the 4-0 thrashing of diego maradona 's argentina .
" it 's scary that such a young team could take a classy team like argentina , " he said .
goals galore germany also put in great performances against australia , england and uruguay , though group stage games against serbia and ghana left a little to be desired .
the team finished with a goal tally of 16 over seven games , having conceded five .
what 's more , mueller , 20 , picked up the golden boot award with five of those goals and three assists .
mueller also took the award for best young player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semifinal disappointment soon turned to third-place pride for german fans after slotting home eight goals in two games against england and argentina , many pundits were tipping germany to go all the way , but the eventual champions spain proved an insurmountable obstacle .
the swedish newspaper aftonbladet summed up germany 's 1-0 semifinal loss to la furia roja with this comment : " an attractive , young germany required two years -lrb- from the euro 2008 loss to spain -rrb- to rehearse its own variation of spectacular spanish football .
spain needed 90 minutes to show that the germans are not yet the finished product . "
this was a point touched on by schweinsteiger , who himself had an excellent world cup as assistant captain : " we have many young players , who have a big future ahead of them .
they have now gathered a lot of experience from their first tournament .
that is good for future tournaments . "
in addition to being young and relatively unknown outside of germany , the team has also been the subject of much attention due to its multicultural makeup .
eleven of the 23 players on the world cup squad , including mesut oezil , sami khedira and jerome boateng , have roots overseas .
bundesliga in focus with their strong performances in south africa , the german players have boosted their transfer values and fueled the rumor mill .
no day of the world cup went by without players being linked with europe 's top clubs .
mesut oezil in particular is hot property .
five clubs - fc barcelona , manchester city , manchester united , fc valencia and fc arsenal - have apparently expressed interest in securing the playmaker 's transfer from werder bremen .
schweinsteiger hopes , however , that the dazzling performances of the bundesliga players will have the reverse effect .
" we have done the bundesliga proud .
in the future , the biggest players will come to germany , " the midfielder speculated .
loew 's future still uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and his assistant hansi flick 's lucky sweaters took the side far even though a fourth world cup title ultimately eluded germany , loew earned brownie points as the architect of german football 's renaissance in the world 's eyes .
theo zwanziger , president of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , wants to keep the national coach in the job .
" you can trust that i will do everything in my power to make sure that the coaching staff can take this team into the future , " he said .
yet the coach himself has kept a low profile so far .
it still apparently frustrates him that contract talks with the dfb broke down before the tournament .
" after the world cup , i need two or three days to get my thoughts in order .
and then i will certainly have several ideas and visions on how to go on further , " loew said .
he already has the next goal clearly in his sights .
by the 2012 european championship in poland and ukraine , or at the latest at the 2014 world cup in brazil , he wants to win a title .
philipp lahm is also confident about success in the future .
" as you have already seen at past tournaments , we are always in the running for the title , " he said .

in a new project in the capital city islamabad , rainwater is now being harvested to address the problem . when heavy rain comes down on the roof of the faisal mosque in islamabad , around 3 million liters of water a day run through its drainage pipes .
the biggest mosque in pakistan and south asia is no longer only an inspiration for believers , it has recently become a source of people 's well-being .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drainage pipes laid to collect water sanullah aman is the director general of the islamabad water management wing . " we have a very comprehensive plan , that no water should be wasted .
we want to save and conserve the water for our future .
and for that we have planned rain harvesting .
we have started a pilot project at the faisal mosque and till now we have been very successful . "
while monitoring wells throughout islamabad over the past two decades , it has been found that the groundwater level has been falling every year by one or two meters .
so the pakistan government in collaboration with the united nations develpoment programme , undp initiated the pilot project at the faisal mosque to harvest the rain water .
abdul majeed from pakistan council of research in water resources says , " i installed this project just a few weeks back .
the salient feature of this project is that i have installed two bore holes .
they are just acting like tube wells .
we pump the water in the tube wells but in these bore holes we are letting the water flow through gravity .
the immediate result that i noticed was a 14 feet rise in the local water table , after 3 days of rain .
so that was a tremendous success . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water reservoirs in a forest near the mosque filtering the rain water according to abdul majeed , the drainage network of the faisal mosque was in place before to protect the building from being flooded .
but instead of wasting the rain water , the water research expert has invented a new system to convert rain water into clean drinking water .
hidden under metal lids in a forest close to the mosque , there are huge reservoirs .
here the water is filtered with the help of sand filter-beds .
after the filter the water runs down vertical pipes up to the ground water level .
according to abdul majeed , the capital development authority , cda is very interested in the project .
" of course the water level will slowly go down again as the water goes into the ground and disappears into different directions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drainage network under the mosque 200 million liters needed every day " so if this technology could be replicated by the cda all over islamabad in different places , where they have a dense network of rainfall collecting systems , it would automatically go into the ground and recharge the aquifers.the cda chairman was very excited after seeing the project demonstartion and said that they would replicate this project at 100 different places in islamabad . "
islamabad 's two million citizens have a daily consumption of 200 million liters of water .
meanwhile , islamabad 's building code has been amended to include rain water harvesting design specifications for buildings with a footprint of more than 400 square yards .

german interior minister thomas de maiziere said he shut down the frankfurt-based ihh -lrb- internationale humanitaere hilfsorganisation -rrb- , found to have been funding the hamas movement which controls gaza and is on the european union 's terror group blacklist .
the group collected 6.6 million euros -lrb- $ 8.3 million -rrb- in donations for hamas , said de maiziere in a statement , and has now been banned because it abused donors ' good intentions in order to " support a terrorist organization with money supposedly donated for charitable purposes . "
according to the german office for the protection of the constitution , the ihh is said to have been led by functionaries of milli gorus , the largest islamist organization in germany . the money the ihh funneled to hamas was collected at mosques belonging to milli gorus .
" organizations that directly or indirectly align themselves from german soil against israel 's very right to existence have forfeited their right to be active in germany , " said de maiziere .
germany has staunchly supported israel following the nazi genocide of european jews in world war ii and is highly critical of hamas , which runs gaza and refuses to recognize israel .

leading members of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their junior partners , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- ended months of intense debate on tuesday of last week when they agreed on a compromise to fill next year 's 11-billion euro -lrb- $ 13.95 billion -rrb- gap in healthcare funding .
a major provision in the bill , crafted by health minister philipp roesler , would raise the mandatory health insurance premium , which is shared by employers and employees , to 15.5 percent of wages , up from the current 14.9 percent .
horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , told public broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that the reform may only last a few years .
he added that he could only breathe easily when politicians say : " we have now found long-term funding , and it 's going to last . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tillich said the bill could not stand in its current form seeds of discontent despite agreement in berlin , some coalition party leaders on the state level were openly rebellious .
the cdu 's stanislaw tillich , premier of saxony , told the daily leipziger volkszeitung that the bill must be amended if the government hoped for parliament 's approval .
" there are a lot of things to talk about , " he said .
" what was agreed in berlin definitely can not be the final outcome . "
baden-wuerttemberg 's cdu premier , stephan mappus , told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung that the bill " is n't the -lrb- promised -rrb- big stride forward yet . "
the rifts over healthcare come at a time when merkel 's coalition has been losing support among the electorate .
a poll conducted earlier this month for public broadcaster ard showed that 79 percent of respondents were either " less satisfied " or " not at all satisfied " with the work of the government .
in addition , both business lobbies and trade unions have voiced their disapproval for the bill .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 12.07.2010 us welcomes cuba 's release of dissidents but remains suspicious großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the release is unlikely to solve the rift in cuba-us relations the release of 52 political prisoners by cuba has been welcomed by the us but while experts admit that this represents a significant shift , cuba needs to take further steps before relations can be normalized . the decision by cuba to release 52 political prisoners has been welcomed by officials in the united states and the european union but while politicians on both sides of the atlantic admit that the move represents a significant shift , the communist caribbean nation needs to take further steps before negotiations on normalizing relations can begin . the deal to release the prisoners , who were among 75 dissidents rounded up during a major crackdown in march 2003 on anti-state and counter-revolutionary charges , was brokered by spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos and cardinal jaime ortega , head of the roman catholic church in cuba .
the 23 other detainees from the 2003 purge have already been released . a number of released prisoners arrived in spain on tuesday . the united states also agreed to house freed prisoners deported from cuba but issued a statement saying that " those released should be free to decide whether to remain in cuba and those who do leave should be able to return to their country . " the latest prisoner release reduces the number of political prisoners held in cuban jails to 167 , the lowest number since fidel castro took power in 1959 , and some observers believe that the move represents a further shift in policy by the raul castro government . prisoner release eases pressure on castro government julia sweig , the director for latin america studies at the council for foreign relations in washington , believes that the prisoner release could provide cuba with some breathing space to address domestic issues regarding much-needed reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul castro hopes to assuage international pressure " i believe we are seeing a gradual reform of cuba under raul castro , " she told deutsche welle .
" by releasing these prisoners , raul is creating space internationally and domestically to press forward . " professor guenther maihold , an expert on latin american foreign policy and international relations at the german institute for international and security affairs , disagrees .
he says the prisoner release is just a tactic to distract the international community . " this does not represent a real change in cuba 's policies , " maihold told deutsche welle .
" there are still many issues that are troubling to the international community , mainly in the human rights arena , and this prisoner release was engineered to limit the international damage to cuba ’ s foreign policy .
this does n't represent any change within cuba and it is unlikely that we 'll see any domestic changes in terms of rights and democracy . " " what we could see is spain pushing for a change to the eu 's 14-year-old ' common position ' on cuba which demands major political reforms and the release of political prisoners in return for normal relations but whether every eu member state will go with this , it 's hard to say . " international pressure forcing cuba to make gestures the international pressure on castro to release prisoners has increased dramatically since orlando zapata tamayo , one of the dissidents captured in the 2003 purge , died from a hunger strike in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farinas ' hunger strike will resume if promises are broken his death caused outrage and forced raul castro to make a public statement of regret .
tamayo 's death prompted a second prisoner , guillermo farinas , to begin his own hunger strike .
it is thought that farinas ' demands - which included the release of 24 ailing fellow political prisoners - in addition to growing international condemnation , led to the freeing of the 52 . " the death of tamayo was a huge blow to the international reputation of cuba , " said maihold .
" again , castro attempted to limit the damage in the international arena by opening negotiations with the catholic church about the prisoner releases .
he wanted to present the outside world with a humanitarian gesture but in reality , it was designed to ease some of the pressure . " while the decision to release the 52 prisoners was welcomed in washington , prompting the most positive comments by a top administration official to date , the us state department was quick to clarify that havana still needed to do more in areas such as human rights before an end to the 50-year-old trade embargo and a normalization of relations could be considered . washington welcomes move but embargo remains for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinto welcomed the move but refused to talk of the embargo us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters that the latest move by havana was overdue but " a positive sign " and " nevertheless very welcome . " reopening dialogue with cuba has been part of the obama administration 's policy of engagement with its adversaries and last year , the white house lifted travel and money transfer restrictions on cuban-americans with relatives in the caribbean nation . the us president has also said that freeing political prisoners was a precondition for a more rapid improvement in bilateral ties , prompting some observers to suggest that the latest prisoner release could lead to congress approving pending legislation that would end the ban on us citizens travelling to cuba . us remains suspicious of castro and his agenda however , despite a shift in position from that of the previous administration , experts believe that obama has so far only taken modest steps to reverse george w. bush 's policy of increased isolation and tightening of sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to keep castro 's cuba at arm 's length " obama has been quite cautious when dealing with cuba and he has taken a very informal approach , " said maihold .
" he has eased some restrictions on travel and visas but he has n't really committed to anything too serious . " " this prisoner release wo n't be seen by the us as a turning point in relations .
it can be seen as a positive result for obama 's approach but washington has seen steps like this in the past where prisoners were released and in a few months cuba was rounding up people from a different group . this will in no way influence the us to lift the embargo . "
" obama 's approach has not gone very far to normalize relations with cuba as yet , " said sweig .
" however , this prisoner release could neutralize some of the domestic political opposition to his stance on cuba and give him and congress the room to start getting rid of sanctions and accelerate his push for bilateral diplomacy with cuba . " " change regarding the embargo in the us is taking place at about the same speed as the reforms in cuba - which is very slowly .
this is about as much as the domestic political structures in both countries can handle right now , " she added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 23 other detainees from the 2003 purge have already been released . a number of released prisoners arrived in spain on tuesday . the united states also agreed to house freed prisoners deported from cuba but issued a statement saying that " those released should be free to decide whether to remain in cuba and those who do leave should be able to return to their country . " the latest prisoner release reduces the number of political prisoners held in cuban jails to 167 , the lowest number since fidel castro took power in 1959 , and some observers believe that the move represents a further shift in policy by the raul castro government . prisoner release eases pressure on castro government julia sweig , the director for latin america studies at the council for foreign relations in washington , believes that the prisoner release could provide cuba with some breathing space to address domestic issues regarding much-needed reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul castro hopes to assuage international pressure " i believe we are seeing a gradual reform of cuba under raul castro , " she told deutsche welle .
" by releasing these prisoners , raul is creating space internationally and domestically to press forward . " professor guenther maihold , an expert on latin american foreign policy and international relations at the german institute for international and security affairs , disagrees .
he says the prisoner release is just a tactic to distract the international community . " this does not represent a real change in cuba 's policies , " maihold told deutsche welle .
" there are still many issues that are troubling to the international community , mainly in the human rights arena , and this prisoner release was engineered to limit the international damage to cuba ’ s foreign policy .
this does n't represent any change within cuba and it is unlikely that we 'll see any domestic changes in terms of rights and democracy . " " what we could see is spain pushing for a change to the eu 's 14-year-old ' common position ' on cuba which demands major political reforms and the release of political prisoners in return for normal relations but whether every eu member state will go with this , it 's hard to say . " international pressure forcing cuba to make gestures the international pressure on castro to release prisoners has increased dramatically since orlando zapata tamayo , one of the dissidents captured in the 2003 purge , died from a hunger strike in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farinas ' hunger strike will resume if promises are broken his death caused outrage and forced raul castro to make a public statement of regret .
tamayo 's death prompted a second prisoner , guillermo farinas , to begin his own hunger strike .
it is thought that farinas ' demands - which included the release of 24 ailing fellow political prisoners - in addition to growing international condemnation , led to the freeing of the 52 . " the death of tamayo was a huge blow to the international reputation of cuba , " said maihold .
" again , castro attempted to limit the damage in the international arena by opening negotiations with the catholic church about the prisoner releases .
he wanted to present the outside world with a humanitarian gesture but in reality , it was designed to ease some of the pressure . " while the decision to release the 52 prisoners was welcomed in washington , prompting the most positive comments by a top administration official to date , the us state department was quick to clarify that havana still needed to do more in areas such as human rights before an end to the 50-year-old trade embargo and a normalization of relations could be considered . washington welcomes move but embargo remains for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinto welcomed the move but refused to talk of the embargo us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters that the latest move by havana was overdue but " a positive sign " and " nevertheless very welcome . " reopening dialogue with cuba has been part of the obama administration 's policy of engagement with its adversaries and last year , the white house lifted travel and money transfer restrictions on cuban-americans with relatives in the caribbean nation . the us president has also said that freeing political prisoners was a precondition for a more rapid improvement in bilateral ties , prompting some observers to suggest that the latest prisoner release could lead to congress approving pending legislation that would end the ban on us citizens travelling to cuba . us remains suspicious of castro and his agenda however , despite a shift in position from that of the previous administration , experts believe that obama has so far only taken modest steps to reverse george w. bush 's policy of increased isolation and tightening of sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to keep castro 's cuba at arm 's length " obama has been quite cautious when dealing with cuba and he has taken a very informal approach , " said maihold .
" he has eased some restrictions on travel and visas but he has n't really committed to anything too serious . " " this prisoner release wo n't be seen by the us as a turning point in relations .
it can be seen as a positive result for obama 's approach but washington has seen steps like this in the past where prisoners were released and in a few months cuba was rounding up people from a different group . this will in no way influence the us to lift the embargo . "
" obama 's approach has not gone very far to normalize relations with cuba as yet , " said sweig .
" however , this prisoner release could neutralize some of the domestic political opposition to his stance on cuba and give him and congress the room to start getting rid of sanctions and accelerate his push for bilateral diplomacy with cuba . " " change regarding the embargo in the us is taking place at about the same speed as the reforms in cuba - which is very slowly .
this is about as much as the domestic political structures in both countries can handle right now , " she added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy is to appear on television on monday evening to talk about the scandal for the first time .
the appearance comes as woerth prepares to launch a controversial pensions bill on tuesday , a central plank of sarkozy 's reform agenda ahead of elections in 2012 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spain lifts first world cup , beating the netherlands world cup -pipe- 12.07.2010 spain 's win down to possession , not goals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only three spain players scored at this year 's world cup by adding the 2010 world cup to their 2008 euro title , the furia roja cemented their place in soccer history .
but to win the ever-elusive big one , the spaniards had to change their style . spain 's ugly 1-0 triumph over the netherlands in johannesburg on sunday was a match most neutral football fans will want to forget as soon as possible .
but the way the spanish claimed the title is truly memorable .
spain scored only eight goals in seven matches , winning each of their four knock-out stage games by a score of 1-0 and setting a new record for the fewest tallies ever by a winner .
to put the numbers in perspective : all previous teams that lifted the trophy scored at least 11 goals .
and in this tournament , third-placed germany found the back of the net twice as often as the spaniards .
indeed , the netherlands , argentina , brazil and even uruguay were more potent offensively than coach vicente del bosque 's men .
with so many of their games coming down to the wire , luck clearly played a role in spain 's first-ever world cup triumph .
but was it accidental ?
not at all .
squad with a flaw bildunterschrift : torres was unable to make a meaningful contribution spain rightly rolled into south africa as one of the pre-tournament favorites .
they were the reigning european champions , having scored 12 goals in 6 matches on their way to the 2008 title and being blessed with a starting midfield drawn exclusively from powerhouses barcelona and real madrid .
but the squad contained a potentially fatal flaw .
striker fernando torres , who was coming off knee surgery , proved to be a shadow of his normal self , rarely capable of getting behind defenses and unable to turn on the ball when he did .
that essentially left spain without an effective center forward , a crucial element in what had been the squad 's free-flowing attack .
the spanish survived the group stage , thanks largely to striker david villa 's individual brilliance , but at that point many people were writing them off .
there was no question that the midfield , anchored by the exceptional xavi and iniesta , would dominate possession and frustrate opponents with their short passing .
but how could spain win if there was no one big up front to serve as a target man ?
strategic adjustment bildunterschrift : villa came up huge the answer lay in a clever , if unorthodox tactical change .
del bosque went even smaller .
villa - whose official height is listed at 1.75 meters -lrb- 5 ' 9 " -rrb- - replaced torres in the middle , while the hole in the squad was filled by diminutive wingers pedro and jesus navas .
the result was something that oddly resembled an italian catenaccio .
spain were n't packing it in at the back , however , as much as they were playing keep-away just inside their opponents ' half .
that made spain less incisive going forward - villa scored the last of his 5 goals -lrb- putting away a rebound off the goalpost -rrb- in the spaniards ' quarterfinal against paraguay .
but the adjustment also put the focus of spain 's remaining matches even more squarely on the midfield , where del bosque had his biggest advantage .
germany and the netherlands ran themselves ragged trying to win the ball back , while spain waited and waited for gaps to open up .
boring , a lot of football fans thought .
but effective .
in every one of their games , spain not only had more possession , but more shots on target than their opponents .
the end of national styles bildunterschrift : xavi , xabi alonso and iniesta anchored a superlative midfield one thing that this world cup made clear in that cliches about how various national teams play the game are in need of serious revision .
historically , spain were always a team that scored a lot and did n't get very far in the world cup .
the spanish teams of 1986 , 1994 and 2002 were twice as productive offensively than the 2010 squad - all were knocked out in the quarterfinals .
the current , more tactically disciplined team is built around an axis of players from barcelona , a club that was for the better part of 11 years -lrb- 1997-2008 -rrb- coached by two dutchmen , louis van gaal and frank rijkaard .
and it was n't just spain that defied stereotypes .
the most attractive offensive team in south africa , germany , featured seven field players from bayern munich , which is now of course coached by van gaal .
conversely , the netherlands came very close to taking this year 's title by abandoning " total football " for a rough-and-tumble style reminiscent of german teams of the past .
their coach bert van marwijk spent two-and-a-half years at bundesliga club borussia dortmund , and the embodiment of the new " tough dutch " style , defensive midfielder mark van bommel , is a barcelona veteran and current mainstay at bayern .
twenty years ago , it would have been unthinkable for the dutch and spanish to sacrifice the beautiful aspect of the beautiful game for results - or that germany would take spectators breaths away with technical acumen and inspiration .
but in the modern , internationalized game , anything is possible .
and that 's a key reason why the former perennial underachievers , spain , hoisted their first world cup trophy on sunday .

the team 's refreshing brand of offensive soccer inspired fans of the sport worldwide and made many rethink the way they perceive not only german football , but also germany itself .
germany repeated its placing from 2006 , the tournament it hosted , by prevailing 3-2 over a determined uruguay team in saturday 's match for third place .
" we 're not going back home to germany empty-handed , but with a third place finish , which the team has earned , " said national team head coach joachim loew , the architect of germany 's 2010 showing .
during the 2006 world cup , germany showed itself as a friendly and cosmopolitan country , and the event was widely regarded as an overwhelming success from both the organizational and entertainment points of view .
this year , the national team earned the world 's respect with its exciting , high-scoring style of football .
" abroad , this team is perceived as being very likeable , " said newly elected german president christian wulff , who flew to south africa to watch his country play uruguay .
" some africans have told me this team is something of a ' rainbow ' team , diverse and convincing , " he said .
the stirring performance has even led to a recommendation by wulff that loew receive the federal cross of merit for service to the nation , and that the team be awarded the silver bay laurel leaf , the highest sports award in germany .
" the team is the best ambassador germany has in the world , " wulff added .
german soccer legend franz beckenbauer also praised the national team .
" the mood in south africa was euphoric , and many people have told me that the german team has been the best , " he said .
national team manager and former striker oliver bierhoff gleaned a similarly positive message from the tournament .
" we have managed to create a new picture of germany , not only in a sporting sense , but also socially , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany 's young , multicultural squad celebrated a second consecutive third place finish youthful team shines without ballack the sense of just how much bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm , thomas mueller and co. have changed the way germany is perceived can not be overstated .
no longer will there be comparisons between the national team and tanks , but rather respect and recognition for what was regarded as a thrilling and youthful way of playing football .
" in my opinion this is the best team with the most quality of all the national teams i 've played on up until now , " said lahm , who was given the captain 's armband for the tournament in the absence of the injured michael ballack .
the loss of ballack , germany 's lone yet aging superstar , caused a lot of stress among german fans in the weeks leading up to the world cup .
but the absence of the new bayer leverkusen midfielder turned out to be an opportunity for the national team to reinvent itself .
ballack said he was watching with amazement as his young countrymen put in some memorable performances in south africa , particularly the 4-0 thrashing of diego maradona 's argentina .
" it 's scary that such a young team could take a classy team like argentina , " he said .
goals galore germany also put in great performances against australia , england and uruguay , though group stage games against serbia and ghana left a little to be desired .
the team finished with a goal tally of 16 over seven games , having conceded five .
what 's more , mueller , 20 , picked up the golden boot award with five of those goals and three assists .
mueller also took the award for best young player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semifinal disappointment soon turned to third-place pride for german fans after slotting home eight goals in two games against england and argentina , many pundits were tipping germany to go all the way , but the eventual champions spain proved an insurmountable obstacle .
the swedish newspaper aftonbladet summed up germany 's 1-0 semifinal loss to la furia roja with this comment : " an attractive , young germany required two years -lrb- from the euro 2008 loss to spain -rrb- to rehearse its own variation of spectacular spanish football .
spain needed 90 minutes to show that the germans are not yet the finished product . "
this was a point touched on by schweinsteiger , who himself had an excellent world cup as assistant captain : " we have many young players , who have a big future ahead of them .
they have now gathered a lot of experience from their first tournament .
that is good for future tournaments . "
in addition to being young and relatively unknown outside of germany , the team has also been the subject of much attention due to its multicultural makeup .
eleven of the 23 players on the world cup squad , including mesut oezil , sami khedira and jerome boateng , have roots overseas .
bundesliga in focus with their strong performances in south africa , the german players have boosted their transfer values and fueled the rumor mill .
no day of the world cup went by without players being linked with europe 's top clubs .
mesut oezil in particular is hot property .
five clubs - fc barcelona , manchester city , manchester united , fc valencia and fc arsenal - have apparently expressed interest in securing the playmaker 's transfer from werder bremen .
schweinsteiger hopes , however , that the dazzling performances of the bundesliga players will have the reverse effect .
" we have done the bundesliga proud .
in the future , the biggest players will come to germany , " the midfielder speculated .
loew 's future still uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and his assistant hansi flick 's lucky sweaters took the side far even though a fourth world cup title ultimately eluded germany , loew earned brownie points as the architect of german football 's renaissance in the world 's eyes .
theo zwanziger , president of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , wants to keep the national coach in the job .
" you can trust that i will do everything in my power to make sure that the coaching staff can take this team into the future , " he said .
yet the coach himself has kept a low profile so far .
it still apparently frustrates him that contract talks with the dfb broke down before the tournament .
" after the world cup , i need two or three days to get my thoughts in order .
and then i will certainly have several ideas and visions on how to go on further , " loew said .
he already has the next goal clearly in his sights .
by the 2012 european championship in poland and ukraine , or at the latest at the 2014 world cup in brazil , he wants to win a title .
philipp lahm is also confident about success in the future .
" as you have already seen at past tournaments , we are always in the running for the title , " he said .

the team 's refreshing brand of offensive soccer inspired fans of the sport worldwide and made many rethink the way they perceive not only german football , but also germany itself .
germany repeated its placing from 2006 , the tournament it hosted , by prevailing 3-2 over a determined uruguay team in saturday 's match for third place .
" we 're not going back home to germany empty-handed , but with a third place finish , which the team has earned , " said national team head coach joachim loew , the architect of germany 's 2010 showing .
during the 2006 world cup , germany showed itself as a friendly and cosmopolitan country , and the event was widely regarded as an overwhelming success from both the organizational and entertainment points of view .
this year , the national team earned the world 's respect with its exciting , high-scoring style of football .
" abroad , this team is perceived as being very likeable , " said newly elected german president christian wulff , who flew to south africa to watch his country play uruguay .
" some africans have told me this team is something of a ' rainbow ' team , diverse and convincing , " he said .
the stirring performance has even led to a recommendation by wulff that loew receive the federal cross of merit for service to the nation , and that the team be awarded the silver bay laurel leaf , the highest sports award in germany .
" the team is the best ambassador germany has in the world , " wulff added .
german soccer legend franz beckenbauer also praised the national team .
" the mood in south africa was euphoric , and many people have told me that the german team has been the best , " he said .
national team manager and former striker oliver bierhoff gleaned a similarly positive message from the tournament .
" we have managed to create a new picture of germany , not only in a sporting sense , but also socially , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany 's young , multicultural squad celebrated a second consecutive third place finish youthful team shines without ballack the sense of just how much bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm , thomas mueller and co. have changed the way germany is perceived can not be overstated .
no longer will there be comparisons between the national team and tanks , but rather respect and recognition for what was regarded as a thrilling and youthful way of playing football .
" in my opinion this is the best team with the most quality of all the national teams i 've played on up until now , " said lahm , who was given the captain 's armband for the tournament in the absence of the injured michael ballack .
the loss of ballack , germany 's lone yet aging superstar , caused a lot of stress among german fans in the weeks leading up to the world cup .
but the absence of the new bayer leverkusen midfielder turned out to be an opportunity for the national team to reinvent itself .
ballack said he was watching with amazement as his young countrymen put in some memorable performances in south africa , particularly the 4-0 thrashing of diego maradona 's argentina .
" it 's scary that such a young team could take a classy team like argentina , " he said .
goals galore germany also put in great performances against australia , england and uruguay , though group stage games against serbia and ghana left a little to be desired .
the team finished with a goal tally of 16 over seven games , having conceded five .
what 's more , mueller , 20 , picked up the golden boot award with five of those goals and three assists .
mueller also took the award for best young player .

the swedish newspaper aftonbladet summed up germany 's 1-0 semifinal loss to la furia roja with this comment : " an attractive , young germany required two years -lrb- from the euro 2008 loss to spain -rrb- to rehearse its own variation of spectacular spanish football .

but to win the ever-elusive big one , the spaniards had to change their style . spain 's ugly 1-0 triumph over the netherlands in johannesburg on sunday was a match most neutral football fans will want to forget as soon as possible .
but the way the spanish claimed the title is truly memorable .
spain scored only eight goals in seven matches , winning each of their four knock-out stage games by a score of 1-0 and setting a new record for the fewest tallies ever by a winner .
to put the numbers in perspective : all previous teams that lifted the trophy scored at least 11 goals .
and in this tournament , third-placed germany found the back of the net twice as often as the spaniards .
indeed , the netherlands , argentina , brazil and even uruguay were more potent offensively than coach vicente del bosque 's men .
with so many of their games coming down to the wire , luck clearly played a role in spain 's first-ever world cup triumph .
but was it accidental ?
not at all .
squad with a flaw bildunterschrift : torres was unable to make a meaningful contribution spain rightly rolled into south africa as one of the pre-tournament favorites .
they were the reigning european champions , having scored 12 goals in 6 matches on their way to the 2008 title and being blessed with a starting midfield drawn exclusively from powerhouses barcelona and real madrid .
but the squad contained a potentially fatal flaw .
striker fernando torres , who was coming off knee surgery , proved to be a shadow of his normal self , rarely capable of getting behind defenses and unable to turn on the ball when he did .
that essentially left spain without an effective center forward , a crucial element in what had been the squad 's free-flowing attack .
the spanish survived the group stage , thanks largely to striker david villa 's individual brilliance , but at that point many people were writing them off .
there was no question that the midfield , anchored by the exceptional xavi and iniesta , would dominate possession and frustrate opponents with their short passing .
but how could spain win if there was no one big up front to serve as a target man ?
strategic adjustment bildunterschrift : villa came up huge the answer lay in a clever , if unorthodox tactical change .
del bosque went even smaller .
villa - whose official height is listed at 1.75 meters -lrb- 5 ' 9 " -rrb- - replaced torres in the middle , while the hole in the squad was filled by diminutive wingers pedro and jesus navas .
the result was something that oddly resembled an italian catenaccio .
spain were n't packing it in at the back , however , as much as they were playing keep-away just inside their opponents ' half .
that made spain less incisive going forward - villa scored the last of his 5 goals -lrb- putting away a rebound off the goalpost -rrb- in the spaniards ' quarterfinal against paraguay .
but the adjustment also put the focus of spain 's remaining matches even more squarely on the midfield , where del bosque had his biggest advantage .
germany and the netherlands ran themselves ragged trying to win the ball back , while spain waited and waited for gaps to open up .
boring , a lot of football fans thought .
but effective .
in every one of their games , spain not only had more possession , but more shots on target than their opponents .
the end of national styles bildunterschrift : xavi , xabi alonso and iniesta anchored a superlative midfield one thing that this world cup made clear in that cliches about how various national teams play the game are in need of serious revision .
historically , spain were always a team that scored a lot and did n't get very far in the world cup .
the spanish teams of 1986 , 1994 and 2002 were twice as productive offensively than the 2010 squad - all were knocked out in the quarterfinals .

and it was n't just spain that defied stereotypes .
the most attractive offensive team in south africa , germany , featured seven field players from bayern munich , which is now of course coached by van gaal .
conversely , the netherlands came very close to taking this year 's title by abandoning " total football " for a rough-and-tumble style reminiscent of german teams of the past .
their coach bert van marwijk spent two-and-a-half years at bundesliga club borussia dortmund , and the embodiment of the new " tough dutch " style , defensive midfielder mark van bommel , is a barcelona veteran and current mainstay at bayern .

but to win the ever-elusive big one , the spaniards had to change their style . spain 's ugly 1-0 triumph over the netherlands in johannesburg on sunday was a match most neutral football fans will want to forget as soon as possible .
but the way the spanish claimed the title is truly memorable .
spain scored only eight goals in seven matches , winning each of their four knock-out stage games by a score of 1-0 and setting a new record for the fewest tallies ever by a winner .
to put the numbers in perspective : all previous teams that lifted the trophy scored at least 11 goals .
and in this tournament , third-placed germany found the back of the net twice as often as the spaniards .
indeed , the netherlands , argentina , brazil and even uruguay were more potent offensively than coach vicente del bosque 's men .
with so many of their games coming down to the wire , luck clearly played a role in spain 's first-ever world cup triumph .
but was it accidental ?
not at all .
squad with a flaw bildunterschrift : torres was unable to make a meaningful contribution spain rightly rolled into south africa as one of the pre-tournament favorites .
they were the reigning european champions , having scored 12 goals in 6 matches on their way to the 2008 title and being blessed with a starting midfield drawn exclusively from powerhouses barcelona and real madrid .
but the squad contained a potentially fatal flaw .
striker fernando torres , who was coming off knee surgery , proved to be a shadow of his normal self , rarely capable of getting behind defenses and unable to turn on the ball when he did .
that essentially left spain without an effective center forward , a crucial element in what had been the squad 's free-flowing attack .
the spanish survived the group stage , thanks largely to striker david villa 's individual brilliance , but at that point many people were writing them off .
there was no question that the midfield , anchored by the exceptional xavi and iniesta , would dominate possession and frustrate opponents with their short passing .
but how could spain win if there was no one big up front to serve as a target man ?
strategic adjustment bildunterschrift : villa came up huge the answer lay in a clever , if unorthodox tactical change .
del bosque went even smaller .
villa - whose official height is listed at 1.75 meters -lrb- 5 ' 9 " -rrb- - replaced torres in the middle , while the hole in the squad was filled by diminutive wingers pedro and jesus navas .
the result was something that oddly resembled an italian catenaccio .
spain were n't packing it in at the back , however , as much as they were playing keep-away just inside their opponents ' half .
that made spain less incisive going forward - villa scored the last of his 5 goals -lrb- putting away a rebound off the goalpost -rrb- in the spaniards ' quarterfinal against paraguay .
but the adjustment also put the focus of spain 's remaining matches even more squarely on the midfield , where del bosque had his biggest advantage .
germany and the netherlands ran themselves ragged trying to win the ball back , while spain waited and waited for gaps to open up .
boring , a lot of football fans thought .
but effective .
in every one of their games , spain not only had more possession , but more shots on target than their opponents .
the end of national styles bildunterschrift : xavi , xabi alonso and iniesta anchored a superlative midfield one thing that this world cup made clear in that cliches about how various national teams play the game are in need of serious revision .
historically , spain were always a team that scored a lot and did n't get very far in the world cup .
the spanish teams of 1986 , 1994 and 2002 were twice as productive offensively than the 2010 squad - all were knocked out in the quarterfinals .
the current , more tactically disciplined team is built around an axis of players from barcelona , a club that was for the better part of 11 years -lrb- 1997-2008 -rrb- coached by two dutchmen , louis van gaal and frank rijkaard .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 12.07.2010 us welcomes cuba 's release of dissidents but remains suspicious großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the release is unlikely to solve the rift in cuba-us relations the release of 52 political prisoners by cuba has been welcomed by the us but while experts admit that this represents a significant shift , cuba needs to take further steps before relations can be normalized . the decision by cuba to release 52 political prisoners has been welcomed by officials in the united states and the european union but while politicians on both sides of the atlantic admit that the move represents a significant shift , the communist caribbean nation needs to take further steps before negotiations on normalizing relations can begin . the deal to release the prisoners , who were among 75 dissidents rounded up during a major crackdown in march 2003 on anti-state and counter-revolutionary charges , was brokered by spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos and cardinal jaime ortega , head of the roman catholic church in cuba .
the 23 other detainees from the 2003 purge have already been released . a number of released prisoners arrived in spain on tuesday . the united states also agreed to house freed prisoners deported from cuba but issued a statement saying that " those released should be free to decide whether to remain in cuba and those who do leave should be able to return to their country . " the latest prisoner release reduces the number of political prisoners held in cuban jails to 167 , the lowest number since fidel castro took power in 1959 , and some observers believe that the move represents a further shift in policy by the raul castro government . prisoner release eases pressure on castro government julia sweig , the director for latin america studies at the council for foreign relations in washington , believes that the prisoner release could provide cuba with some breathing space to address domestic issues regarding much-needed reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul castro hopes to assuage international pressure " i believe we are seeing a gradual reform of cuba under raul castro , " she told deutsche welle .
" by releasing these prisoners , raul is creating space internationally and domestically to press forward . " professor guenther maihold , an expert on latin american foreign policy and international relations at the german institute for international and security affairs , disagrees .
he says the prisoner release is just a tactic to distract the international community . " this does not represent a real change in cuba 's policies , " maihold told deutsche welle .
" there are still many issues that are troubling to the international community , mainly in the human rights arena , and this prisoner release was engineered to limit the international damage to cuba ’ s foreign policy .
this does n't represent any change within cuba and it is unlikely that we 'll see any domestic changes in terms of rights and democracy . " " what we could see is spain pushing for a change to the eu 's 14-year-old ' common position ' on cuba which demands major political reforms and the release of political prisoners in return for normal relations but whether every eu member state will go with this , it 's hard to say . " international pressure forcing cuba to make gestures the international pressure on castro to release prisoners has increased dramatically since orlando zapata tamayo , one of the dissidents captured in the 2003 purge , died from a hunger strike in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farinas ' hunger strike will resume if promises are broken his death caused outrage and forced raul castro to make a public statement of regret .
tamayo 's death prompted a second prisoner , guillermo farinas , to begin his own hunger strike .
it is thought that farinas ' demands - which included the release of 24 ailing fellow political prisoners - in addition to growing international condemnation , led to the freeing of the 52 . " the death of tamayo was a huge blow to the international reputation of cuba , " said maihold .
" again , castro attempted to limit the damage in the international arena by opening negotiations with the catholic church about the prisoner releases .
he wanted to present the outside world with a humanitarian gesture but in reality , it was designed to ease some of the pressure . " while the decision to release the 52 prisoners was welcomed in washington , prompting the most positive comments by a top administration official to date , the us state department was quick to clarify that havana still needed to do more in areas such as human rights before an end to the 50-year-old trade embargo and a normalization of relations could be considered . washington welcomes move but embargo remains for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinto welcomed the move but refused to talk of the embargo us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters that the latest move by havana was overdue but " a positive sign " and " nevertheless very welcome . " reopening dialogue with cuba has been part of the obama administration 's policy of engagement with its adversaries and last year , the white house lifted travel and money transfer restrictions on cuban-americans with relatives in the caribbean nation . the us president has also said that freeing political prisoners was a precondition for a more rapid improvement in bilateral ties , prompting some observers to suggest that the latest prisoner release could lead to congress approving pending legislation that would end the ban on us citizens travelling to cuba . us remains suspicious of castro and his agenda however , despite a shift in position from that of the previous administration , experts believe that obama has so far only taken modest steps to reverse george w. bush 's policy of increased isolation and tightening of sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to keep castro 's cuba at arm 's length " obama has been quite cautious when dealing with cuba and he has taken a very informal approach , " said maihold .
" he has eased some restrictions on travel and visas but he has n't really committed to anything too serious . " " this prisoner release wo n't be seen by the us as a turning point in relations .
it can be seen as a positive result for obama 's approach but washington has seen steps like this in the past where prisoners were released and in a few months cuba was rounding up people from a different group . this will in no way influence the us to lift the embargo . "
" obama 's approach has not gone very far to normalize relations with cuba as yet , " said sweig .
" however , this prisoner release could neutralize some of the domestic political opposition to his stance on cuba and give him and congress the room to start getting rid of sanctions and accelerate his push for bilateral diplomacy with cuba . " " change regarding the embargo in the us is taking place at about the same speed as the reforms in cuba - which is very slowly .
this is about as much as the domestic political structures in both countries can handle right now , " she added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 23 other detainees from the 2003 purge have already been released . a number of released prisoners arrived in spain on tuesday . the united states also agreed to house freed prisoners deported from cuba but issued a statement saying that " those released should be free to decide whether to remain in cuba and those who do leave should be able to return to their country . " the latest prisoner release reduces the number of political prisoners held in cuban jails to 167 , the lowest number since fidel castro took power in 1959 , and some observers believe that the move represents a further shift in policy by the raul castro government . prisoner release eases pressure on castro government julia sweig , the director for latin america studies at the council for foreign relations in washington , believes that the prisoner release could provide cuba with some breathing space to address domestic issues regarding much-needed reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul castro hopes to assuage international pressure " i believe we are seeing a gradual reform of cuba under raul castro , " she told deutsche welle .
" by releasing these prisoners , raul is creating space internationally and domestically to press forward . " professor guenther maihold , an expert on latin american foreign policy and international relations at the german institute for international and security affairs , disagrees .
he says the prisoner release is just a tactic to distract the international community . " this does not represent a real change in cuba 's policies , " maihold told deutsche welle .
" there are still many issues that are troubling to the international community , mainly in the human rights arena , and this prisoner release was engineered to limit the international damage to cuba ’ s foreign policy .
this does n't represent any change within cuba and it is unlikely that we 'll see any domestic changes in terms of rights and democracy . " " what we could see is spain pushing for a change to the eu 's 14-year-old ' common position ' on cuba which demands major political reforms and the release of political prisoners in return for normal relations but whether every eu member state will go with this , it 's hard to say . " international pressure forcing cuba to make gestures the international pressure on castro to release prisoners has increased dramatically since orlando zapata tamayo , one of the dissidents captured in the 2003 purge , died from a hunger strike in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farinas ' hunger strike will resume if promises are broken his death caused outrage and forced raul castro to make a public statement of regret .
tamayo 's death prompted a second prisoner , guillermo farinas , to begin his own hunger strike .
it is thought that farinas ' demands - which included the release of 24 ailing fellow political prisoners - in addition to growing international condemnation , led to the freeing of the 52 . " the death of tamayo was a huge blow to the international reputation of cuba , " said maihold .
" again , castro attempted to limit the damage in the international arena by opening negotiations with the catholic church about the prisoner releases .
he wanted to present the outside world with a humanitarian gesture but in reality , it was designed to ease some of the pressure . " while the decision to release the 52 prisoners was welcomed in washington , prompting the most positive comments by a top administration official to date , the us state department was quick to clarify that havana still needed to do more in areas such as human rights before an end to the 50-year-old trade embargo and a normalization of relations could be considered . washington welcomes move but embargo remains for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinto welcomed the move but refused to talk of the embargo us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters that the latest move by havana was overdue but " a positive sign " and " nevertheless very welcome .

all government officials must report their personal details such as income , assets and the whereabouts of their family members , state media said .
the move is a fresh attempt by the chinese government to combat endemic graft . the new rules went into effect on sunday .
they apply to all officials in government posts , political parties and state-owned companies , according to the china daily .
under the rules , the officials are required to report their salary , income from other sources , property owned by them and their family members and investments .
officials are also required to inform the authorities of changes in marital status and the occupations of their spouses and children spouses and children .
officials in china have a long history of hiding their illicit incomes under the names of spouses or other relatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the officials are now required to report their salary and income from other sources punishment for defaulters the state media said those officials who failed to follow the new rules would face punishment ranging from criticism of their conduct to dismissal .
but , as the china daily reported , the new rules fall short of requiring that the income and assets of chinese officials be made public .
the new rules were issued jointly by the state council , china 's cabinet and the ruling communist party .
they are an expansion of regulations adopted in 1995 and 2006 .
the move comes amid increasing complains by ordinary chinese citizens about growing official corruption .
tackling graft is crucial for the communist party , which sees it as a major threat to political stability. du / afp / ap editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

forty-four passengers needed medical attention after travelling on a high-speed train with a broken air conditioning system . german police are investigating charges against rail operator deutsche bahn after 44 passengers needed medical attention after travelling on a high-speed train with a broken air conditioning system on the weekend .
near-panic broke out on board the ice train from berlin to cologne on saturday when several high-school students returning from a school trip collapsed and lay unconscious and dehydrated in the aisle .
the train was eventually stopped in the central german town of bielefeld .
" people were already collapsing in the train , and four of our students hyperventilated when they stepped out onto the platform , " said distressed teacher dagmar reichenberg-arnoldy , as emergency doctors attended to her class on the platform .
three trains were affected , nine students and elderly passengers ended up in hospital and a pregnant woman tried to smash a window with an emergency hammer in desperation .
with outside temperatures of up to 38 degrees celsius , a broken air-conditioning system and sealed windows , temperatures within reportedly reached up to 50 degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruediger grube promised compensation damage control deutsche bahn 's public relations department quickly attempted some damage control , with boss ruediger grube promising compensation .
spokesman juergen kornmann appealed for the public to put saturday 's events in perspective .
" we operate 1,400 inter-city connections every day , and yesterday we had problems - big problems i admit - on three of the trains , " he said .
" so one can see the vast majority of travelers arrive safely and comfortably . "
but these justifications have not prevented saturday 's events from catching the attention of the police , who announced that they have begun investigations into deutsche bahn on suspicion of causing bodily harm by negligence .
a police spokeswoman said the problem with the air-conditioning had been known well before the train was stopped in bielefeld .
endemic problems ?
meanwhile , passengers on other trains have since come forward to report problems on other trains .
oliver rasche , who was travelling on a stretch from bochum to berlin on saturday , complained about the way deutsche bahn handled the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temperature inside the train was estimated at 50 degrees celsius " there was no official reaction or official announcement at all that the train was damaged or that the air-conditioning was not working , " he said .
" you just realized it was getting hotter and hotter . "
dirty filters , causing the air-conditioning to overheat and shut itself down , have been blamed for the problems , and karl-peter naumann of public transport passenger organization pro bahn believes cost-cutting schemes in deutsche bahn 's maintenance department have caused endemic problems .
" i think that parts relevant to safety - the wheels and the axles - are being cared for very thoroughly , but i 'm afraid that means the air-conditioning system is neglected , " he told german broadcaster ntv .
if saturday 's dramatic events are traced to a lack of maintenance in on-board systems , deutsche bahn could face serious legal trouble .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 12.07.2010 colombia 's new president faces awkward questions over civilian murders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santos was defense minister at the height of the civilian killings new colombian president juan manuel santos faces a difficult month before his inaugeration in august as the un human rights council is expected to hear allegations about his and his predecessor 's role in civilian deaths . victory for santos in colombia 's election runoff against rival antanas mockus , a former defense minister , may mean a new leader takes the reins but his presidency will mean an old scandal will continue to dog and haunt the country .
as santos prepares to take over from out-going president álvaro uribe on august 7 , his and his predecessor 's names are expected to feature in hearings at the un human rights council this month on allegations relating to their roles in the illegal killings of civilians .
while serving in the uribe administration as defense minister between 2006 and 2009 , santos was in charge of the military at a time when the colombian army 's alleged policy of murdering civilians in so-called " false positive " killings was at its height .
it is alleged that army units killed civilians to artificially increase the number of combat fatalities in battles against rebel group the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- .
santos was responsible for coordinating uribe 's mission to eradicate colombia of farc and restore security to one of the most violent countries in the world .
the military operation forced farc out of the cities into remote jungle areas , radically reduced the number of killings and kidnappings in urban areas and rescued colombia from becoming a failed state .
the success of uribe 's mission cemented his popularity and created his reputation among many as the man who saved colombia .
missing civilians linked to expanding war on farc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian troops are accused of killing civilians as farc rebels however , human rights campaigners and international investigators were first alerted to a dark by-product of uribe 's campaign by accusations from families of missing men who claimed that the massive gains the colombian military were making against farc were being boosted by the " false positive " killings of innocent civilians .
the allegations and subsequent investigations led to the removal of the chief of the colombian military and 27 of his officers but santos was spared .
the colombian government has since taken further steps to prevent such killings but , according to un statistics , up to 98.5 percent remain unpunished .
santos continues to claim the killings were the acts of individual soldiers and units and were not sanctioned by the defense ministry .
un investigators remain unconvinced .
" there have been too many killings of a similar nature to characterize them as isolated incidents carried out by individual rogue soldiers or units , or ' bad apples ' , " philip alston , the un 's special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings wrote in a report presented to the un human rights council on june 3 .
" soldiers simply knew that they could get away with murder . "
poor people executed as rebels to boost casualty figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all farc deaths were rebel victims one of the cases being investigated focuses on soacha , a poor suburb of the capital bogotá , and the town of ocaña some 600 kilometers -lrb- 372 miles -rrb- away .
in 2008 , it is alleged that dozens of young men were lured from soacha by paramilitaries and criminals promising employment in ocaña .
once there , they were allegedly sold to colombian army units which executed them as farc guerrillas .
their bodies were then supposedly clothed in military fatigues and draped with weapons and equipment .
the dead were then claimed to be rebel casualties in uribe 's fight against farc .
for the families , this made no sense .
how could the men of soacha , most unable to read or write , others with mental disabilities , transform themselves into uniformed , armed guerrillas ready to take on the battle-hardened colombian military , just days after leaving home ?
" the doctor and the judge said that my son was killed in combat at 2.45am on march 5 , " one mother told deutsche welle .
" his corpse was clothed in camouflage and boots - completely different clothes from what he was wearing when he left . " " the investigations must examine everything , because this can not continue like this , " another anonymous mother from soacha told deutsche welle .
" we will not rest .
this must not go unpunished , although i know that colombia is the land of impunity . " this is just one of the approximately 1,300 cases being examined by investigators from the public prosecutor 's office which suspect military personnel of murdering civilians and claiming they were guerrillas killed in combat in order to win bonuses of up to € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,890 -rrb- per victim .
human rights campaigners suggest that over 2,000 young men were killed and buried in common graves as part of this policy . it is alleged that the kill bonus for units reporting higher enemy body counts , introduced by uribe 's administration in 2005 as part of its intensifying offensive against farc , contributed to the practise of abducting civilians and executing them as rebels .
the large increase of civilian disappearances in colombia can be traced back to this time . former leader claims the ends justified the means in the past , uribe has defended his government 's use of all necessary force to combat farc , saying that the country is safer than ever now due to his crackdown .
his opponents reject his argument that the ends justify the means . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uribe said that the force used to rout farc was justified " the reasoning of the government is completely worn out in my opinion and santos must find alternatives , " camilo gonzalez pozo , director of the colombian institute for the study of development and peace , told deutsche welle .

as santos prepares to take over from out-going president álvaro uribe on august 7 , his and his predecessor 's names are expected to feature in hearings at the un human rights council this month on allegations relating to their roles in the illegal killings of civilians .
while serving in the uribe administration as defense minister between 2006 and 2009 , santos was in charge of the military at a time when the colombian army 's alleged policy of murdering civilians in so-called " false positive " killings was at its height .
it is alleged that army units killed civilians to artificially increase the number of combat fatalities in battles against rebel group the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- .
santos was responsible for coordinating uribe 's mission to eradicate colombia of farc and restore security to one of the most violent countries in the world .
the military operation forced farc out of the cities into remote jungle areas , radically reduced the number of killings and kidnappings in urban areas and rescued colombia from becoming a failed state .
the success of uribe 's mission cemented his popularity and created his reputation among many as the man who saved colombia .
missing civilians linked to expanding war on farc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian troops are accused of killing civilians as farc rebels however , human rights campaigners and international investigators were first alerted to a dark by-product of uribe 's campaign by accusations from families of missing men who claimed that the massive gains the colombian military were making against farc were being boosted by the " false positive " killings of innocent civilians .
the allegations and subsequent investigations led to the removal of the chief of the colombian military and 27 of his officers but santos was spared .
the colombian government has since taken further steps to prevent such killings but , according to un statistics , up to 98.5 percent remain unpunished .
santos continues to claim the killings were the acts of individual soldiers and units and were not sanctioned by the defense ministry .
un investigators remain unconvinced .
" there have been too many killings of a similar nature to characterize them as isolated incidents carried out by individual rogue soldiers or units , or ' bad apples ' , " philip alston , the un 's special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings wrote in a report presented to the un human rights council on june 3 .
" soldiers simply knew that they could get away with murder . "
poor people executed as rebels to boost casualty figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all farc deaths were rebel victims one of the cases being investigated focuses on soacha , a poor suburb of the capital bogotá , and the town of ocaña some 600 kilometers -lrb- 372 miles -rrb- away .
in 2008 , it is alleged that dozens of young men were lured from soacha by paramilitaries and criminals promising employment in ocaña .
once there , they were allegedly sold to colombian army units which executed them as farc guerrillas .
their bodies were then supposedly clothed in military fatigues and draped with weapons and equipment .
the dead were then claimed to be rebel casualties in uribe 's fight against farc .
for the families , this made no sense .
how could the men of soacha , most unable to read or write , others with mental disabilities , transform themselves into uniformed , armed guerrillas ready to take on the battle-hardened colombian military , just days after leaving home ?
" the doctor and the judge said that my son was killed in combat at 2.45am on march 5 , " one mother told deutsche welle .
" his corpse was clothed in camouflage and boots - completely different clothes from what he was wearing when he left . " " the investigations must examine everything , because this can not continue like this , " another anonymous mother from soacha told deutsche welle .
" we will not rest .
this must not go unpunished , although i know that colombia is the land of impunity . " this is just one of the approximately 1,300 cases being examined by investigators from the public prosecutor 's office which suspect military personnel of murdering civilians and claiming they were guerrillas killed in combat in order to win bonuses of up to € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,890 -rrb- per victim .
human rights campaigners suggest that over 2,000 young men were killed and buried in common graves as part of this policy . it is alleged that the kill bonus for units reporting higher enemy body counts , introduced by uribe 's administration in 2005 as part of its intensifying offensive against farc , contributed to the practise of abducting civilians and executing them as rebels .
the large increase of civilian disappearances in colombia can be traced back to this time . former leader claims the ends justified the means in the past , uribe has defended his government 's use of all necessary force to combat farc , saying that the country is safer than ever now due to his crackdown .
his opponents reject his argument that the ends justify the means . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uribe said that the force used to rout farc was justified " the reasoning of the government is completely worn out in my opinion and santos must find alternatives , " camilo gonzalez pozo , director of the colombian institute for the study of development and peace , told deutsche welle .
" the war against farc was the basis for all uribe 's government decisions .
if there was unemployment , farc was to blame for it .
if there were ' false positives ' then farc was to blame for it .
if there were paramilitaries , then farc was to blame for it .
all these arguments have worn themselves out . " with santos unlikely to swerve from uribe 's course of hunting and destroying farc rebels in the jungles of colombia once he becomes president , the memories of what happened in the early years of the operation are unlikely to dissipate .

in a new project in the capital city islamabad , rainwater is now being harvested to address the problem . when heavy rain comes down on the roof of the faisal mosque in islamabad , around 3 million liters of water a day run through its drainage pipes .
the biggest mosque in pakistan and south asia is no longer only an inspiration for believers , it has recently become a source of people 's well-being .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drainage pipes laid to collect water sanullah aman is the director general of the islamabad water management wing . " we have a very comprehensive plan , that no water should be wasted .
we want to save and conserve the water for our future .
and for that we have planned rain harvesting .
we have started a pilot project at the faisal mosque and till now we have been very successful . "
while monitoring wells throughout islamabad over the past two decades , it has been found that the groundwater level has been falling every year by one or two meters .
so the pakistan government in collaboration with the united nations develpoment programme , undp initiated the pilot project at the faisal mosque to harvest the rain water .
abdul majeed from pakistan council of research in water resources says , " i installed this project just a few weeks back .
the salient feature of this project is that i have installed two bore holes .
they are just acting like tube wells .
we pump the water in the tube wells but in these bore holes we are letting the water flow through gravity .

in a new project in the capital city islamabad , rainwater is now being harvested to address the problem . when heavy rain comes down on the roof of the faisal mosque in islamabad , around 3 million liters of water a day run through its drainage pipes .
the biggest mosque in pakistan and south asia is no longer only an inspiration for believers , it has recently become a source of people 's well-being .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drainage pipes laid to collect water sanullah aman is the director general of the islamabad water management wing . " we have a very comprehensive plan , that no water should be wasted .
we want to save and conserve the water for our future .
and for that we have planned rain harvesting .
we have started a pilot project at the faisal mosque and till now we have been very successful . "
while monitoring wells throughout islamabad over the past two decades , it has been found that the groundwater level has been falling every year by one or two meters .
so the pakistan government in collaboration with the united nations develpoment programme , undp initiated the pilot project at the faisal mosque to harvest the rain water .
abdul majeed from pakistan council of research in water resources says , " i installed this project just a few weeks back .
the salient feature of this project is that i have installed two bore holes .
they are just acting like tube wells .
we pump the water in the tube wells but in these bore holes we are letting the water flow through gravity .
the immediate result that i noticed was a 14 feet rise in the local water table , after 3 days of rain .
so that was a tremendous success . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water reservoirs in a forest near the mosque filtering the rain water according to abdul majeed , the drainage network of the faisal mosque was in place before to protect the building from being flooded .
but instead of wasting the rain water , the water research expert has invented a new system to convert rain water into clean drinking water .
hidden under metal lids in a forest close to the mosque , there are huge reservoirs .
here the water is filtered with the help of sand filter-beds .
after the filter the water runs down vertical pipes up to the ground water level .
according to abdul majeed , the capital development authority , cda is very interested in the project .
" of course the water level will slowly go down again as the water goes into the ground and disappears into different directions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drainage network under the mosque 200 million liters needed every day " so if this technology could be replicated by the cda all over islamabad in different places , where they have a dense network of rainfall collecting systems , it would automatically go into the ground and recharge the aquifers.the cda chairman was very excited after seeing the project demonstartion and said that they would replicate this project at 100 different places in islamabad . "
islamabad 's two million citizens have a daily consumption of 200 million liters of water .
meanwhile , islamabad 's building code has been amended to include rain water harvesting design specifications for buildings with a footprint of more than 400 square yards .

leading members of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their junior partners , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- ended months of intense debate on tuesday of last week when they agreed on a compromise to fill next year 's 11-billion euro -lrb- $ 13.95 billion -rrb- gap in healthcare funding .
a major provision in the bill , crafted by health minister philipp roesler , would raise the mandatory health insurance premium , which is shared by employers and employees , to 15.5 percent of wages , up from the current 14.9 percent .
horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , told public broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that the reform may only last a few years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 12.07.2010 colombia 's new president faces awkward questions over civilian murders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santos was defense minister at the height of the civilian killings new colombian president juan manuel santos faces a difficult month before his inaugeration in august as the un human rights council is expected to hear allegations about his and his predecessor 's role in civilian deaths . victory for santos in colombia 's election runoff against rival antanas mockus , a former defense minister , may mean a new leader takes the reins but his presidency will mean an old scandal will continue to dog and haunt the country .
as santos prepares to take over from out-going president álvaro uribe on august 7 , his and his predecessor 's names are expected to feature in hearings at the un human rights council this month on allegations relating to their roles in the illegal killings of civilians .
while serving in the uribe administration as defense minister between 2006 and 2009 , santos was in charge of the military at a time when the colombian army 's alleged policy of murdering civilians in so-called " false positive " killings was at its height .
it is alleged that army units killed civilians to artificially increase the number of combat fatalities in battles against rebel group the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- .
santos was responsible for coordinating uribe 's mission to eradicate colombia of farc and restore security to one of the most violent countries in the world .
the military operation forced farc out of the cities into remote jungle areas , radically reduced the number of killings and kidnappings in urban areas and rescued colombia from becoming a failed state .
the success of uribe 's mission cemented his popularity and created his reputation among many as the man who saved colombia .
missing civilians linked to expanding war on farc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian troops are accused of killing civilians as farc rebels however , human rights campaigners and international investigators were first alerted to a dark by-product of uribe 's campaign by accusations from families of missing men who claimed that the massive gains the colombian military were making against farc were being boosted by the " false positive " killings of innocent civilians .
the allegations and subsequent investigations led to the removal of the chief of the colombian military and 27 of his officers but santos was spared .
the colombian government has since taken further steps to prevent such killings but , according to un statistics , up to 98.5 percent remain unpunished .
santos continues to claim the killings were the acts of individual soldiers and units and were not sanctioned by the defense ministry .
un investigators remain unconvinced .
" there have been too many killings of a similar nature to characterize them as isolated incidents carried out by individual rogue soldiers or units , or ' bad apples ' , " philip alston , the un 's special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings wrote in a report presented to the un human rights council on june 3 .
" soldiers simply knew that they could get away with murder . "
poor people executed as rebels to boost casualty figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all farc deaths were rebel victims one of the cases being investigated focuses on soacha , a poor suburb of the capital bogotá , and the town of ocaña some 600 kilometers -lrb- 372 miles -rrb- away .
in 2008 , it is alleged that dozens of young men were lured from soacha by paramilitaries and criminals promising employment in ocaña .
once there , they were allegedly sold to colombian army units which executed them as farc guerrillas .
their bodies were then supposedly clothed in military fatigues and draped with weapons and equipment .
the dead were then claimed to be rebel casualties in uribe 's fight against farc .
for the families , this made no sense .
how could the men of soacha , most unable to read or write , others with mental disabilities , transform themselves into uniformed , armed guerrillas ready to take on the battle-hardened colombian military , just days after leaving home ?
" the doctor and the judge said that my son was killed in combat at 2.45am on march 5 , " one mother told deutsche welle .
" his corpse was clothed in camouflage and boots - completely different clothes from what he was wearing when he left . " " the investigations must examine everything , because this can not continue like this , " another anonymous mother from soacha told deutsche welle .
" we will not rest .
this must not go unpunished , although i know that colombia is the land of impunity . " this is just one of the approximately 1,300 cases being examined by investigators from the public prosecutor 's office which suspect military personnel of murdering civilians and claiming they were guerrillas killed in combat in order to win bonuses of up to € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,890 -rrb- per victim .
human rights campaigners suggest that over 2,000 young men were killed and buried in common graves as part of this policy . it is alleged that the kill bonus for units reporting higher enemy body counts , introduced by uribe 's administration in 2005 as part of its intensifying offensive against farc , contributed to the practise of abducting civilians and executing them as rebels .
the large increase of civilian disappearances in colombia can be traced back to this time . former leader claims the ends justified the means in the past , uribe has defended his government 's use of all necessary force to combat farc , saying that the country is safer than ever now due to his crackdown .
his opponents reject his argument that the ends justify the means . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uribe said that the force used to rout farc was justified " the reasoning of the government is completely worn out in my opinion and santos must find alternatives , " camilo gonzalez pozo , director of the colombian institute for the study of development and peace , told deutsche welle .
" the war against farc was the basis for all uribe 's government decisions .
if there was unemployment , farc was to blame for it .
if there were ' false positives ' then farc was to blame for it .

as santos prepares to take over from out-going president álvaro uribe on august 7 , his and his predecessor 's names are expected to feature in hearings at the un human rights council this month on allegations relating to their roles in the illegal killings of civilians .
while serving in the uribe administration as defense minister between 2006 and 2009 , santos was in charge of the military at a time when the colombian army 's alleged policy of murdering civilians in so-called " false positive " killings was at its height .
it is alleged that army units killed civilians to artificially increase the number of combat fatalities in battles against rebel group the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- .
santos was responsible for coordinating uribe 's mission to eradicate colombia of farc and restore security to one of the most violent countries in the world .
the military operation forced farc out of the cities into remote jungle areas , radically reduced the number of killings and kidnappings in urban areas and rescued colombia from becoming a failed state .
the success of uribe 's mission cemented his popularity and created his reputation among many as the man who saved colombia .
missing civilians linked to expanding war on farc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian troops are accused of killing civilians as farc rebels however , human rights campaigners and international investigators were first alerted to a dark by-product of uribe 's campaign by accusations from families of missing men who claimed that the massive gains the colombian military were making against farc were being boosted by the " false positive " killings of innocent civilians .
the allegations and subsequent investigations led to the removal of the chief of the colombian military and 27 of his officers but santos was spared .
the colombian government has since taken further steps to prevent such killings but , according to un statistics , up to 98.5 percent remain unpunished .
santos continues to claim the killings were the acts of individual soldiers and units and were not sanctioned by the defense ministry .
un investigators remain unconvinced .
" there have been too many killings of a similar nature to characterize them as isolated incidents carried out by individual rogue soldiers or units , or ' bad apples ' , " philip alston , the un 's special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings wrote in a report presented to the un human rights council on june 3 .
" soldiers simply knew that they could get away with murder . "

in 2008 , it is alleged that dozens of young men were lured from soacha by paramilitaries and criminals promising employment in ocaña .
once there , they were allegedly sold to colombian army units which executed them as farc guerrillas .
their bodies were then supposedly clothed in military fatigues and draped with weapons and equipment .
the dead were then claimed to be rebel casualties in uribe 's fight against farc .
for the families , this made no sense .
how could the men of soacha , most unable to read or write , others with mental disabilities , transform themselves into uniformed , armed guerrillas ready to take on the battle-hardened colombian military , just days after leaving home ?
" the doctor and the judge said that my son was killed in combat at 2.45am on march 5 , " one mother told deutsche welle .
" his corpse was clothed in camouflage and boots - completely different clothes from what he was wearing when he left . " " the investigations must examine everything , because this can not continue like this , " another anonymous mother from soacha told deutsche welle .

human rights campaigners suggest that over 2,000 young men were killed and buried in common graves as part of this policy . it is alleged that the kill bonus for units reporting higher enemy body counts , introduced by uribe 's administration in 2005 as part of its intensifying offensive against farc , contributed to the practise of abducting civilians and executing them as rebels .

meanwhile , president sarkozy is to appear on tv to try to quell a political funding scandal . french financial investigators have cleared the country 's labor minister , eric woerth , of accusations that he helped the l 'oreal billionaire liliane bettencourt to evade taxes .
the findings came as welcome news for french president nicolas sarkozy , whose government has been rocked in recent weeks by a scandal over political donations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aims to prevent further embarassment for his government france 's general financial inspection office -lrb- igf -rrb- said woerth did not use his powers while serving as budget minister to prevent the tax affairs of bettencourt from being investigated .
" during the period when he was budget minister , woerth did not intervene in the services under his authority to demand , prevent or influence a decision or an inspection affecting mrs. bettencourt , " read a statement issued by the french finance ministry , which presides over the igf , on sunday .
however questions remain about woerth 's role as treasurer of sarkozy 's ump , in alleged illegal donations to the party and his links to bettencourt .
conflict of interest ?
the politician , whose wife worked for a company managing bettencourt 's estate , has been accused of having a conflict of interest .
a former accountant for bettencourt alleged last week that woerth had been given 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 190,000 -rrb- from the 87-year-old heiress as a donation for sarkozy 's presidential campaign in 2007 , a sum far above than the legal limit .
separate investigations have been opened into those allegations , as well as bettencourt 's financial affairs .
sarkozy is to appear on television on monday evening to talk about the scandal for the first time .
the appearance comes as woerth prepares to launch a controversial pensions bill on tuesday , a central plank of sarkozy 's reform agenda ahead of elections in 2012 .

" the war against farc was the basis for all uribe 's government decisions .
if there was unemployment , farc was to blame for it .
if there were ' false positives ' then farc was to blame for it .
if there were paramilitaries , then farc was to blame for it .
all these arguments have worn themselves out . " with santos unlikely to swerve from uribe 's course of hunting and destroying farc rebels in the jungles of colombia once he becomes president , the memories of what happened in the early years of the operation are unlikely to dissipate .
the anticipated investigations and hearings during this month 's un human rights council session will also keep the topic in the public domain . author : nick amies / gottfried stein editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the team 's refreshing brand of offensive soccer inspired fans of the sport worldwide and made many rethink the way they perceive not only german football , but also germany itself .
germany repeated its placing from 2006 , the tournament it hosted , by prevailing 3-2 over a determined uruguay team in saturday 's match for third place .
" we 're not going back home to germany empty-handed , but with a third place finish , which the team has earned , " said national team head coach joachim loew , the architect of germany 's 2010 showing .
during the 2006 world cup , germany showed itself as a friendly and cosmopolitan country , and the event was widely regarded as an overwhelming success from both the organizational and entertainment points of view .
this year , the national team earned the world 's respect with its exciting , high-scoring style of football .
" abroad , this team is perceived as being very likeable , " said newly elected german president christian wulff , who flew to south africa to watch his country play uruguay .
" some africans have told me this team is something of a ' rainbow ' team , diverse and convincing , " he said .
the stirring performance has even led to a recommendation by wulff that loew receive the federal cross of merit for service to the nation , and that the team be awarded the silver bay laurel leaf , the highest sports award in germany .
" the team is the best ambassador germany has in the world , " wulff added .
german soccer legend franz beckenbauer also praised the national team .
" the mood in south africa was euphoric , and many people have told me that the german team has been the best , " he said .
national team manager and former striker oliver bierhoff gleaned a similarly positive message from the tournament .
" we have managed to create a new picture of germany , not only in a sporting sense , but also socially , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany 's young , multicultural squad celebrated a second consecutive third place finish youthful team shines without ballack the sense of just how much bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm , thomas mueller and co. have changed the way germany is perceived can not be overstated .
no longer will there be comparisons between the national team and tanks , but rather respect and recognition for what was regarded as a thrilling and youthful way of playing football .
" in my opinion this is the best team with the most quality of all the national teams i 've played on up until now , " said lahm , who was given the captain 's armband for the tournament in the absence of the injured michael ballack .
the loss of ballack , germany 's lone yet aging superstar , caused a lot of stress among german fans in the weeks leading up to the world cup .
but the absence of the new bayer leverkusen midfielder turned out to be an opportunity for the national team to reinvent itself .
ballack said he was watching with amazement as his young countrymen put in some memorable performances in south africa , particularly the 4-0 thrashing of diego maradona 's argentina .
" it 's scary that such a young team could take a classy team like argentina , " he said .
goals galore germany also put in great performances against australia , england and uruguay , though group stage games against serbia and ghana left a little to be desired .
the team finished with a goal tally of 16 over seven games , having conceded five .
what 's more , mueller , 20 , picked up the golden boot award with five of those goals and three assists .
mueller also took the award for best young player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semifinal disappointment soon turned to third-place pride for german fans after slotting home eight goals in two games against england and argentina , many pundits were tipping germany to go all the way , but the eventual champions spain proved an insurmountable obstacle .
the swedish newspaper aftonbladet summed up germany 's 1-0 semifinal loss to la furia roja with this comment : " an attractive , young germany required two years -lrb- from the euro 2008 loss to spain -rrb- to rehearse its own variation of spectacular spanish football .
spain needed 90 minutes to show that the germans are not yet the finished product . "
this was a point touched on by schweinsteiger , who himself had an excellent world cup as assistant captain : " we have many young players , who have a big future ahead of them .
they have now gathered a lot of experience from their first tournament .
that is good for future tournaments . "
in addition to being young and relatively unknown outside of germany , the team has also been the subject of much attention due to its multicultural makeup .
eleven of the 23 players on the world cup squad , including mesut oezil , sami khedira and jerome boateng , have roots overseas .
bundesliga in focus with their strong performances in south africa , the german players have boosted their transfer values and fueled the rumor mill .
no day of the world cup went by without players being linked with europe 's top clubs .
mesut oezil in particular is hot property .
five clubs - fc barcelona , manchester city , manchester united , fc valencia and fc arsenal - have apparently expressed interest in securing the playmaker 's transfer from werder bremen .
schweinsteiger hopes , however , that the dazzling performances of the bundesliga players will have the reverse effect .
" we have done the bundesliga proud .
in the future , the biggest players will come to germany , " the midfielder speculated .
loew 's future still uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and his assistant hansi flick 's lucky sweaters took the side far even though a fourth world cup title ultimately eluded germany , loew earned brownie points as the architect of german football 's renaissance in the world 's eyes .
theo zwanziger , president of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , wants to keep the national coach in the job .
" you can trust that i will do everything in my power to make sure that the coaching staff can take this team into the future , " he said .
yet the coach himself has kept a low profile so far .
it still apparently frustrates him that contract talks with the dfb broke down before the tournament .
" after the world cup , i need two or three days to get my thoughts in order .
and then i will certainly have several ideas and visions on how to go on further , " loew said .
he already has the next goal clearly in his sights .
by the 2012 european championship in poland and ukraine , or at the latest at the 2014 world cup in brazil , he wants to win a title .
philipp lahm is also confident about success in the future .
" as you have already seen at past tournaments , we are always in the running for the title , " he said .

but to win the ever-elusive big one , the spaniards had to change their style . spain 's ugly 1-0 triumph over the netherlands in johannesburg on sunday was a match most neutral football fans will want to forget as soon as possible .
but the way the spanish claimed the title is truly memorable .
spain scored only eight goals in seven matches , winning each of their four knock-out stage games by a score of 1-0 and setting a new record for the fewest tallies ever by a winner .
to put the numbers in perspective : all previous teams that lifted the trophy scored at least 11 goals .
and in this tournament , third-placed germany found the back of the net twice as often as the spaniards .
indeed , the netherlands , argentina , brazil and even uruguay were more potent offensively than coach vicente del bosque 's men .
with so many of their games coming down to the wire , luck clearly played a role in spain 's first-ever world cup triumph .
but was it accidental ?
not at all .
squad with a flaw bildunterschrift : torres was unable to make a meaningful contribution spain rightly rolled into south africa as one of the pre-tournament favorites .
they were the reigning european champions , having scored 12 goals in 6 matches on their way to the 2008 title and being blessed with a starting midfield drawn exclusively from powerhouses barcelona and real madrid .
but the squad contained a potentially fatal flaw .
striker fernando torres , who was coming off knee surgery , proved to be a shadow of his normal self , rarely capable of getting behind defenses and unable to turn on the ball when he did .
that essentially left spain without an effective center forward , a crucial element in what had been the squad 's free-flowing attack .
the spanish survived the group stage , thanks largely to striker david villa 's individual brilliance , but at that point many people were writing them off .
there was no question that the midfield , anchored by the exceptional xavi and iniesta , would dominate possession and frustrate opponents with their short passing .
but how could spain win if there was no one big up front to serve as a target man ?
strategic adjustment bildunterschrift : villa came up huge the answer lay in a clever , if unorthodox tactical change .
del bosque went even smaller .
villa - whose official height is listed at 1.75 meters -lrb- 5 ' 9 " -rrb- - replaced torres in the middle , while the hole in the squad was filled by diminutive wingers pedro and jesus navas .
the result was something that oddly resembled an italian catenaccio .
spain were n't packing it in at the back , however , as much as they were playing keep-away just inside their opponents ' half .
that made spain less incisive going forward - villa scored the last of his 5 goals -lrb- putting away a rebound off the goalpost -rrb- in the spaniards ' quarterfinal against paraguay .
but the adjustment also put the focus of spain 's remaining matches even more squarely on the midfield , where del bosque had his biggest advantage .
germany and the netherlands ran themselves ragged trying to win the ball back , while spain waited and waited for gaps to open up .
boring , a lot of football fans thought .
but effective .
in every one of their games , spain not only had more possession , but more shots on target than their opponents .
the end of national styles bildunterschrift : xavi , xabi alonso and iniesta anchored a superlative midfield one thing that this world cup made clear in that cliches about how various national teams play the game are in need of serious revision .
historically , spain were always a team that scored a lot and did n't get very far in the world cup .
the spanish teams of 1986 , 1994 and 2002 were twice as productive offensively than the 2010 squad - all were knocked out in the quarterfinals .
the current , more tactically disciplined team is built around an axis of players from barcelona , a club that was for the better part of 11 years -lrb- 1997-2008 -rrb- coached by two dutchmen , louis van gaal and frank rijkaard .
and it was n't just spain that defied stereotypes .
the most attractive offensive team in south africa , germany , featured seven field players from bayern munich , which is now of course coached by van gaal .
conversely , the netherlands came very close to taking this year 's title by abandoning " total football " for a rough-and-tumble style reminiscent of german teams of the past .
their coach bert van marwijk spent two-and-a-half years at bundesliga club borussia dortmund , and the embodiment of the new " tough dutch " style , defensive midfielder mark van bommel , is a barcelona veteran and current mainstay at bayern .
twenty years ago , it would have been unthinkable for the dutch and spanish to sacrifice the beautiful aspect of the beautiful game for results - or that germany would take spectators breaths away with technical acumen and inspiration .
but in the modern , internationalized game , anything is possible .
and that 's a key reason why the former perennial underachievers , spain , hoisted their first world cup trophy on sunday .

he said the cars , which have been cruising the world 's streets taking photos for google 's online mapping service for the past few years , would no longer collect any wi-fi information at all .
mcclendon insisted that they will now only collect photographs and 3d imagery , essential for street view , which he considers invaluable for people looking for a hotel or restaurant or to check out a new home .
not on german turf but the snap-happy cars will remain conspicuously absent in germany , which is famed for its particularly strict data protection laws , adopted after world war ii in a bid to keep personal information out of the public sphere .
in response to google 's erroneous street view data collection system , berlin 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has drawn up draft legislation to further tighten data protection .

companies such as google , seeking to use street level images , would be bound to contact the relevant data protection official three months before any systematic filming was carried out .
failure to comply with the new rules would result in fines of up to 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 377,00 -rrb- .
the proposed legislation is as controversial as the map service itself , with president of germany 's federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media , august-wilhelm scheer , calling it " political activism " .

leading members of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their junior partners , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- ended months of intense debate on tuesday of last week when they agreed on a compromise to fill next year 's 11-billion euro -lrb- $ 13.95 billion -rrb- gap in healthcare funding .
a major provision in the bill , crafted by health minister philipp roesler , would raise the mandatory health insurance premium , which is shared by employers and employees , to 15.5 percent of wages , up from the current 14.9 percent .
horst seehofer , leader of the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , told public broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur that the reform may only last a few years .
he added that he could only breathe easily when politicians say : " we have now found long-term funding , and it 's going to last . "

the rifts over healthcare come at a time when merkel 's coalition has been losing support among the electorate .
a poll conducted earlier this month for public broadcaster ard showed that 79 percent of respondents were either " less satisfied " or " not at all satisfied " with the work of the government .
in addition , both business lobbies and trade unions have voiced their disapproval for the bill .

without naming specific military officers , retired general giora eiland told reporters in tel aviv on monday that " mistakes were made in the various decisions taken , including within relatively senior ranks , which contributed to the result not being as we would have wished . "
eiland led an internal investigation into the may 31 raid of a turkish-owned flotilla carrying aid supplies to the gaza strip , which israel has largely sealed off because it is controlled by the radical islamist and anti-israel group hamas .
passengers of the boat attacked the israeli soldiers as they landed , and the soldiers opened fire on the crowd , killing eight turkish citizens and one turkish-american dual citizen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raid occurred off the gaza strip in international waters the eiland committee was israel 's response to a global backlash against israel and calls for an international probe .
israel decided to conduct its own investigation instead .
intelligence errors despite its admission of mistakes , the investigation cleared the commandos who conducted the raid of any wrongdoing and said their use of live fire was " justified " because their lives were in danger .
chief of staff gabi ashkenazi said in a statement that the probe found no evidence of " negligence . "
" neither i nor the investigating team detected any omission or negligence , but certainly , in an investigation as thorough as this , errors were found which must be corrected in the future , " he said .

sarkozy is to appear on television on monday evening to talk about the scandal for the first time .
the appearance comes as woerth prepares to launch a controversial pensions bill on tuesday , a central plank of sarkozy 's reform agenda ahead of elections in 2012 .

the trial was fiercely criticized by human rights activists .
art expert andrei yerofeyev and former museum director yury samodurov had set up the forbidden art exhibition at the andrei sakharov museum of moscow in 2007 , a museum devoted to the former soviet dissident and nobel peace prize winner who died in 1989 .
museum of moscow in 2007 .
the show included a depiction of jesus christ with a mickey mouse head and a spoof coca-cola ad carrying the slogan , " this is my blood . "
the exhibition was condemned by the russian orthodox church .
an ultra-nationalist orthodox group filed a complaint , and prosecutors opened an investigation into the show .
the two men were subsequently charged with inciting religious hatred .
yerofeyev protested that the show was not deliberately anti-christian , but that it was simply a protest about cultural censorship .
" i thought that this would cause controversy with the ministry of culture and other institutions , " he told news agency afp ahead of the ruling .
" but not within the church or with fascists .
" society is sick .
it still has problems with its reflection in the mirror , art , " he added .
the judge found the men guilty , saying they had " committed actions aimed at inciting hatred . "
yerofeyev and samodurov could have been sentenced to up to three years in prison , but were instead ordered to pay fines of up to 200,000 rubles -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- .former museum director yury samodurov said the guilty verdict was a return to soviet or tsarist times : " from now on any exhibition that shows religious symbols in a non-religious context , expressing a non-relgious meaning , is forbidden .
it means the use of religious symbols in art is being seen as a crime against faith " , samodurov told deutsche welle .
last week 13 russian artists published an open letter to president dmitry medvedev asking him to end the trial .
they said a guilty verdict would be a " sentence for the whole of russian contemporary art " and " another step towards the introduction of cultural censorship . "

but who will make deutsche welle 's list of the best 11 in south africa ? the jury for deutsche welle 's top xi consisted of sports editor matt hermann , reporters nick amies and jefferson chase and a special guest .
this year , dw-tv moderator , political expert and renaissance man peter craven joined the fray .
the rules were simple .
four guys , each with one vote per position , come up with the super-duper starting lineup .
four being an even number , we also introduced a tiebreaker .
in case of two of more players being judged relatively equal , the one with the best hair got the nod .
so without any further ado , and staying with the hair theme , here are our picks .
diego and david bildunterschrift : at dw , we 're big fans of forlan peter made an impassioned plea for miroslav klose to be included , in response to jefferson arguing that a fair number of his 14 career world cup goals were tap-ins .
but ultimately , miro had to take a back seat to two of the best players of the tournament .
the first is diego forlan , the uruguay forward who was deservedly named the world cup mvp .
as matt putt it , " he played on a defensively minded team that offered only intermittent support and was the heart and soul throughout . "
normally , we hate football players with loads of talent and swept-back , movie-star blond locks .
but forlan also seemed like a genuinely nice guy when interviewed and played in the true spirit of the beautiful game .
so diego , if you 're ever in berlin , bonn or brussels , we 'd like to buy you a beer .
slightly less likeable but no less prodigious was spain 's david villa .
the diminutive forward kept the spanish in the tournament when they stumbled early on and scored an outrageous goal from just inside the halfway line against chile .
plus he gets extra points for the frank zappa-esque goatee thing .
tommy , schweini , wesley and xavi bildunterschrift : twenty-year-old thomas mueller was the man against argentina the 2010 world cup was a midfielders ' tournament , and ghana 's kevin-prince boateng and japan 's honda drew kudos from the jury .
but ultimately there was consensus on who the middle four should be .
twenty-year-old thomas mueller made everyone 's list .
at an age where most young men 's greatest life achievement involves a fifth of jack daniel 's and a funnel , the german world cup debutant picked up the golden boot and , almost as an afterthought , the best young player award .
his teammate bastian schweinsteiger also swept our ballots for holding midfielder .
we were impressed not only with his presence in midfield but also his leadership qualities , which were one reason germany recovered so well from the loss of captain michael ballack to injury .
the netherlands ' wesley sneijder was a somewhat more curious case .
he never seemed to do anything all that spectacular but ended the world cup with five goals .
as nick put it , " he kind of embodies the dutch approach of players who are really talented and really mouthy - i like that . "
bildunterschrift : xavi is our midfield leader that left one big question : who to take from spain ?
the options , obviously , were xavi or iniesta , but that was like asking a hardcore radiohead fan to say whether " ok computer " or " kid a " is a better album .
iniesta scored two crucial goals , while xavi looked more like the true field general and delivered the pinpoint corner kick that propelled spain past germany .
in the end , xavi won on the hair rule .
iniesta has hardly any , while xavi 's michael corleone slick-back perfectly reflects his ruthless strategic acumen on the pitch .
king poodle and consorts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fine example of the hair rule in action left and right back were relatively easy choices .
spain may not have had the greatest offense , but sergio ramos attracted everyone 's votes for being a constant source of pressure up the left flank .
he was also solid defensively , as spain shut out their final four opponents .
meanwhile , maicon did on the right what ramos did on the left .
no opposing defense really had an answer for the burly brazilian , who is much bigger than most players at his position .
as peter succinctly put it , " the selecao disappointed ; maicon did not . "
selecting central defenders was harder , but we felt we had to pay tribute to new zealand 's ryan nelsen .
" he 's a player with limited gifts , but was at the heart of an amazing campaign , " matt pointed out .
" three games , 270 minutes of white-knuckle defending , one goal conceded .
class . "
we were all over the shop , though , when it came to picking nelsen 's partner .
among the candidates we looked at were friedrich , lugano , pique and lucio .
but in the end , one man stood out from the pack .
he 's been called the caveman and king poodle , but presumably never to his face .
spain 's carlos puyol has been around as long as any of us can remember , and his 2010 performance was as gritty , controlled and clutch as any he has ever turned in .
plus , he 's got the best hair since carlos valderrama .
bildunterschrift : stekelenburg was the netherlands ' flying dutchman who should be between the posts was an even tougher call .
the wacky world cup ball meant that the goalkeepers were pretty tentative , and little separated spain 's iker cassilas , germany 's manuel neuer and holland 's maarten stekelenburg .
but stekelenburg was our ultimate choice .
in nick 's words : " the dutch tended to panic in the last six meters before goal , and they were lucky they had such an agile , intelligent keeper who was on the ball . "
the netherlands would in fact have never made the finals had the lanky dutchman not diverted a short by kaka in their quarterfinal against brazil , when the selecao were leading 1-0 .
so we think he makes a fine addition to a cast of 11 that outshone all others in south africa .
so from all of us to all of you : nice work , guys .
and to carlos puyol in particular : love the hair .

but who will make deutsche welle 's list of the best 11 in south africa ? the jury for deutsche welle 's top xi consisted of sports editor matt hermann , reporters nick amies and jefferson chase and a special guest .
this year , dw-tv moderator , political expert and renaissance man peter craven joined the fray .
the rules were simple .
four guys , each with one vote per position , come up with the super-duper starting lineup .
four being an even number , we also introduced a tiebreaker .
in case of two of more players being judged relatively equal , the one with the best hair got the nod .
so without any further ado , and staying with the hair theme , here are our picks .
diego and david bildunterschrift : at dw , we 're big fans of forlan peter made an impassioned plea for miroslav klose to be included , in response to jefferson arguing that a fair number of his 14 career world cup goals were tap-ins .
but ultimately , miro had to take a back seat to two of the best players of the tournament .
the first is diego forlan , the uruguay forward who was deservedly named the world cup mvp .
as matt putt it , " he played on a defensively minded team that offered only intermittent support and was the heart and soul throughout . "
normally , we hate football players with loads of talent and swept-back , movie-star blond locks .
but forlan also seemed like a genuinely nice guy when interviewed and played in the true spirit of the beautiful game .
so diego , if you 're ever in berlin , bonn or brussels , we 'd like to buy you a beer .
slightly less likeable but no less prodigious was spain 's david villa .
the diminutive forward kept the spanish in the tournament when they stumbled early on and scored an outrageous goal from just inside the halfway line against chile .
plus he gets extra points for the frank zappa-esque goatee thing .
tommy , schweini , wesley and xavi bildunterschrift : twenty-year-old thomas mueller was the man against argentina the 2010 world cup was a midfielders ' tournament , and ghana 's kevin-prince boateng and japan 's honda drew kudos from the jury .
but ultimately there was consensus on who the middle four should be .
twenty-year-old thomas mueller made everyone 's list .
at an age where most young men 's greatest life achievement involves a fifth of jack daniel 's and a funnel , the german world cup debutant picked up the golden boot and , almost as an afterthought , the best young player award .
his teammate bastian schweinsteiger also swept our ballots for holding midfielder .
we were impressed not only with his presence in midfield but also his leadership qualities , which were one reason germany recovered so well from the loss of captain michael ballack to injury .
the netherlands ' wesley sneijder was a somewhat more curious case .
he never seemed to do anything all that spectacular but ended the world cup with five goals .
as nick put it , " he kind of embodies the dutch approach of players who are really talented and really mouthy - i like that . "
bildunterschrift : xavi is our midfield leader that left one big question : who to take from spain ?
the options , obviously , were xavi or iniesta , but that was like asking a hardcore radiohead fan to say whether " ok computer " or " kid a " is a better album .
iniesta scored two crucial goals , while xavi looked more like the true field general and delivered the pinpoint corner kick that propelled spain past germany .
in the end , xavi won on the hair rule .
iniesta has hardly any , while xavi 's michael corleone slick-back perfectly reflects his ruthless strategic acumen on the pitch .
king poodle and consorts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fine example of the hair rule in action left and right back were relatively easy choices .
spain may not have had the greatest offense , but sergio ramos attracted everyone 's votes for being a constant source of pressure up the left flank .
he was also solid defensively , as spain shut out their final four opponents .
meanwhile , maicon did on the right what ramos did on the left .
no opposing defense really had an answer for the burly brazilian , who is much bigger than most players at his position .
as peter succinctly put it , " the selecao disappointed ; maicon did not . "
selecting central defenders was harder , but we felt we had to pay tribute to new zealand 's ryan nelsen .
" he 's a player with limited gifts , but was at the heart of an amazing campaign , " matt pointed out .
" three games , 270 minutes of white-knuckle defending , one goal conceded .
class . "
we were all over the shop , though , when it came to picking nelsen 's partner .
among the candidates we looked at were friedrich , lugano , pique and lucio .
but in the end , one man stood out from the pack .
he 's been called the caveman and king poodle , but presumably never to his face .
spain 's carlos puyol has been around as long as any of us can remember , and his 2010 performance was as gritty , controlled and clutch as any he has ever turned in .
plus , he 's got the best hair since carlos valderrama .
bildunterschrift : stekelenburg was the netherlands ' flying dutchman who should be between the posts was an even tougher call .
the wacky world cup ball meant that the goalkeepers were pretty tentative , and little separated spain 's iker cassilas , germany 's manuel neuer and holland 's maarten stekelenburg .
but stekelenburg was our ultimate choice .
in nick 's words : " the dutch tended to panic in the last six meters before goal , and they were lucky they had such an agile , intelligent keeper who was on the ball . "
the netherlands would in fact have never made the finals had the lanky dutchman not diverted a short by kaka in their quarterfinal against brazil , when the selecao were leading 1-0 .
so we think he makes a fine addition to a cast of 11 that outshone all others in south africa .
so from all of us to all of you : nice work , guys .
and to carlos puyol in particular : love the hair .

twenty-year-old thomas mueller made everyone 's list .
at an age where most young men 's greatest life achievement involves a fifth of jack daniel 's and a funnel , the german world cup debutant picked up the golden boot and , almost as an afterthought , the best young player award .
his teammate bastian schweinsteiger also swept our ballots for holding midfielder .
we were impressed not only with his presence in midfield but also his leadership qualities , which were one reason germany recovered so well from the loss of captain michael ballack to injury .
the netherlands ' wesley sneijder was a somewhat more curious case .
he never seemed to do anything all that spectacular but ended the world cup with five goals .
as nick put it , " he kind of embodies the dutch approach of players who are really talented and really mouthy - i like that . "
bildunterschrift : xavi is our midfield leader that left one big question : who to take from spain ?
the options , obviously , were xavi or iniesta , but that was like asking a hardcore radiohead fan to say whether " ok computer " or " kid a " is a better album .
iniesta scored two crucial goals , while xavi looked more like the true field general and delivered the pinpoint corner kick that propelled spain past germany .
in the end , xavi won on the hair rule .
iniesta has hardly any , while xavi 's michael corleone slick-back perfectly reflects his ruthless strategic acumen on the pitch .
king poodle and consorts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fine example of the hair rule in action left and right back were relatively easy choices .
spain may not have had the greatest offense , but sergio ramos attracted everyone 's votes for being a constant source of pressure up the left flank .
he was also solid defensively , as spain shut out their final four opponents .
meanwhile , maicon did on the right what ramos did on the left .
no opposing defense really had an answer for the burly brazilian , who is much bigger than most players at his position .
as peter succinctly put it , " the selecao disappointed ; maicon did not . "
selecting central defenders was harder , but we felt we had to pay tribute to new zealand 's ryan nelsen .
" he 's a player with limited gifts , but was at the heart of an amazing campaign , " matt pointed out .
" three games , 270 minutes of white-knuckle defending , one goal conceded .
class . "
we were all over the shop , though , when it came to picking nelsen 's partner .
among the candidates we looked at were friedrich , lugano , pique and lucio .
but in the end , one man stood out from the pack .
he 's been called the caveman and king poodle , but presumably never to his face .
spain 's carlos puyol has been around as long as any of us can remember , and his 2010 performance was as gritty , controlled and clutch as any he has ever turned in .
plus , he 's got the best hair since carlos valderrama .
bildunterschrift : stekelenburg was the netherlands ' flying dutchman who should be between the posts was an even tougher call .
the wacky world cup ball meant that the goalkeepers were pretty tentative , and little separated spain 's iker cassilas , germany 's manuel neuer and holland 's maarten stekelenburg .
but stekelenburg was our ultimate choice .
in nick 's words : " the dutch tended to panic in the last six meters before goal , and they were lucky they had such an agile , intelligent keeper who was on the ball . "
the netherlands would in fact have never made the finals had the lanky dutchman not diverted a short by kaka in their quarterfinal against brazil , when the selecao were leading 1-0 .
so we think he makes a fine addition to a cast of 11 that outshone all others in south africa .
so from all of us to all of you : nice work , guys .
and to carlos puyol in particular : love the hair .

but who will make deutsche welle 's list of the best 11 in south africa ? the jury for deutsche welle 's top xi consisted of sports editor matt hermann , reporters nick amies and jefferson chase and a special guest .
this year , dw-tv moderator , political expert and renaissance man peter craven joined the fray .
the rules were simple .
four guys , each with one vote per position , come up with the super-duper starting lineup .
four being an even number , we also introduced a tiebreaker .
in case of two of more players being judged relatively equal , the one with the best hair got the nod .
so without any further ado , and staying with the hair theme , here are our picks .
diego and david bildunterschrift : at dw , we 're big fans of forlan peter made an impassioned plea for miroslav klose to be included , in response to jefferson arguing that a fair number of his 14 career world cup goals were tap-ins .
but ultimately , miro had to take a back seat to two of the best players of the tournament .
the first is diego forlan , the uruguay forward who was deservedly named the world cup mvp .
as matt putt it , " he played on a defensively minded team that offered only intermittent support and was the heart and soul throughout . "
normally , we hate football players with loads of talent and swept-back , movie-star blond locks .
but forlan also seemed like a genuinely nice guy when interviewed and played in the true spirit of the beautiful game .
so diego , if you 're ever in berlin , bonn or brussels , we 'd like to buy you a beer .
slightly less likeable but no less prodigious was spain 's david villa .
the diminutive forward kept the spanish in the tournament when they stumbled early on and scored an outrageous goal from just inside the halfway line against chile .
plus he gets extra points for the frank zappa-esque goatee thing .

the team 's refreshing brand of offensive soccer inspired fans of the sport worldwide and made many rethink the way they perceive not only german football , but also germany itself .
germany repeated its placing from 2006 , the tournament it hosted , by prevailing 3-2 over a determined uruguay team in saturday 's match for third place .
" we 're not going back home to germany empty-handed , but with a third place finish , which the team has earned , " said national team head coach joachim loew , the architect of germany 's 2010 showing .
during the 2006 world cup , germany showed itself as a friendly and cosmopolitan country , and the event was widely regarded as an overwhelming success from both the organizational and entertainment points of view .
this year , the national team earned the world 's respect with its exciting , high-scoring style of football .
" abroad , this team is perceived as being very likeable , " said newly elected german president christian wulff , who flew to south africa to watch his country play uruguay .
" some africans have told me this team is something of a ' rainbow ' team , diverse and convincing , " he said .
the stirring performance has even led to a recommendation by wulff that loew receive the federal cross of merit for service to the nation , and that the team be awarded the silver bay laurel leaf , the highest sports award in germany .
" the team is the best ambassador germany has in the world , " wulff added .
german soccer legend franz beckenbauer also praised the national team .
" the mood in south africa was euphoric , and many people have told me that the german team has been the best , " he said .
national team manager and former striker oliver bierhoff gleaned a similarly positive message from the tournament .
" we have managed to create a new picture of germany , not only in a sporting sense , but also socially , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany 's young , multicultural squad celebrated a second consecutive third place finish youthful team shines without ballack the sense of just how much bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm , thomas mueller and co. have changed the way germany is perceived can not be overstated .
no longer will there be comparisons between the national team and tanks , but rather respect and recognition for what was regarded as a thrilling and youthful way of playing football .
" in my opinion this is the best team with the most quality of all the national teams i 've played on up until now , " said lahm , who was given the captain 's armband for the tournament in the absence of the injured michael ballack .
the loss of ballack , germany 's lone yet aging superstar , caused a lot of stress among german fans in the weeks leading up to the world cup .
but the absence of the new bayer leverkusen midfielder turned out to be an opportunity for the national team to reinvent itself .
ballack said he was watching with amazement as his young countrymen put in some memorable performances in south africa , particularly the 4-0 thrashing of diego maradona 's argentina .
" it 's scary that such a young team could take a classy team like argentina , " he said .
goals galore germany also put in great performances against australia , england and uruguay , though group stage games against serbia and ghana left a little to be desired .
the team finished with a goal tally of 16 over seven games , having conceded five .
what 's more , mueller , 20 , picked up the golden boot award with five of those goals and three assists .
mueller also took the award for best young player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semifinal disappointment soon turned to third-place pride for german fans after slotting home eight goals in two games against england and argentina , many pundits were tipping germany to go all the way , but the eventual champions spain proved an insurmountable obstacle .
the swedish newspaper aftonbladet summed up germany 's 1-0 semifinal loss to la furia roja with this comment : " an attractive , young germany required two years -lrb- from the euro 2008 loss to spain -rrb- to rehearse its own variation of spectacular spanish football .
spain needed 90 minutes to show that the germans are not yet the finished product . "
this was a point touched on by schweinsteiger , who himself had an excellent world cup as assistant captain : " we have many young players , who have a big future ahead of them .
they have now gathered a lot of experience from their first tournament .
that is good for future tournaments . "
in addition to being young and relatively unknown outside of germany , the team has also been the subject of much attention due to its multicultural makeup .
eleven of the 23 players on the world cup squad , including mesut oezil , sami khedira and jerome boateng , have roots overseas .
bundesliga in focus with their strong performances in south africa , the german players have boosted their transfer values and fueled the rumor mill .
no day of the world cup went by without players being linked with europe 's top clubs .
mesut oezil in particular is hot property .
five clubs - fc barcelona , manchester city , manchester united , fc valencia and fc arsenal - have apparently expressed interest in securing the playmaker 's transfer from werder bremen .
schweinsteiger hopes , however , that the dazzling performances of the bundesliga players will have the reverse effect .
" we have done the bundesliga proud .
in the future , the biggest players will come to germany , " the midfielder speculated .
loew 's future still uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and his assistant hansi flick 's lucky sweaters took the side far even though a fourth world cup title ultimately eluded germany , loew earned brownie points as the architect of german football 's renaissance in the world 's eyes .
theo zwanziger , president of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , wants to keep the national coach in the job .
" you can trust that i will do everything in my power to make sure that the coaching staff can take this team into the future , " he said .
yet the coach himself has kept a low profile so far .
it still apparently frustrates him that contract talks with the dfb broke down before the tournament .
" after the world cup , i need two or three days to get my thoughts in order .
and then i will certainly have several ideas and visions on how to go on further , " loew said .
he already has the next goal clearly in his sights .
by the 2012 european championship in poland and ukraine , or at the latest at the 2014 world cup in brazil , he wants to win a title .
philipp lahm is also confident about success in the future .
" as you have already seen at past tournaments , we are always in the running for the title , " he said .

but in a televised interview on monday , he staunchly defended himself and his allies . appearing in an interview on national television monday night , french president nicolas sarkozy defended his scandal-stricken minister of labor and social affairs eric woerth and called for a conflict of interest inquiry to put to rest the criticism that has ensued .
" eric woerth is an honest man , a competent man , " sarkozy told france 2 television .
" he enjoys my full confidence . "
sarkozy has been hit by a campaign finance scandal surrounding woerth , in which a former accountant of billionaire l 'oreal heiress liliane bettencourt accused him of accepting an illegal 150,000 euro -lrb- $ 190,000 -rrb- donation for sarkozy 's election campaign in 2007 .
the accountant also accused bettencourt and her late husband of making several other illegal donations to conservative politicians .

all government officials must report their personal details such as income , assets and the whereabouts of their family members , state media said .
the move is a fresh attempt by the chinese government to combat endemic graft . the new rules went into effect on sunday .
they apply to all officials in government posts , political parties and state-owned companies , according to the china daily .
under the rules , the officials are required to report their salary , income from other sources , property owned by them and their family members and investments .
officials are also required to inform the authorities of changes in marital status and the occupations of their spouses and children spouses and children .
officials in china have a long history of hiding their illicit incomes under the names of spouses or other relatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the officials are now required to report their salary and income from other sources punishment for defaulters the state media said those officials who failed to follow the new rules would face punishment ranging from criticism of their conduct to dismissal .
but , as the china daily reported , the new rules fall short of requiring that the income and assets of chinese officials be made public .
the new rules were issued jointly by the state council , china 's cabinet and the ruling communist party .
they are an expansion of regulations adopted in 1995 and 2006 .
the move comes amid increasing complains by ordinary chinese citizens about growing official corruption .
tackling graft is crucial for the communist party , which sees it as a major threat to political stability. du / afp / ap editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spain lifts first world cup , beating the netherlands world cup -pipe- 12.07.2010 spain 's win down to possession , not goals großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only three spain players scored at this year 's world cup by adding the 2010 world cup to their 2008 euro title , the furia roja cemented their place in soccer history .
but to win the ever-elusive big one , the spaniards had to change their style . spain 's ugly 1-0 triumph over the netherlands in johannesburg on sunday was a match most neutral football fans will want to forget as soon as possible .
but the way the spanish claimed the title is truly memorable .
spain scored only eight goals in seven matches , winning each of their four knock-out stage games by a score of 1-0 and setting a new record for the fewest tallies ever by a winner .
to put the numbers in perspective : all previous teams that lifted the trophy scored at least 11 goals .
and in this tournament , third-placed germany found the back of the net twice as often as the spaniards .
indeed , the netherlands , argentina , brazil and even uruguay were more potent offensively than coach vicente del bosque 's men .
with so many of their games coming down to the wire , luck clearly played a role in spain 's first-ever world cup triumph .
but was it accidental ?
not at all .
squad with a flaw bildunterschrift : torres was unable to make a meaningful contribution spain rightly rolled into south africa as one of the pre-tournament favorites .
they were the reigning european champions , having scored 12 goals in 6 matches on their way to the 2008 title and being blessed with a starting midfield drawn exclusively from powerhouses barcelona and real madrid .
but the squad contained a potentially fatal flaw .
striker fernando torres , who was coming off knee surgery , proved to be a shadow of his normal self , rarely capable of getting behind defenses and unable to turn on the ball when he did .
that essentially left spain without an effective center forward , a crucial element in what had been the squad 's free-flowing attack .
the spanish survived the group stage , thanks largely to striker david villa 's individual brilliance , but at that point many people were writing them off .
there was no question that the midfield , anchored by the exceptional xavi and iniesta , would dominate possession and frustrate opponents with their short passing .
but how could spain win if there was no one big up front to serve as a target man ?
strategic adjustment bildunterschrift : villa came up huge the answer lay in a clever , if unorthodox tactical change .
del bosque went even smaller .
villa - whose official height is listed at 1.75 meters -lrb- 5 ' 9 " -rrb- - replaced torres in the middle , while the hole in the squad was filled by diminutive wingers pedro and jesus navas .
the result was something that oddly resembled an italian catenaccio .
spain were n't packing it in at the back , however , as much as they were playing keep-away just inside their opponents ' half .
that made spain less incisive going forward - villa scored the last of his 5 goals -lrb- putting away a rebound off the goalpost -rrb- in the spaniards ' quarterfinal against paraguay .
but the adjustment also put the focus of spain 's remaining matches even more squarely on the midfield , where del bosque had his biggest advantage .
germany and the netherlands ran themselves ragged trying to win the ball back , while spain waited and waited for gaps to open up .
boring , a lot of football fans thought .
but effective .

but the way the spanish claimed the title is truly memorable .
spain scored only eight goals in seven matches , winning each of their four knock-out stage games by a score of 1-0 and setting a new record for the fewest tallies ever by a winner .
to put the numbers in perspective : all previous teams that lifted the trophy scored at least 11 goals .

they were the reigning european champions , having scored 12 goals in 6 matches on their way to the 2008 title and being blessed with a starting midfield drawn exclusively from powerhouses barcelona and real madrid .
but the squad contained a potentially fatal flaw .
striker fernando torres , who was coming off knee surgery , proved to be a shadow of his normal self , rarely capable of getting behind defenses and unable to turn on the ball when he did .
that essentially left spain without an effective center forward , a crucial element in what had been the squad 's free-flowing attack .
the spanish survived the group stage , thanks largely to striker david villa 's individual brilliance , but at that point many people were writing them off .
there was no question that the midfield , anchored by the exceptional xavi and iniesta , would dominate possession and frustrate opponents with their short passing .
but how could spain win if there was no one big up front to serve as a target man ?
strategic adjustment bildunterschrift : villa came up huge the answer lay in a clever , if unorthodox tactical change .
del bosque went even smaller .
villa - whose official height is listed at 1.75 meters -lrb- 5 ' 9 " -rrb- - replaced torres in the middle , while the hole in the squad was filled by diminutive wingers pedro and jesus navas .
the result was something that oddly resembled an italian catenaccio .
spain were n't packing it in at the back , however , as much as they were playing keep-away just inside their opponents ' half .
that made spain less incisive going forward - villa scored the last of his 5 goals -lrb- putting away a rebound off the goalpost -rrb- in the spaniards ' quarterfinal against paraguay .
but the adjustment also put the focus of spain 's remaining matches even more squarely on the midfield , where del bosque had his biggest advantage .

the team 's refreshing brand of offensive soccer inspired fans of the sport worldwide and made many rethink the way they perceive not only german football , but also germany itself .
germany repeated its placing from 2006 , the tournament it hosted , by prevailing 3-2 over a determined uruguay team in saturday 's match for third place .
" we 're not going back home to germany empty-handed , but with a third place finish , which the team has earned , " said national team head coach joachim loew , the architect of germany 's 2010 showing .
during the 2006 world cup , germany showed itself as a friendly and cosmopolitan country , and the event was widely regarded as an overwhelming success from both the organizational and entertainment points of view .
this year , the national team earned the world 's respect with its exciting , high-scoring style of football .
" abroad , this team is perceived as being very likeable , " said newly elected german president christian wulff , who flew to south africa to watch his country play uruguay .
" some africans have told me this team is something of a ' rainbow ' team , diverse and convincing , " he said .
the stirring performance has even led to a recommendation by wulff that loew receive the federal cross of merit for service to the nation , and that the team be awarded the silver bay laurel leaf , the highest sports award in germany .
" the team is the best ambassador germany has in the world , " wulff added .
german soccer legend franz beckenbauer also praised the national team .
" the mood in south africa was euphoric , and many people have told me that the german team has been the best , " he said .
national team manager and former striker oliver bierhoff gleaned a similarly positive message from the tournament .
" we have managed to create a new picture of germany , not only in a sporting sense , but also socially , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany 's young , multicultural squad celebrated a second consecutive third place finish youthful team shines without ballack the sense of just how much bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm , thomas mueller and co. have changed the way germany is perceived can not be overstated .
no longer will there be comparisons between the national team and tanks , but rather respect and recognition for what was regarded as a thrilling and youthful way of playing football .
" in my opinion this is the best team with the most quality of all the national teams i 've played on up until now , " said lahm , who was given the captain 's armband for the tournament in the absence of the injured michael ballack .
the loss of ballack , germany 's lone yet aging superstar , caused a lot of stress among german fans in the weeks leading up to the world cup .
but the absence of the new bayer leverkusen midfielder turned out to be an opportunity for the national team to reinvent itself .
ballack said he was watching with amazement as his young countrymen put in some memorable performances in south africa , particularly the 4-0 thrashing of diego maradona 's argentina .
" it 's scary that such a young team could take a classy team like argentina , " he said .
goals galore germany also put in great performances against australia , england and uruguay , though group stage games against serbia and ghana left a little to be desired .
the team finished with a goal tally of 16 over seven games , having conceded five .
what 's more , mueller , 20 , picked up the golden boot award with five of those goals and three assists .
mueller also took the award for best young player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semifinal disappointment soon turned to third-place pride for german fans after slotting home eight goals in two games against england and argentina , many pundits were tipping germany to go all the way , but the eventual champions spain proved an insurmountable obstacle .
the swedish newspaper aftonbladet summed up germany 's 1-0 semifinal loss to la furia roja with this comment : " an attractive , young germany required two years -lrb- from the euro 2008 loss to spain -rrb- to rehearse its own variation of spectacular spanish football .
spain needed 90 minutes to show that the germans are not yet the finished product . "
this was a point touched on by schweinsteiger , who himself had an excellent world cup as assistant captain : " we have many young players , who have a big future ahead of them .
they have now gathered a lot of experience from their first tournament .
that is good for future tournaments . "
in addition to being young and relatively unknown outside of germany , the team has also been the subject of much attention due to its multicultural makeup .
eleven of the 23 players on the world cup squad , including mesut oezil , sami khedira and jerome boateng , have roots overseas .
bundesliga in focus with their strong performances in south africa , the german players have boosted their transfer values and fueled the rumor mill .
no day of the world cup went by without players being linked with europe 's top clubs .
mesut oezil in particular is hot property .
five clubs - fc barcelona , manchester city , manchester united , fc valencia and fc arsenal - have apparently expressed interest in securing the playmaker 's transfer from werder bremen .
schweinsteiger hopes , however , that the dazzling performances of the bundesliga players will have the reverse effect .
" we have done the bundesliga proud .
in the future , the biggest players will come to germany , " the midfielder speculated .
loew 's future still uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and his assistant hansi flick 's lucky sweaters took the side far even though a fourth world cup title ultimately eluded germany , loew earned brownie points as the architect of german football 's renaissance in the world 's eyes .
theo zwanziger , president of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , wants to keep the national coach in the job .
" you can trust that i will do everything in my power to make sure that the coaching staff can take this team into the future , " he said .
yet the coach himself has kept a low profile so far .
it still apparently frustrates him that contract talks with the dfb broke down before the tournament .
" after the world cup , i need two or three days to get my thoughts in order .
and then i will certainly have several ideas and visions on how to go on further , " loew said .
he already has the next goal clearly in his sights .
by the 2012 european championship in poland and ukraine , or at the latest at the 2014 world cup in brazil , he wants to win a title .
philipp lahm is also confident about success in the future .
" as you have already seen at past tournaments , we are always in the running for the title , " he said .

the team 's refreshing brand of offensive soccer inspired fans of the sport worldwide and made many rethink the way they perceive not only german football , but also germany itself .
germany repeated its placing from 2006 , the tournament it hosted , by prevailing 3-2 over a determined uruguay team in saturday 's match for third place .
" we 're not going back home to germany empty-handed , but with a third place finish , which the team has earned , " said national team head coach joachim loew , the architect of germany 's 2010 showing .
during the 2006 world cup , germany showed itself as a friendly and cosmopolitan country , and the event was widely regarded as an overwhelming success from both the organizational and entertainment points of view .
this year , the national team earned the world 's respect with its exciting , high-scoring style of football .
" abroad , this team is perceived as being very likeable , " said newly elected german president christian wulff , who flew to south africa to watch his country play uruguay .
" some africans have told me this team is something of a ' rainbow ' team , diverse and convincing , " he said .
the stirring performance has even led to a recommendation by wulff that loew receive the federal cross of merit for service to the nation , and that the team be awarded the silver bay laurel leaf , the highest sports award in germany .
" the team is the best ambassador germany has in the world , " wulff added .
german soccer legend franz beckenbauer also praised the national team .
" the mood in south africa was euphoric , and many people have told me that the german team has been the best , " he said .
national team manager and former striker oliver bierhoff gleaned a similarly positive message from the tournament .
" we have managed to create a new picture of germany , not only in a sporting sense , but also socially , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany 's young , multicultural squad celebrated a second consecutive third place finish youthful team shines without ballack the sense of just how much bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm , thomas mueller and co. have changed the way germany is perceived can not be overstated .
no longer will there be comparisons between the national team and tanks , but rather respect and recognition for what was regarded as a thrilling and youthful way of playing football .
" in my opinion this is the best team with the most quality of all the national teams i 've played on up until now , " said lahm , who was given the captain 's armband for the tournament in the absence of the injured michael ballack .
the loss of ballack , germany 's lone yet aging superstar , caused a lot of stress among german fans in the weeks leading up to the world cup .
but the absence of the new bayer leverkusen midfielder turned out to be an opportunity for the national team to reinvent itself .
ballack said he was watching with amazement as his young countrymen put in some memorable performances in south africa , particularly the 4-0 thrashing of diego maradona 's argentina .
" it 's scary that such a young team could take a classy team like argentina , " he said .
goals galore germany also put in great performances against australia , england and uruguay , though group stage games against serbia and ghana left a little to be desired .
the team finished with a goal tally of 16 over seven games , having conceded five .
what 's more , mueller , 20 , picked up the golden boot award with five of those goals and three assists .
mueller also took the award for best young player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semifinal disappointment soon turned to third-place pride for german fans after slotting home eight goals in two games against england and argentina , many pundits were tipping germany to go all the way , but the eventual champions spain proved an insurmountable obstacle .
the swedish newspaper aftonbladet summed up germany 's 1-0 semifinal loss to la furia roja with this comment : " an attractive , young germany required two years -lrb- from the euro 2008 loss to spain -rrb- to rehearse its own variation of spectacular spanish football .
spain needed 90 minutes to show that the germans are not yet the finished product . "
this was a point touched on by schweinsteiger , who himself had an excellent world cup as assistant captain : " we have many young players , who have a big future ahead of them .
they have now gathered a lot of experience from their first tournament .
that is good for future tournaments . "
in addition to being young and relatively unknown outside of germany , the team has also been the subject of much attention due to its multicultural makeup .
eleven of the 23 players on the world cup squad , including mesut oezil , sami khedira and jerome boateng , have roots overseas .
bundesliga in focus with their strong performances in south africa , the german players have boosted their transfer values and fueled the rumor mill .
no day of the world cup went by without players being linked with europe 's top clubs .
mesut oezil in particular is hot property .
five clubs - fc barcelona , manchester city , manchester united , fc valencia and fc arsenal - have apparently expressed interest in securing the playmaker 's transfer from werder bremen .
schweinsteiger hopes , however , that the dazzling performances of the bundesliga players will have the reverse effect .
" we have done the bundesliga proud .
in the future , the biggest players will come to germany , " the midfielder speculated .
loew 's future still uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and his assistant hansi flick 's lucky sweaters took the side far even though a fourth world cup title ultimately eluded germany , loew earned brownie points as the architect of german football 's renaissance in the world 's eyes .
theo zwanziger , president of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , wants to keep the national coach in the job .
" you can trust that i will do everything in my power to make sure that the coaching staff can take this team into the future , " he said .
yet the coach himself has kept a low profile so far .
it still apparently frustrates him that contract talks with the dfb broke down before the tournament .
" after the world cup , i need two or three days to get my thoughts in order .
and then i will certainly have several ideas and visions on how to go on further , " loew said .
he already has the next goal clearly in his sights .
by the 2012 european championship in poland and ukraine , or at the latest at the 2014 world cup in brazil , he wants to win a title .
philipp lahm is also confident about success in the future .
" as you have already seen at past tournaments , we are always in the running for the title , " he said .

but to win the ever-elusive big one , the spaniards had to change their style . spain 's ugly 1-0 triumph over the netherlands in johannesburg on sunday was a match most neutral football fans will want to forget as soon as possible .
but the way the spanish claimed the title is truly memorable .
spain scored only eight goals in seven matches , winning each of their four knock-out stage games by a score of 1-0 and setting a new record for the fewest tallies ever by a winner .
to put the numbers in perspective : all previous teams that lifted the trophy scored at least 11 goals .
and in this tournament , third-placed germany found the back of the net twice as often as the spaniards .
indeed , the netherlands , argentina , brazil and even uruguay were more potent offensively than coach vicente del bosque 's men .
with so many of their games coming down to the wire , luck clearly played a role in spain 's first-ever world cup triumph .
but was it accidental ?
not at all .
squad with a flaw bildunterschrift : torres was unable to make a meaningful contribution spain rightly rolled into south africa as one of the pre-tournament favorites .
they were the reigning european champions , having scored 12 goals in 6 matches on their way to the 2008 title and being blessed with a starting midfield drawn exclusively from powerhouses barcelona and real madrid .
but the squad contained a potentially fatal flaw .
striker fernando torres , who was coming off knee surgery , proved to be a shadow of his normal self , rarely capable of getting behind defenses and unable to turn on the ball when he did .
that essentially left spain without an effective center forward , a crucial element in what had been the squad 's free-flowing attack .
the spanish survived the group stage , thanks largely to striker david villa 's individual brilliance , but at that point many people were writing them off .
there was no question that the midfield , anchored by the exceptional xavi and iniesta , would dominate possession and frustrate opponents with their short passing .
but how could spain win if there was no one big up front to serve as a target man ?
strategic adjustment bildunterschrift : villa came up huge the answer lay in a clever , if unorthodox tactical change .
del bosque went even smaller .
villa - whose official height is listed at 1.75 meters -lrb- 5 ' 9 " -rrb- - replaced torres in the middle , while the hole in the squad was filled by diminutive wingers pedro and jesus navas .
the result was something that oddly resembled an italian catenaccio .
spain were n't packing it in at the back , however , as much as they were playing keep-away just inside their opponents ' half .
that made spain less incisive going forward - villa scored the last of his 5 goals -lrb- putting away a rebound off the goalpost -rrb- in the spaniards ' quarterfinal against paraguay .
but the adjustment also put the focus of spain 's remaining matches even more squarely on the midfield , where del bosque had his biggest advantage .
germany and the netherlands ran themselves ragged trying to win the ball back , while spain waited and waited for gaps to open up .
boring , a lot of football fans thought .
but effective .
in every one of their games , spain not only had more possession , but more shots on target than their opponents .
the end of national styles bildunterschrift : xavi , xabi alonso and iniesta anchored a superlative midfield one thing that this world cup made clear in that cliches about how various national teams play the game are in need of serious revision .
historically , spain were always a team that scored a lot and did n't get very far in the world cup .
the spanish teams of 1986 , 1994 and 2002 were twice as productive offensively than the 2010 squad - all were knocked out in the quarterfinals .
the current , more tactically disciplined team is built around an axis of players from barcelona , a club that was for the better part of 11 years -lrb- 1997-2008 -rrb- coached by two dutchmen , louis van gaal and frank rijkaard .
and it was n't just spain that defied stereotypes .
the most attractive offensive team in south africa , germany , featured seven field players from bayern munich , which is now of course coached by van gaal .
conversely , the netherlands came very close to taking this year 's title by abandoning " total football " for a rough-and-tumble style reminiscent of german teams of the past .
their coach bert van marwijk spent two-and-a-half years at bundesliga club borussia dortmund , and the embodiment of the new " tough dutch " style , defensive midfielder mark van bommel , is a barcelona veteran and current mainstay at bayern .
twenty years ago , it would have been unthinkable for the dutch and spanish to sacrifice the beautiful aspect of the beautiful game for results - or that germany would take spectators breaths away with technical acumen and inspiration .
but in the modern , internationalized game , anything is possible .
and that 's a key reason why the former perennial underachievers , spain , hoisted their first world cup trophy on sunday .

the trial was fiercely criticized by human rights activists .
art expert andrei yerofeyev and former museum director yury samodurov had set up the forbidden art exhibition at the andrei sakharov museum of moscow in 2007 , a museum devoted to the former soviet dissident and nobel peace prize winner who died in 1989 .
museum of moscow in 2007 .
the show included a depiction of jesus christ with a mickey mouse head and a spoof coca-cola ad carrying the slogan , " this is my blood . "
the exhibition was condemned by the russian orthodox church .
an ultra-nationalist orthodox group filed a complaint , and prosecutors opened an investigation into the show .
the two men were subsequently charged with inciting religious hatred .
yerofeyev protested that the show was not deliberately anti-christian , but that it was simply a protest about cultural censorship .
" i thought that this would cause controversy with the ministry of culture and other institutions , " he told news agency afp ahead of the ruling .
" but not within the church or with fascists .
" society is sick .
it still has problems with its reflection in the mirror , art , " he added .
the judge found the men guilty , saying they had " committed actions aimed at inciting hatred . "
yerofeyev and samodurov could have been sentenced to up to three years in prison , but were instead ordered to pay fines of up to 200,000 rubles -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- .former museum director yury samodurov said the guilty verdict was a return to soviet or tsarist times : " from now on any exhibition that shows religious symbols in a non-religious context , expressing a non-relgious meaning , is forbidden .
it means the use of religious symbols in art is being seen as a crime against faith " , samodurov told deutsche welle .
last week 13 russian artists published an open letter to president dmitry medvedev asking him to end the trial .
they said a guilty verdict would be a " sentence for the whole of russian contemporary art " and " another step towards the introduction of cultural censorship . "

forty-four passengers needed medical attention after travelling on a high-speed train with a broken air conditioning system . german police are investigating charges against rail operator deutsche bahn after 44 passengers needed medical attention after travelling on a high-speed train with a broken air conditioning system on the weekend .
near-panic broke out on board the ice train from berlin to cologne on saturday when several high-school students returning from a school trip collapsed and lay unconscious and dehydrated in the aisle .
the train was eventually stopped in the central german town of bielefeld .
" people were already collapsing in the train , and four of our students hyperventilated when they stepped out onto the platform , " said distressed teacher dagmar reichenberg-arnoldy , as emergency doctors attended to her class on the platform .
three trains were affected , nine students and elderly passengers ended up in hospital and a pregnant woman tried to smash a window with an emergency hammer in desperation .
with outside temperatures of up to 38 degrees celsius , a broken air-conditioning system and sealed windows , temperatures within reportedly reached up to 50 degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruediger grube promised compensation damage control deutsche bahn 's public relations department quickly attempted some damage control , with boss ruediger grube promising compensation .
spokesman juergen kornmann appealed for the public to put saturday 's events in perspective .
" we operate 1,400 inter-city connections every day , and yesterday we had problems - big problems i admit - on three of the trains , " he said .
" so one can see the vast majority of travelers arrive safely and comfortably . "
but these justifications have not prevented saturday 's events from catching the attention of the police , who announced that they have begun investigations into deutsche bahn on suspicion of causing bodily harm by negligence .
a police spokeswoman said the problem with the air-conditioning had been known well before the train was stopped in bielefeld .

meanwhile , passengers on other trains have since come forward to report problems on other trains .
oliver rasche , who was travelling on a stretch from bochum to berlin on saturday , complained about the way deutsche bahn handled the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temperature inside the train was estimated at 50 degrees celsius " there was no official reaction or official announcement at all that the train was damaged or that the air-conditioning was not working , " he said .
" you just realized it was getting hotter and hotter . "
dirty filters , causing the air-conditioning to overheat and shut itself down , have been blamed for the problems , and karl-peter naumann of public transport passenger organization pro bahn believes cost-cutting schemes in deutsche bahn 's maintenance department have caused endemic problems .
" i think that parts relevant to safety - the wheels and the axles - are being cared for very thoroughly , but i 'm afraid that means the air-conditioning system is neglected , " he told german broadcaster ntv .
if saturday 's dramatic events are traced to a lack of maintenance in on-board systems , deutsche bahn could face serious legal trouble .

but in a televised interview on monday , he staunchly defended himself and his allies . appearing in an interview on national television monday night , french president nicolas sarkozy defended his scandal-stricken minister of labor and social affairs eric woerth and called for a conflict of interest inquiry to put to rest the criticism that has ensued .
" eric woerth is an honest man , a competent man , " sarkozy told france 2 television .
" he enjoys my full confidence . "
sarkozy has been hit by a campaign finance scandal surrounding woerth , in which a former accountant of billionaire l 'oreal heiress liliane bettencourt accused him of accepting an illegal 150,000 euro -lrb- $ 190,000 -rrb- donation for sarkozy 's election campaign in 2007 .
the accountant also accused bettencourt and her late husband of making several other illegal donations to conservative politicians .
in the interview , sarkozy claimed that the scandal was timed to weaken his government as it prepares to embark on an ambitious and controversial reform of the nation 's pension scheme , which woerth is charged with leading .

they also searched the home of photographer francois-marie banier , whom bettencourt 's daughter has accused of taking advantage of the heiress ' frailty by taking gifts worth 1 billion euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 12.07.2010 russians convicted over forbidden art show großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organizers of the show said it was a protest against cultural censorship an art expert and a museum director were convicted by a moscow court on monday for inciting hatred , after they organized a provocative exhibition in the capital in 2007 , offending the russian orthodox church . two men who organized a controversial art exhibition in moscow were found guilty of inciting hatred by a russian court on monday , but the judge let them go free after ordering them to pay fines .
the trial was fiercely criticized by human rights activists .
art expert andrei yerofeyev and former museum director yury samodurov had set up the forbidden art exhibition at the andrei sakharov museum of moscow in 2007 , a museum devoted to the former soviet dissident and nobel peace prize winner who died in 1989 .
museum of moscow in 2007 .
the show included a depiction of jesus christ with a mickey mouse head and a spoof coca-cola ad carrying the slogan , " this is my blood . "
the exhibition was condemned by the russian orthodox church .
an ultra-nationalist orthodox group filed a complaint , and prosecutors opened an investigation into the show .
the two men were subsequently charged with inciting religious hatred .
yerofeyev protested that the show was not deliberately anti-christian , but that it was simply a protest about cultural censorship .
" i thought that this would cause controversy with the ministry of culture and other institutions , " he told news agency afp ahead of the ruling .
" but not within the church or with fascists .
" society is sick .
it still has problems with its reflection in the mirror , art , " he added .
the judge found the men guilty , saying they had " committed actions aimed at inciting hatred . "
yerofeyev and samodurov could have been sentenced to up to three years in prison , but were instead ordered to pay fines of up to 200,000 rubles -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- .former museum director yury samodurov said the guilty verdict was a return to soviet or tsarist times : " from now on any exhibition that shows religious symbols in a non-religious context , expressing a non-relgious meaning , is forbidden .
it means the use of religious symbols in art is being seen as a crime against faith " , samodurov told deutsche welle .
last week 13 russian artists published an open letter to president dmitry medvedev asking him to end the trial .

the team 's refreshing brand of offensive soccer inspired fans of the sport worldwide and made many rethink the way they perceive not only german football , but also germany itself .
germany repeated its placing from 2006 , the tournament it hosted , by prevailing 3-2 over a determined uruguay team in saturday 's match for third place .
" we 're not going back home to germany empty-handed , but with a third place finish , which the team has earned , " said national team head coach joachim loew , the architect of germany 's 2010 showing .
during the 2006 world cup , germany showed itself as a friendly and cosmopolitan country , and the event was widely regarded as an overwhelming success from both the organizational and entertainment points of view .
this year , the national team earned the world 's respect with its exciting , high-scoring style of football .
" abroad , this team is perceived as being very likeable , " said newly elected german president christian wulff , who flew to south africa to watch his country play uruguay .
" some africans have told me this team is something of a ' rainbow ' team , diverse and convincing , " he said .
the stirring performance has even led to a recommendation by wulff that loew receive the federal cross of merit for service to the nation , and that the team be awarded the silver bay laurel leaf , the highest sports award in germany .
" the team is the best ambassador germany has in the world , " wulff added .
german soccer legend franz beckenbauer also praised the national team .
" the mood in south africa was euphoric , and many people have told me that the german team has been the best , " he said .
national team manager and former striker oliver bierhoff gleaned a similarly positive message from the tournament .
" we have managed to create a new picture of germany , not only in a sporting sense , but also socially , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany 's young , multicultural squad celebrated a second consecutive third place finish youthful team shines without ballack the sense of just how much bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm , thomas mueller and co. have changed the way germany is perceived can not be overstated .
no longer will there be comparisons between the national team and tanks , but rather respect and recognition for what was regarded as a thrilling and youthful way of playing football .
" in my opinion this is the best team with the most quality of all the national teams i 've played on up until now , " said lahm , who was given the captain 's armband for the tournament in the absence of the injured michael ballack .
the loss of ballack , germany 's lone yet aging superstar , caused a lot of stress among german fans in the weeks leading up to the world cup .
but the absence of the new bayer leverkusen midfielder turned out to be an opportunity for the national team to reinvent itself .
ballack said he was watching with amazement as his young countrymen put in some memorable performances in south africa , particularly the 4-0 thrashing of diego maradona 's argentina .
" it 's scary that such a young team could take a classy team like argentina , " he said .
goals galore germany also put in great performances against australia , england and uruguay , though group stage games against serbia and ghana left a little to be desired .
the team finished with a goal tally of 16 over seven games , having conceded five .
what 's more , mueller , 20 , picked up the golden boot award with five of those goals and three assists .
mueller also took the award for best young player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semifinal disappointment soon turned to third-place pride for german fans after slotting home eight goals in two games against england and argentina , many pundits were tipping germany to go all the way , but the eventual champions spain proved an insurmountable obstacle .
the swedish newspaper aftonbladet summed up germany 's 1-0 semifinal loss to la furia roja with this comment : " an attractive , young germany required two years -lrb- from the euro 2008 loss to spain -rrb- to rehearse its own variation of spectacular spanish football .
spain needed 90 minutes to show that the germans are not yet the finished product . "
this was a point touched on by schweinsteiger , who himself had an excellent world cup as assistant captain : " we have many young players , who have a big future ahead of them .
they have now gathered a lot of experience from their first tournament .
that is good for future tournaments . "
in addition to being young and relatively unknown outside of germany , the team has also been the subject of much attention due to its multicultural makeup .
eleven of the 23 players on the world cup squad , including mesut oezil , sami khedira and jerome boateng , have roots overseas .
bundesliga in focus with their strong performances in south africa , the german players have boosted their transfer values and fueled the rumor mill .
no day of the world cup went by without players being linked with europe 's top clubs .
mesut oezil in particular is hot property .
five clubs - fc barcelona , manchester city , manchester united , fc valencia and fc arsenal - have apparently expressed interest in securing the playmaker 's transfer from werder bremen .
schweinsteiger hopes , however , that the dazzling performances of the bundesliga players will have the reverse effect .
" we have done the bundesliga proud .
in the future , the biggest players will come to germany , " the midfielder speculated .
loew 's future still uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and his assistant hansi flick 's lucky sweaters took the side far even though a fourth world cup title ultimately eluded germany , loew earned brownie points as the architect of german football 's renaissance in the world 's eyes .
theo zwanziger , president of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , wants to keep the national coach in the job .
" you can trust that i will do everything in my power to make sure that the coaching staff can take this team into the future , " he said .
yet the coach himself has kept a low profile so far .
it still apparently frustrates him that contract talks with the dfb broke down before the tournament .
" after the world cup , i need two or three days to get my thoughts in order .
and then i will certainly have several ideas and visions on how to go on further , " loew said .
he already has the next goal clearly in his sights .
by the 2012 european championship in poland and ukraine , or at the latest at the 2014 world cup in brazil , he wants to win a title .
philipp lahm is also confident about success in the future .
" as you have already seen at past tournaments , we are always in the running for the title , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 12.07.2010 google relaunches street view driving in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : googled : new laws would make the facade unrecognizable google 's street view cars are set to hit the road again in several countries this week , but not in germany where their welcome remains lukewarm . internet giant google grounded its fleet of camera-equipped cars in may , after it transpired that they had inadvertently been gathering personal data from unsecured wi-fi networks .
since then , the cars have been stripped of their wireless scanning technology , which google says means they are now fit to restart street view driving in ireland , norway , south africa and sweden .
for the time being .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the move in germany , a street view car before they were grounded " we expect to add more countries in time , " one of the company 's vice presidents , brian mcclendon , said in a blog , adding that google was aware that serious mistakes had been made in the past .
he said the cars , which have been cruising the world 's streets taking photos for google 's online mapping service for the past few years , would no longer collect any wi-fi information at all .
mcclendon insisted that they will now only collect photographs and 3d imagery , essential for street view , which he considers invaluable for people looking for a hotel or restaurant or to check out a new home .
not on german turf but the snap-happy cars will remain conspicuously absent in germany , which is famed for its particularly strict data protection laws , adopted after world war ii in a bid to keep personal information out of the public sphere .
in response to google 's erroneous street view data collection system , berlin 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , has drawn up draft legislation to further tighten data protection .
as it stands the california-based search engine is already obliged by law to render faces and car license plates appearing in the photographs unrecognizable before publication , and to withdraw pictues of unconsenting people .
too many demands ?
but the new draft , which has yet to be passed by parliament , would go a step further .
the bundesrat wants a provision of anonymity for the facades of buildings if homeowners or tenants so desire .
bildunterschrift : too recognizable for germany ?
companies such as google , seeking to use street level images , would be bound to contact the relevant data protection official three months before any systematic filming was carried out .
failure to comply with the new rules would result in fines of up to 300,000 euros -lrb- $ 377,00 -rrb- .
the proposed legislation is as controversial as the map service itself , with president of germany 's federal association for information technology , telecommunications and new media , august-wilhelm scheer , calling it " political activism " .
he said germany should consider the direction it was taking .
" germany should not become notorious for finding problems with new technology , " he said , adding that data protection should be geared towards international standards .

the team 's refreshing brand of offensive soccer inspired fans of the sport worldwide and made many rethink the way they perceive not only german football , but also germany itself .
germany repeated its placing from 2006 , the tournament it hosted , by prevailing 3-2 over a determined uruguay team in saturday 's match for third place .
" we 're not going back home to germany empty-handed , but with a third place finish , which the team has earned , " said national team head coach joachim loew , the architect of germany 's 2010 showing .
during the 2006 world cup , germany showed itself as a friendly and cosmopolitan country , and the event was widely regarded as an overwhelming success from both the organizational and entertainment points of view .
this year , the national team earned the world 's respect with its exciting , high-scoring style of football .
" abroad , this team is perceived as being very likeable , " said newly elected german president christian wulff , who flew to south africa to watch his country play uruguay .
" some africans have told me this team is something of a ' rainbow ' team , diverse and convincing , " he said .
the stirring performance has even led to a recommendation by wulff that loew receive the federal cross of merit for service to the nation , and that the team be awarded the silver bay laurel leaf , the highest sports award in germany .
" the team is the best ambassador germany has in the world , " wulff added .
german soccer legend franz beckenbauer also praised the national team .
" the mood in south africa was euphoric , and many people have told me that the german team has been the best , " he said .
national team manager and former striker oliver bierhoff gleaned a similarly positive message from the tournament .
" we have managed to create a new picture of germany , not only in a sporting sense , but also socially , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany 's young , multicultural squad celebrated a second consecutive third place finish youthful team shines without ballack the sense of just how much bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm , thomas mueller and co. have changed the way germany is perceived can not be overstated .
no longer will there be comparisons between the national team and tanks , but rather respect and recognition for what was regarded as a thrilling and youthful way of playing football .
" in my opinion this is the best team with the most quality of all the national teams i 've played on up until now , " said lahm , who was given the captain 's armband for the tournament in the absence of the injured michael ballack .
the loss of ballack , germany 's lone yet aging superstar , caused a lot of stress among german fans in the weeks leading up to the world cup .
but the absence of the new bayer leverkusen midfielder turned out to be an opportunity for the national team to reinvent itself .
ballack said he was watching with amazement as his young countrymen put in some memorable performances in south africa , particularly the 4-0 thrashing of diego maradona 's argentina .
" it 's scary that such a young team could take a classy team like argentina , " he said .
goals galore germany also put in great performances against australia , england and uruguay , though group stage games against serbia and ghana left a little to be desired .
the team finished with a goal tally of 16 over seven games , having conceded five .
what 's more , mueller , 20 , picked up the golden boot award with five of those goals and three assists .
mueller also took the award for best young player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semifinal disappointment soon turned to third-place pride for german fans after slotting home eight goals in two games against england and argentina , many pundits were tipping germany to go all the way , but the eventual champions spain proved an insurmountable obstacle .
the swedish newspaper aftonbladet summed up germany 's 1-0 semifinal loss to la furia roja with this comment : " an attractive , young germany required two years -lrb- from the euro 2008 loss to spain -rrb- to rehearse its own variation of spectacular spanish football .
spain needed 90 minutes to show that the germans are not yet the finished product . "
this was a point touched on by schweinsteiger , who himself had an excellent world cup as assistant captain : " we have many young players , who have a big future ahead of them .
they have now gathered a lot of experience from their first tournament .
that is good for future tournaments . "
in addition to being young and relatively unknown outside of germany , the team has also been the subject of much attention due to its multicultural makeup .
eleven of the 23 players on the world cup squad , including mesut oezil , sami khedira and jerome boateng , have roots overseas .
bundesliga in focus with their strong performances in south africa , the german players have boosted their transfer values and fueled the rumor mill .
no day of the world cup went by without players being linked with europe 's top clubs .
mesut oezil in particular is hot property .
five clubs - fc barcelona , manchester city , manchester united , fc valencia and fc arsenal - have apparently expressed interest in securing the playmaker 's transfer from werder bremen .
schweinsteiger hopes , however , that the dazzling performances of the bundesliga players will have the reverse effect .
" we have done the bundesliga proud .
in the future , the biggest players will come to germany , " the midfielder speculated .
loew 's future still uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and his assistant hansi flick 's lucky sweaters took the side far even though a fourth world cup title ultimately eluded germany , loew earned brownie points as the architect of german football 's renaissance in the world 's eyes .
theo zwanziger , president of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , wants to keep the national coach in the job .
" you can trust that i will do everything in my power to make sure that the coaching staff can take this team into the future , " he said .
yet the coach himself has kept a low profile so far .
it still apparently frustrates him that contract talks with the dfb broke down before the tournament .
" after the world cup , i need two or three days to get my thoughts in order .
and then i will certainly have several ideas and visions on how to go on further , " loew said .
he already has the next goal clearly in his sights .
by the 2012 european championship in poland and ukraine , or at the latest at the 2014 world cup in brazil , he wants to win a title .
philipp lahm is also confident about success in the future .
" as you have already seen at past tournaments , we are always in the running for the title , " he said .

without naming specific military officers , retired general giora eiland told reporters in tel aviv on monday that " mistakes were made in the various decisions taken , including within relatively senior ranks , which contributed to the result not being as we would have wished . "
eiland led an internal investigation into the may 31 raid of a turkish-owned flotilla carrying aid supplies to the gaza strip , which israel has largely sealed off because it is controlled by the radical islamist and anti-israel group hamas .
passengers of the boat attacked the israeli soldiers as they landed , and the soldiers opened fire on the crowd , killing eight turkish citizens and one turkish-american dual citizen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raid occurred off the gaza strip in international waters the eiland committee was israel 's response to a global backlash against israel and calls for an international probe .
israel decided to conduct its own investigation instead .
intelligence errors despite its admission of mistakes , the investigation cleared the commandos who conducted the raid of any wrongdoing and said their use of live fire was " justified " because their lives were in danger .
chief of staff gabi ashkenazi said in a statement that the probe found no evidence of " negligence . "
" neither i nor the investigating team detected any omission or negligence , but certainly , in an investigation as thorough as this , errors were found which must be corrected in the future , " he said .
the committee also found evidence of poor information sharing between various state intelligence agencies , and that the navy had underestimated the threat of violence by the activists on board the ship .

all government officials must report their personal details such as income , assets and the whereabouts of their family members , state media said .
the move is a fresh attempt by the chinese government to combat endemic graft . the new rules went into effect on sunday .
they apply to all officials in government posts , political parties and state-owned companies , according to the china daily .
under the rules , the officials are required to report their salary , income from other sources , property owned by them and their family members and investments .
officials are also required to inform the authorities of changes in marital status and the occupations of their spouses and children spouses and children .
officials in china have a long history of hiding their illicit incomes under the names of spouses or other relatives .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all the officials are now required to report their salary and income from other sources punishment for defaulters the state media said those officials who failed to follow the new rules would face punishment ranging from criticism of their conduct to dismissal .
but , as the china daily reported , the new rules fall short of requiring that the income and assets of chinese officials be made public .
the new rules were issued jointly by the state council , china 's cabinet and the ruling communist party .
they are an expansion of regulations adopted in 1995 and 2006 .
the move comes amid increasing complains by ordinary chinese citizens about growing official corruption .
tackling graft is crucial for the communist party , which sees it as a major threat to political stability. du / afp / ap editor : grahame lucas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but who will make deutsche welle 's list of the best 11 in south africa ? the jury for deutsche welle 's top xi consisted of sports editor matt hermann , reporters nick amies and jefferson chase and a special guest .
this year , dw-tv moderator , political expert and renaissance man peter craven joined the fray .
the rules were simple .
four guys , each with one vote per position , come up with the super-duper starting lineup .
four being an even number , we also introduced a tiebreaker .
in case of two of more players being judged relatively equal , the one with the best hair got the nod .
so without any further ado , and staying with the hair theme , here are our picks .
diego and david bildunterschrift : at dw , we 're big fans of forlan peter made an impassioned plea for miroslav klose to be included , in response to jefferson arguing that a fair number of his 14 career world cup goals were tap-ins .
but ultimately , miro had to take a back seat to two of the best players of the tournament .
the first is diego forlan , the uruguay forward who was deservedly named the world cup mvp .
as matt putt it , " he played on a defensively minded team that offered only intermittent support and was the heart and soul throughout . "
normally , we hate football players with loads of talent and swept-back , movie-star blond locks .
but forlan also seemed like a genuinely nice guy when interviewed and played in the true spirit of the beautiful game .
so diego , if you 're ever in berlin , bonn or brussels , we 'd like to buy you a beer .
slightly less likeable but no less prodigious was spain 's david villa .
the diminutive forward kept the spanish in the tournament when they stumbled early on and scored an outrageous goal from just inside the halfway line against chile .
plus he gets extra points for the frank zappa-esque goatee thing .
tommy , schweini , wesley and xavi bildunterschrift : twenty-year-old thomas mueller was the man against argentina the 2010 world cup was a midfielders ' tournament , and ghana 's kevin-prince boateng and japan 's honda drew kudos from the jury .
but ultimately there was consensus on who the middle four should be .
twenty-year-old thomas mueller made everyone 's list .
at an age where most young men 's greatest life achievement involves a fifth of jack daniel 's and a funnel , the german world cup debutant picked up the golden boot and , almost as an afterthought , the best young player award .
his teammate bastian schweinsteiger also swept our ballots for holding midfielder .
we were impressed not only with his presence in midfield but also his leadership qualities , which were one reason germany recovered so well from the loss of captain michael ballack to injury .
the netherlands ' wesley sneijder was a somewhat more curious case .
he never seemed to do anything all that spectacular but ended the world cup with five goals .
as nick put it , " he kind of embodies the dutch approach of players who are really talented and really mouthy - i like that . "
bildunterschrift : xavi is our midfield leader that left one big question : who to take from spain ?
the options , obviously , were xavi or iniesta , but that was like asking a hardcore radiohead fan to say whether " ok computer " or " kid a " is a better album .
iniesta scored two crucial goals , while xavi looked more like the true field general and delivered the pinpoint corner kick that propelled spain past germany .
in the end , xavi won on the hair rule .
iniesta has hardly any , while xavi 's michael corleone slick-back perfectly reflects his ruthless strategic acumen on the pitch .
king poodle and consorts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fine example of the hair rule in action left and right back were relatively easy choices .
spain may not have had the greatest offense , but sergio ramos attracted everyone 's votes for being a constant source of pressure up the left flank .
he was also solid defensively , as spain shut out their final four opponents .
meanwhile , maicon did on the right what ramos did on the left .
no opposing defense really had an answer for the burly brazilian , who is much bigger than most players at his position .
as peter succinctly put it , " the selecao disappointed ; maicon did not . "
selecting central defenders was harder , but we felt we had to pay tribute to new zealand 's ryan nelsen .
" he 's a player with limited gifts , but was at the heart of an amazing campaign , " matt pointed out .
" three games , 270 minutes of white-knuckle defending , one goal conceded .
class . "
we were all over the shop , though , when it came to picking nelsen 's partner .
among the candidates we looked at were friedrich , lugano , pique and lucio .
but in the end , one man stood out from the pack .
he 's been called the caveman and king poodle , but presumably never to his face .
spain 's carlos puyol has been around as long as any of us can remember , and his 2010 performance was as gritty , controlled and clutch as any he has ever turned in .
plus , he 's got the best hair since carlos valderrama .
bildunterschrift : stekelenburg was the netherlands ' flying dutchman who should be between the posts was an even tougher call .
the wacky world cup ball meant that the goalkeepers were pretty tentative , and little separated spain 's iker cassilas , germany 's manuel neuer and holland 's maarten stekelenburg .
but stekelenburg was our ultimate choice .
in nick 's words : " the dutch tended to panic in the last six meters before goal , and they were lucky they had such an agile , intelligent keeper who was on the ball . "
the netherlands would in fact have never made the finals had the lanky dutchman not diverted a short by kaka in their quarterfinal against brazil , when the selecao were leading 1-0 .
so we think he makes a fine addition to a cast of 11 that outshone all others in south africa .
so from all of us to all of you : nice work , guys .
and to carlos puyol in particular : love the hair .

without naming specific military officers , retired general giora eiland told reporters in tel aviv on monday that " mistakes were made in the various decisions taken , including within relatively senior ranks , which contributed to the result not being as we would have wished . "
eiland led an internal investigation into the may 31 raid of a turkish-owned flotilla carrying aid supplies to the gaza strip , which israel has largely sealed off because it is controlled by the radical islamist and anti-israel group hamas .
passengers of the boat attacked the israeli soldiers as they landed , and the soldiers opened fire on the crowd , killing eight turkish citizens and one turkish-american dual citizen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raid occurred off the gaza strip in international waters the eiland committee was israel 's response to a global backlash against israel and calls for an international probe .
israel decided to conduct its own investigation instead .
intelligence errors despite its admission of mistakes , the investigation cleared the commandos who conducted the raid of any wrongdoing and said their use of live fire was " justified " because their lives were in danger .
chief of staff gabi ashkenazi said in a statement that the probe found no evidence of " negligence . "
" neither i nor the investigating team detected any omission or negligence , but certainly , in an investigation as thorough as this , errors were found which must be corrected in the future , " he said .
the committee also found evidence of poor information sharing between various state intelligence agencies , and that the navy had underestimated the threat of violence by the activists on board the ship .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals spain lifts first world cup , beating the netherlands world cup -pipe- 12.07.2010 spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a world cup to remember for uruguay 's forlan the golden ball , the golden boot and whatever the world cup trophy is supposed to represent have all been handed out .
but who will make deutsche welle 's list of the best 11 in south africa ? the jury for deutsche welle 's top xi consisted of sports editor matt hermann , reporters nick amies and jefferson chase and a special guest .
this year , dw-tv moderator , political expert and renaissance man peter craven joined the fray .
the rules were simple .
four guys , each with one vote per position , come up with the super-duper starting lineup .
four being an even number , we also introduced a tiebreaker .
in case of two of more players being judged relatively equal , the one with the best hair got the nod .
so without any further ado , and staying with the hair theme , here are our picks .
diego and david bildunterschrift : at dw , we 're big fans of forlan peter made an impassioned plea for miroslav klose to be included , in response to jefferson arguing that a fair number of his 14 career world cup goals were tap-ins .
but ultimately , miro had to take a back seat to two of the best players of the tournament .
the first is diego forlan , the uruguay forward who was deservedly named the world cup mvp .
as matt putt it , " he played on a defensively minded team that offered only intermittent support and was the heart and soul throughout . "
normally , we hate football players with loads of talent and swept-back , movie-star blond locks .
but forlan also seemed like a genuinely nice guy when interviewed and played in the true spirit of the beautiful game .
so diego , if you 're ever in berlin , bonn or brussels , we 'd like to buy you a beer .
slightly less likeable but no less prodigious was spain 's david villa .
the diminutive forward kept the spanish in the tournament when they stumbled early on and scored an outrageous goal from just inside the halfway line against chile .
plus he gets extra points for the frank zappa-esque goatee thing .
tommy , schweini , wesley and xavi bildunterschrift : twenty-year-old thomas mueller was the man against argentina the 2010 world cup was a midfielders ' tournament , and ghana 's kevin-prince boateng and japan 's honda drew kudos from the jury .
but ultimately there was consensus on who the middle four should be .
twenty-year-old thomas mueller made everyone 's list .
at an age where most young men 's greatest life achievement involves a fifth of jack daniel 's and a funnel , the german world cup debutant picked up the golden boot and , almost as an afterthought , the best young player award .
his teammate bastian schweinsteiger also swept our ballots for holding midfielder .
we were impressed not only with his presence in midfield but also his leadership qualities , which were one reason germany recovered so well from the loss of captain michael ballack to injury .
the netherlands ' wesley sneijder was a somewhat more curious case .
he never seemed to do anything all that spectacular but ended the world cup with five goals .
as nick put it , " he kind of embodies the dutch approach of players who are really talented and really mouthy - i like that . "
bildunterschrift : xavi is our midfield leader that left one big question : who to take from spain ?
the options , obviously , were xavi or iniesta , but that was like asking a hardcore radiohead fan to say whether " ok computer " or " kid a " is a better album .
iniesta scored two crucial goals , while xavi looked more like the true field general and delivered the pinpoint corner kick that propelled spain past germany .
in the end , xavi won on the hair rule .
iniesta has hardly any , while xavi 's michael corleone slick-back perfectly reflects his ruthless strategic acumen on the pitch .
king poodle and consorts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fine example of the hair rule in action left and right back were relatively easy choices .
spain may not have had the greatest offense , but sergio ramos attracted everyone 's votes for being a constant source of pressure up the left flank .
he was also solid defensively , as spain shut out their final four opponents .
meanwhile , maicon did on the right what ramos did on the left .
no opposing defense really had an answer for the burly brazilian , who is much bigger than most players at his position .
as peter succinctly put it , " the selecao disappointed ; maicon did not . "
selecting central defenders was harder , but we felt we had to pay tribute to new zealand 's ryan nelsen .
" he 's a player with limited gifts , but was at the heart of an amazing campaign , " matt pointed out .
" three games , 270 minutes of white-knuckle defending , one goal conceded .
class . "
we were all over the shop , though , when it came to picking nelsen 's partner .
among the candidates we looked at were friedrich , lugano , pique and lucio .
but in the end , one man stood out from the pack .
he 's been called the caveman and king poodle , but presumably never to his face .
spain 's carlos puyol has been around as long as any of us can remember , and his 2010 performance was as gritty , controlled and clutch as any he has ever turned in .
plus , he 's got the best hair since carlos valderrama .
bildunterschrift : stekelenburg was the netherlands ' flying dutchman who should be between the posts was an even tougher call .
the wacky world cup ball meant that the goalkeepers were pretty tentative , and little separated spain 's iker cassilas , germany 's manuel neuer and holland 's maarten stekelenburg .
but stekelenburg was our ultimate choice .
in nick 's words : " the dutch tended to panic in the last six meters before goal , and they were lucky they had such an agile , intelligent keeper who was on the ball . "
the netherlands would in fact have never made the finals had the lanky dutchman not diverted a short by kaka in their quarterfinal against brazil , when the selecao were leading 1-0 .
so we think he makes a fine addition to a cast of 11 that outshone all others in south africa .
so from all of us to all of you : nice work , guys .
and to carlos puyol in particular : love the hair .

the 23 other detainees from the 2003 purge have already been released . a number of released prisoners arrived in spain on tuesday . the united states also agreed to house freed prisoners deported from cuba but issued a statement saying that " those released should be free to decide whether to remain in cuba and those who do leave should be able to return to their country . " the latest prisoner release reduces the number of political prisoners held in cuban jails to 167 , the lowest number since fidel castro took power in 1959 , and some observers believe that the move represents a further shift in policy by the raul castro government . prisoner release eases pressure on castro government julia sweig , the director for latin america studies at the council for foreign relations in washington , believes that the prisoner release could provide cuba with some breathing space to address domestic issues regarding much-needed reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul castro hopes to assuage international pressure " i believe we are seeing a gradual reform of cuba under raul castro , " she told deutsche welle .
" by releasing these prisoners , raul is creating space internationally and domestically to press forward . " professor guenther maihold , an expert on latin american foreign policy and international relations at the german institute for international and security affairs , disagrees .
he says the prisoner release is just a tactic to distract the international community . " this does not represent a real change in cuba 's policies , " maihold told deutsche welle .
" there are still many issues that are troubling to the international community , mainly in the human rights arena , and this prisoner release was engineered to limit the international damage to cuba ’ s foreign policy .
this does n't represent any change within cuba and it is unlikely that we 'll see any domestic changes in terms of rights and democracy . " " what we could see is spain pushing for a change to the eu 's 14-year-old ' common position ' on cuba which demands major political reforms and the release of political prisoners in return for normal relations but whether every eu member state will go with this , it 's hard to say . " international pressure forcing cuba to make gestures the international pressure on castro to release prisoners has increased dramatically since orlando zapata tamayo , one of the dissidents captured in the 2003 purge , died from a hunger strike in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farinas ' hunger strike will resume if promises are broken his death caused outrage and forced raul castro to make a public statement of regret .
tamayo 's death prompted a second prisoner , guillermo farinas , to begin his own hunger strike .
it is thought that farinas ' demands - which included the release of 24 ailing fellow political prisoners - in addition to growing international condemnation , led to the freeing of the 52 . " the death of tamayo was a huge blow to the international reputation of cuba , " said maihold .
" again , castro attempted to limit the damage in the international arena by opening negotiations with the catholic church about the prisoner releases .
he wanted to present the outside world with a humanitarian gesture but in reality , it was designed to ease some of the pressure .

the team 's refreshing brand of offensive soccer inspired fans of the sport worldwide and made many rethink the way they perceive not only german football , but also germany itself .
germany repeated its placing from 2006 , the tournament it hosted , by prevailing 3-2 over a determined uruguay team in saturday 's match for third place .
" we 're not going back home to germany empty-handed , but with a third place finish , which the team has earned , " said national team head coach joachim loew , the architect of germany 's 2010 showing .
during the 2006 world cup , germany showed itself as a friendly and cosmopolitan country , and the event was widely regarded as an overwhelming success from both the organizational and entertainment points of view .
this year , the national team earned the world 's respect with its exciting , high-scoring style of football .
" abroad , this team is perceived as being very likeable , " said newly elected german president christian wulff , who flew to south africa to watch his country play uruguay .
" some africans have told me this team is something of a ' rainbow ' team , diverse and convincing , " he said .
the stirring performance has even led to a recommendation by wulff that loew receive the federal cross of merit for service to the nation , and that the team be awarded the silver bay laurel leaf , the highest sports award in germany .
" the team is the best ambassador germany has in the world , " wulff added .
german soccer legend franz beckenbauer also praised the national team .
" the mood in south africa was euphoric , and many people have told me that the german team has been the best , " he said .
national team manager and former striker oliver bierhoff gleaned a similarly positive message from the tournament .
" we have managed to create a new picture of germany , not only in a sporting sense , but also socially , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany 's young , multicultural squad celebrated a second consecutive third place finish youthful team shines without ballack the sense of just how much bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm , thomas mueller and co. have changed the way germany is perceived can not be overstated .
no longer will there be comparisons between the national team and tanks , but rather respect and recognition for what was regarded as a thrilling and youthful way of playing football .
" in my opinion this is the best team with the most quality of all the national teams i 've played on up until now , " said lahm , who was given the captain 's armband for the tournament in the absence of the injured michael ballack .
the loss of ballack , germany 's lone yet aging superstar , caused a lot of stress among german fans in the weeks leading up to the world cup .
but the absence of the new bayer leverkusen midfielder turned out to be an opportunity for the national team to reinvent itself .
ballack said he was watching with amazement as his young countrymen put in some memorable performances in south africa , particularly the 4-0 thrashing of diego maradona 's argentina .
" it 's scary that such a young team could take a classy team like argentina , " he said .
goals galore germany also put in great performances against australia , england and uruguay , though group stage games against serbia and ghana left a little to be desired .
the team finished with a goal tally of 16 over seven games , having conceded five .
what 's more , mueller , 20 , picked up the golden boot award with five of those goals and three assists .
mueller also took the award for best young player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semifinal disappointment soon turned to third-place pride for german fans after slotting home eight goals in two games against england and argentina , many pundits were tipping germany to go all the way , but the eventual champions spain proved an insurmountable obstacle .
the swedish newspaper aftonbladet summed up germany 's 1-0 semifinal loss to la furia roja with this comment : " an attractive , young germany required two years -lrb- from the euro 2008 loss to spain -rrb- to rehearse its own variation of spectacular spanish football .
spain needed 90 minutes to show that the germans are not yet the finished product . "
this was a point touched on by schweinsteiger , who himself had an excellent world cup as assistant captain : " we have many young players , who have a big future ahead of them .
they have now gathered a lot of experience from their first tournament .
that is good for future tournaments . "
in addition to being young and relatively unknown outside of germany , the team has also been the subject of much attention due to its multicultural makeup .
eleven of the 23 players on the world cup squad , including mesut oezil , sami khedira and jerome boateng , have roots overseas .
bundesliga in focus with their strong performances in south africa , the german players have boosted their transfer values and fueled the rumor mill .
no day of the world cup went by without players being linked with europe 's top clubs .
mesut oezil in particular is hot property .
five clubs - fc barcelona , manchester city , manchester united , fc valencia and fc arsenal - have apparently expressed interest in securing the playmaker 's transfer from werder bremen .
schweinsteiger hopes , however , that the dazzling performances of the bundesliga players will have the reverse effect .
" we have done the bundesliga proud .
in the future , the biggest players will come to germany , " the midfielder speculated .
loew 's future still uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and his assistant hansi flick 's lucky sweaters took the side far even though a fourth world cup title ultimately eluded germany , loew earned brownie points as the architect of german football 's renaissance in the world 's eyes .
theo zwanziger , president of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , wants to keep the national coach in the job .
" you can trust that i will do everything in my power to make sure that the coaching staff can take this team into the future , " he said .
yet the coach himself has kept a low profile so far .
it still apparently frustrates him that contract talks with the dfb broke down before the tournament .
" after the world cup , i need two or three days to get my thoughts in order .
and then i will certainly have several ideas and visions on how to go on further , " loew said .
he already has the next goal clearly in his sights .
by the 2012 european championship in poland and ukraine , or at the latest at the 2014 world cup in brazil , he wants to win a title .
philipp lahm is also confident about success in the future .
" as you have already seen at past tournaments , we are always in the running for the title , " he said .

meanwhile , president sarkozy is to appear on tv to try to quell a political funding scandal . french financial investigators have cleared the country 's labor minister , eric woerth , of accusations that he helped the l 'oreal billionaire liliane bettencourt to evade taxes .
the findings came as welcome news for french president nicolas sarkozy , whose government has been rocked in recent weeks by a scandal over political donations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aims to prevent further embarassment for his government france 's general financial inspection office -lrb- igf -rrb- said woerth did not use his powers while serving as budget minister to prevent the tax affairs of bettencourt from being investigated .
" during the period when he was budget minister , woerth did not intervene in the services under his authority to demand , prevent or influence a decision or an inspection affecting mrs. bettencourt , " read a statement issued by the french finance ministry , which presides over the igf , on sunday .
however questions remain about woerth 's role as treasurer of sarkozy 's ump , in alleged illegal donations to the party and his links to bettencourt .
conflict of interest ?
the politician , whose wife worked for a company managing bettencourt 's estate , has been accused of having a conflict of interest .
a former accountant for bettencourt alleged last week that woerth had been given 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 190,000 -rrb- from the 87-year-old heiress as a donation for sarkozy 's presidential campaign in 2007 , a sum far above than the legal limit .
separate investigations have been opened into those allegations , as well as bettencourt 's financial affairs .
sarkozy is to appear on television on monday evening to talk about the scandal for the first time .
the appearance comes as woerth prepares to launch a controversial pensions bill on tuesday , a central plank of sarkozy 's reform agenda ahead of elections in 2012 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 12.07.2010 us welcomes cuba 's release of dissidents but remains suspicious großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the release is unlikely to solve the rift in cuba-us relations the release of 52 political prisoners by cuba has been welcomed by the us but while experts admit that this represents a significant shift , cuba needs to take further steps before relations can be normalized . the decision by cuba to release 52 political prisoners has been welcomed by officials in the united states and the european union but while politicians on both sides of the atlantic admit that the move represents a significant shift , the communist caribbean nation needs to take further steps before negotiations on normalizing relations can begin . the deal to release the prisoners , who were among 75 dissidents rounded up during a major crackdown in march 2003 on anti-state and counter-revolutionary charges , was brokered by spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos and cardinal jaime ortega , head of the roman catholic church in cuba .
the 23 other detainees from the 2003 purge have already been released . a number of released prisoners arrived in spain on tuesday . the united states also agreed to house freed prisoners deported from cuba but issued a statement saying that " those released should be free to decide whether to remain in cuba and those who do leave should be able to return to their country . " the latest prisoner release reduces the number of political prisoners held in cuban jails to 167 , the lowest number since fidel castro took power in 1959 , and some observers believe that the move represents a further shift in policy by the raul castro government . prisoner release eases pressure on castro government julia sweig , the director for latin america studies at the council for foreign relations in washington , believes that the prisoner release could provide cuba with some breathing space to address domestic issues regarding much-needed reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul castro hopes to assuage international pressure " i believe we are seeing a gradual reform of cuba under raul castro , " she told deutsche welle .
" by releasing these prisoners , raul is creating space internationally and domestically to press forward . " professor guenther maihold , an expert on latin american foreign policy and international relations at the german institute for international and security affairs , disagrees .
he says the prisoner release is just a tactic to distract the international community . " this does not represent a real change in cuba 's policies , " maihold told deutsche welle .
" there are still many issues that are troubling to the international community , mainly in the human rights arena , and this prisoner release was engineered to limit the international damage to cuba ’ s foreign policy .
this does n't represent any change within cuba and it is unlikely that we 'll see any domestic changes in terms of rights and democracy . " " what we could see is spain pushing for a change to the eu 's 14-year-old ' common position ' on cuba which demands major political reforms and the release of political prisoners in return for normal relations but whether every eu member state will go with this , it 's hard to say . " international pressure forcing cuba to make gestures the international pressure on castro to release prisoners has increased dramatically since orlando zapata tamayo , one of the dissidents captured in the 2003 purge , died from a hunger strike in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farinas ' hunger strike will resume if promises are broken his death caused outrage and forced raul castro to make a public statement of regret .
tamayo 's death prompted a second prisoner , guillermo farinas , to begin his own hunger strike .
it is thought that farinas ' demands - which included the release of 24 ailing fellow political prisoners - in addition to growing international condemnation , led to the freeing of the 52 . " the death of tamayo was a huge blow to the international reputation of cuba , " said maihold .
" again , castro attempted to limit the damage in the international arena by opening negotiations with the catholic church about the prisoner releases .
he wanted to present the outside world with a humanitarian gesture but in reality , it was designed to ease some of the pressure . " while the decision to release the 52 prisoners was welcomed in washington , prompting the most positive comments by a top administration official to date , the us state department was quick to clarify that havana still needed to do more in areas such as human rights before an end to the 50-year-old trade embargo and a normalization of relations could be considered . washington welcomes move but embargo remains for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinto welcomed the move but refused to talk of the embargo us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters that the latest move by havana was overdue but " a positive sign " and " nevertheless very welcome . " reopening dialogue with cuba has been part of the obama administration 's policy of engagement with its adversaries and last year , the white house lifted travel and money transfer restrictions on cuban-americans with relatives in the caribbean nation . the us president has also said that freeing political prisoners was a precondition for a more rapid improvement in bilateral ties , prompting some observers to suggest that the latest prisoner release could lead to congress approving pending legislation that would end the ban on us citizens travelling to cuba . us remains suspicious of castro and his agenda however , despite a shift in position from that of the previous administration , experts believe that obama has so far only taken modest steps to reverse george w. bush 's policy of increased isolation and tightening of sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to keep castro 's cuba at arm 's length " obama has been quite cautious when dealing with cuba and he has taken a very informal approach , " said maihold .
" he has eased some restrictions on travel and visas but he has n't really committed to anything too serious . " " this prisoner release wo n't be seen by the us as a turning point in relations .
it can be seen as a positive result for obama 's approach but washington has seen steps like this in the past where prisoners were released and in a few months cuba was rounding up people from a different group . this will in no way influence the us to lift the embargo . "
" obama 's approach has not gone very far to normalize relations with cuba as yet , " said sweig .
" however , this prisoner release could neutralize some of the domestic political opposition to his stance on cuba and give him and congress the room to start getting rid of sanctions and accelerate his push for bilateral diplomacy with cuba . " " change regarding the embargo in the us is taking place at about the same speed as the reforms in cuba - which is very slowly .
this is about as much as the domestic political structures in both countries can handle right now , " she added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 23 other detainees from the 2003 purge have already been released . a number of released prisoners arrived in spain on tuesday . the united states also agreed to house freed prisoners deported from cuba but issued a statement saying that " those released should be free to decide whether to remain in cuba and those who do leave should be able to return to their country . " the latest prisoner release reduces the number of political prisoners held in cuban jails to 167 , the lowest number since fidel castro took power in 1959 , and some observers believe that the move represents a further shift in policy by the raul castro government . prisoner release eases pressure on castro government julia sweig , the director for latin america studies at the council for foreign relations in washington , believes that the prisoner release could provide cuba with some breathing space to address domestic issues regarding much-needed reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul castro hopes to assuage international pressure " i believe we are seeing a gradual reform of cuba under raul castro , " she told deutsche welle .
" by releasing these prisoners , raul is creating space internationally and domestically to press forward . " professor guenther maihold , an expert on latin american foreign policy and international relations at the german institute for international and security affairs , disagrees .
he says the prisoner release is just a tactic to distract the international community . " this does not represent a real change in cuba 's policies , " maihold told deutsche welle .
" there are still many issues that are troubling to the international community , mainly in the human rights arena , and this prisoner release was engineered to limit the international damage to cuba ’ s foreign policy .
this does n't represent any change within cuba and it is unlikely that we 'll see any domestic changes in terms of rights and democracy . " " what we could see is spain pushing for a change to the eu 's 14-year-old ' common position ' on cuba which demands major political reforms and the release of political prisoners in return for normal relations but whether every eu member state will go with this , it 's hard to say . " international pressure forcing cuba to make gestures the international pressure on castro to release prisoners has increased dramatically since orlando zapata tamayo , one of the dissidents captured in the 2003 purge , died from a hunger strike in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farinas ' hunger strike will resume if promises are broken his death caused outrage and forced raul castro to make a public statement of regret .
tamayo 's death prompted a second prisoner , guillermo farinas , to begin his own hunger strike .
it is thought that farinas ' demands - which included the release of 24 ailing fellow political prisoners - in addition to growing international condemnation , led to the freeing of the 52 . " the death of tamayo was a huge blow to the international reputation of cuba , " said maihold .
" again , castro attempted to limit the damage in the international arena by opening negotiations with the catholic church about the prisoner releases .
he wanted to present the outside world with a humanitarian gesture but in reality , it was designed to ease some of the pressure . " while the decision to release the 52 prisoners was welcomed in washington , prompting the most positive comments by a top administration official to date , the us state department was quick to clarify that havana still needed to do more in areas such as human rights before an end to the 50-year-old trade embargo and a normalization of relations could be considered . washington welcomes move but embargo remains for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinto welcomed the move but refused to talk of the embargo us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters that the latest move by havana was overdue but " a positive sign " and " nevertheless very welcome . " reopening dialogue with cuba has been part of the obama administration 's policy of engagement with its adversaries and last year , the white house lifted travel and money transfer restrictions on cuban-americans with relatives in the caribbean nation . the us president has also said that freeing political prisoners was a precondition for a more rapid improvement in bilateral ties , prompting some observers to suggest that the latest prisoner release could lead to congress approving pending legislation that would end the ban on us citizens travelling to cuba . us remains suspicious of castro and his agenda however , despite a shift in position from that of the previous administration , experts believe that obama has so far only taken modest steps to reverse george w. bush 's policy of increased isolation and tightening of sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to keep castro 's cuba at arm 's length " obama has been quite cautious when dealing with cuba and he has taken a very informal approach , " said maihold .
" he has eased some restrictions on travel and visas but he has n't really committed to anything too serious . " " this prisoner release wo n't be seen by the us as a turning point in relations .
it can be seen as a positive result for obama 's approach but washington has seen steps like this in the past where prisoners were released and in a few months cuba was rounding up people from a different group . this will in no way influence the us to lift the embargo . "
" obama 's approach has not gone very far to normalize relations with cuba as yet , " said sweig .
" however , this prisoner release could neutralize some of the domestic political opposition to his stance on cuba and give him and congress the room to start getting rid of sanctions and accelerate his push for bilateral diplomacy with cuba . " " change regarding the embargo in the us is taking place at about the same speed as the reforms in cuba - which is very slowly .
this is about as much as the domestic political structures in both countries can handle right now , " she added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 12.07.2010 us welcomes cuba 's release of dissidents but remains suspicious großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the release is unlikely to solve the rift in cuba-us relations the release of 52 political prisoners by cuba has been welcomed by the us but while experts admit that this represents a significant shift , cuba needs to take further steps before relations can be normalized . the decision by cuba to release 52 political prisoners has been welcomed by officials in the united states and the european union but while politicians on both sides of the atlantic admit that the move represents a significant shift , the communist caribbean nation needs to take further steps before negotiations on normalizing relations can begin . the deal to release the prisoners , who were among 75 dissidents rounded up during a major crackdown in march 2003 on anti-state and counter-revolutionary charges , was brokered by spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos and cardinal jaime ortega , head of the roman catholic church in cuba .
the 23 other detainees from the 2003 purge have already been released . a number of released prisoners arrived in spain on tuesday . the united states also agreed to house freed prisoners deported from cuba but issued a statement saying that " those released should be free to decide whether to remain in cuba and those who do leave should be able to return to their country . " the latest prisoner release reduces the number of political prisoners held in cuban jails to 167 , the lowest number since fidel castro took power in 1959 , and some observers believe that the move represents a further shift in policy by the raul castro government . prisoner release eases pressure on castro government julia sweig , the director for latin america studies at the council for foreign relations in washington , believes that the prisoner release could provide cuba with some breathing space to address domestic issues regarding much-needed reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul castro hopes to assuage international pressure " i believe we are seeing a gradual reform of cuba under raul castro , " she told deutsche welle .
" by releasing these prisoners , raul is creating space internationally and domestically to press forward . " professor guenther maihold , an expert on latin american foreign policy and international relations at the german institute for international and security affairs , disagrees .
he says the prisoner release is just a tactic to distract the international community . " this does not represent a real change in cuba 's policies , " maihold told deutsche welle .
" there are still many issues that are troubling to the international community , mainly in the human rights arena , and this prisoner release was engineered to limit the international damage to cuba ’ s foreign policy .
this does n't represent any change within cuba and it is unlikely that we 'll see any domestic changes in terms of rights and democracy . " " what we could see is spain pushing for a change to the eu 's 14-year-old ' common position ' on cuba which demands major political reforms and the release of political prisoners in return for normal relations but whether every eu member state will go with this , it 's hard to say . " international pressure forcing cuba to make gestures the international pressure on castro to release prisoners has increased dramatically since orlando zapata tamayo , one of the dissidents captured in the 2003 purge , died from a hunger strike in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farinas ' hunger strike will resume if promises are broken his death caused outrage and forced raul castro to make a public statement of regret .
tamayo 's death prompted a second prisoner , guillermo farinas , to begin his own hunger strike .
it is thought that farinas ' demands - which included the release of 24 ailing fellow political prisoners - in addition to growing international condemnation , led to the freeing of the 52 . " the death of tamayo was a huge blow to the international reputation of cuba , " said maihold .
" again , castro attempted to limit the damage in the international arena by opening negotiations with the catholic church about the prisoner releases .
he wanted to present the outside world with a humanitarian gesture but in reality , it was designed to ease some of the pressure . " while the decision to release the 52 prisoners was welcomed in washington , prompting the most positive comments by a top administration official to date , the us state department was quick to clarify that havana still needed to do more in areas such as human rights before an end to the 50-year-old trade embargo and a normalization of relations could be considered . washington welcomes move but embargo remains for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinto welcomed the move but refused to talk of the embargo us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters that the latest move by havana was overdue but " a positive sign " and " nevertheless very welcome . " reopening dialogue with cuba has been part of the obama administration 's policy of engagement with its adversaries and last year , the white house lifted travel and money transfer restrictions on cuban-americans with relatives in the caribbean nation . the us president has also said that freeing political prisoners was a precondition for a more rapid improvement in bilateral ties , prompting some observers to suggest that the latest prisoner release could lead to congress approving pending legislation that would end the ban on us citizens travelling to cuba . us remains suspicious of castro and his agenda however , despite a shift in position from that of the previous administration , experts believe that obama has so far only taken modest steps to reverse george w. bush 's policy of increased isolation and tightening of sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to keep castro 's cuba at arm 's length " obama has been quite cautious when dealing with cuba and he has taken a very informal approach , " said maihold .
" he has eased some restrictions on travel and visas but he has n't really committed to anything too serious . " " this prisoner release wo n't be seen by the us as a turning point in relations .
it can be seen as a positive result for obama 's approach but washington has seen steps like this in the past where prisoners were released and in a few months cuba was rounding up people from a different group . this will in no way influence the us to lift the embargo . "
" obama 's approach has not gone very far to normalize relations with cuba as yet , " said sweig .
" however , this prisoner release could neutralize some of the domestic political opposition to his stance on cuba and give him and congress the room to start getting rid of sanctions and accelerate his push for bilateral diplomacy with cuba . " " change regarding the embargo in the us is taking place at about the same speed as the reforms in cuba - which is very slowly .
this is about as much as the domestic political structures in both countries can handle right now , " she added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , president sarkozy is to appear on tv to try to quell a political funding scandal . french financial investigators have cleared the country 's labor minister , eric woerth , of accusations that he helped the l 'oreal billionaire liliane bettencourt to evade taxes .
the findings came as welcome news for french president nicolas sarkozy , whose government has been rocked in recent weeks by a scandal over political donations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy aims to prevent further embarassment for his government france 's general financial inspection office -lrb- igf -rrb- said woerth did not use his powers while serving as budget minister to prevent the tax affairs of bettencourt from being investigated .
" during the period when he was budget minister , woerth did not intervene in the services under his authority to demand , prevent or influence a decision or an inspection affecting mrs. bettencourt , " read a statement issued by the french finance ministry , which presides over the igf , on sunday .
however questions remain about woerth 's role as treasurer of sarkozy 's ump , in alleged illegal donations to the party and his links to bettencourt .
conflict of interest ?
the politician , whose wife worked for a company managing bettencourt 's estate , has been accused of having a conflict of interest .
a former accountant for bettencourt alleged last week that woerth had been given 150,000 euros -lrb- $ 190,000 -rrb- from the 87-year-old heiress as a donation for sarkozy 's presidential campaign in 2007 , a sum far above than the legal limit .
separate investigations have been opened into those allegations , as well as bettencourt 's financial affairs .
sarkozy is to appear on television on monday evening to talk about the scandal for the first time .
the appearance comes as woerth prepares to launch a controversial pensions bill on tuesday , a central plank of sarkozy 's reform agenda ahead of elections in 2012 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 12.07.2010 us welcomes cuba 's release of dissidents but remains suspicious großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the release is unlikely to solve the rift in cuba-us relations the release of 52 political prisoners by cuba has been welcomed by the us but while experts admit that this represents a significant shift , cuba needs to take further steps before relations can be normalized . the decision by cuba to release 52 political prisoners has been welcomed by officials in the united states and the european union but while politicians on both sides of the atlantic admit that the move represents a significant shift , the communist caribbean nation needs to take further steps before negotiations on normalizing relations can begin . the deal to release the prisoners , who were among 75 dissidents rounded up during a major crackdown in march 2003 on anti-state and counter-revolutionary charges , was brokered by spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos and cardinal jaime ortega , head of the roman catholic church in cuba .
the 23 other detainees from the 2003 purge have already been released . a number of released prisoners arrived in spain on tuesday . the united states also agreed to house freed prisoners deported from cuba but issued a statement saying that " those released should be free to decide whether to remain in cuba and those who do leave should be able to return to their country . " the latest prisoner release reduces the number of political prisoners held in cuban jails to 167 , the lowest number since fidel castro took power in 1959 , and some observers believe that the move represents a further shift in policy by the raul castro government . prisoner release eases pressure on castro government julia sweig , the director for latin america studies at the council for foreign relations in washington , believes that the prisoner release could provide cuba with some breathing space to address domestic issues regarding much-needed reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul castro hopes to assuage international pressure " i believe we are seeing a gradual reform of cuba under raul castro , " she told deutsche welle .
" by releasing these prisoners , raul is creating space internationally and domestically to press forward . " professor guenther maihold , an expert on latin american foreign policy and international relations at the german institute for international and security affairs , disagrees .
he says the prisoner release is just a tactic to distract the international community . " this does not represent a real change in cuba 's policies , " maihold told deutsche welle .
" there are still many issues that are troubling to the international community , mainly in the human rights arena , and this prisoner release was engineered to limit the international damage to cuba ’ s foreign policy .
this does n't represent any change within cuba and it is unlikely that we 'll see any domestic changes in terms of rights and democracy . " " what we could see is spain pushing for a change to the eu 's 14-year-old ' common position ' on cuba which demands major political reforms and the release of political prisoners in return for normal relations but whether every eu member state will go with this , it 's hard to say . " international pressure forcing cuba to make gestures the international pressure on castro to release prisoners has increased dramatically since orlando zapata tamayo , one of the dissidents captured in the 2003 purge , died from a hunger strike in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farinas ' hunger strike will resume if promises are broken his death caused outrage and forced raul castro to make a public statement of regret .
tamayo 's death prompted a second prisoner , guillermo farinas , to begin his own hunger strike .
it is thought that farinas ' demands - which included the release of 24 ailing fellow political prisoners - in addition to growing international condemnation , led to the freeing of the 52 . " the death of tamayo was a huge blow to the international reputation of cuba , " said maihold .
" again , castro attempted to limit the damage in the international arena by opening negotiations with the catholic church about the prisoner releases .
he wanted to present the outside world with a humanitarian gesture but in reality , it was designed to ease some of the pressure . " while the decision to release the 52 prisoners was welcomed in washington , prompting the most positive comments by a top administration official to date , the us state department was quick to clarify that havana still needed to do more in areas such as human rights before an end to the 50-year-old trade embargo and a normalization of relations could be considered . washington welcomes move but embargo remains for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinto welcomed the move but refused to talk of the embargo us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters that the latest move by havana was overdue but " a positive sign " and " nevertheless very welcome . " reopening dialogue with cuba has been part of the obama administration 's policy of engagement with its adversaries and last year , the white house lifted travel and money transfer restrictions on cuban-americans with relatives in the caribbean nation . the us president has also said that freeing political prisoners was a precondition for a more rapid improvement in bilateral ties , prompting some observers to suggest that the latest prisoner release could lead to congress approving pending legislation that would end the ban on us citizens travelling to cuba . us remains suspicious of castro and his agenda however , despite a shift in position from that of the previous administration , experts believe that obama has so far only taken modest steps to reverse george w. bush 's policy of increased isolation and tightening of sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to keep castro 's cuba at arm 's length " obama has been quite cautious when dealing with cuba and he has taken a very informal approach , " said maihold .
" he has eased some restrictions on travel and visas but he has n't really committed to anything too serious . " " this prisoner release wo n't be seen by the us as a turning point in relations .
it can be seen as a positive result for obama 's approach but washington has seen steps like this in the past where prisoners were released and in a few months cuba was rounding up people from a different group . this will in no way influence the us to lift the embargo . "
" obama 's approach has not gone very far to normalize relations with cuba as yet , " said sweig .
" however , this prisoner release could neutralize some of the domestic political opposition to his stance on cuba and give him and congress the room to start getting rid of sanctions and accelerate his push for bilateral diplomacy with cuba . " " change regarding the embargo in the us is taking place at about the same speed as the reforms in cuba - which is very slowly .
this is about as much as the domestic political structures in both countries can handle right now , " she added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in a televised interview on monday , he staunchly defended himself and his allies . appearing in an interview on national television monday night , french president nicolas sarkozy defended his scandal-stricken minister of labor and social affairs eric woerth and called for a conflict of interest inquiry to put to rest the criticism that has ensued .
" eric woerth is an honest man , a competent man , " sarkozy told france 2 television .
" he enjoys my full confidence . "
sarkozy has been hit by a campaign finance scandal surrounding woerth , in which a former accountant of billionaire l 'oreal heiress liliane bettencourt accused him of accepting an illegal 150,000 euro -lrb- $ 190,000 -rrb- donation for sarkozy 's election campaign in 2007 .
the accountant also accused bettencourt and her late husband of making several other illegal donations to conservative politicians .
in the interview , sarkozy claimed that the scandal was timed to weaken his government as it prepares to embark on an ambitious and controversial reform of the nation 's pension scheme , which woerth is charged with leading .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woerth is in charge of the government 's unpopular pension reform sarkozy said he had asked woerth to step down as treasurer of his ruling ump party , but that woerth would continue his leadership in the pension reform , which involves raising the retirement age from 60 to 62 .
broad span of scandal woerth 's wife has also been caught up in the scandal .
she had worked as a wealth manager for bettencourt , raising questions of a conflict of interest , but quit after secretly taped conversations last month apparently revealed bettencourt 's plans to evade taxes .
federal investigators on sunday cleared woerth of any involvement in the tax evasion scandal , but made no mention of the alleged illegal campaign donation .
just hours before sarkozy 's address , police searched the home of 87-year-old bettencourt , france 's richest woman , in search of evidence in the scandal .
they also searched the home of photographer francois-marie banier , whom bettencourt 's daughter has accused of taking advantage of the heiress ' frailty by taking gifts worth 1 billion euros .

but in a televised interview on monday , he staunchly defended himself and his allies . appearing in an interview on national television monday night , french president nicolas sarkozy defended his scandal-stricken minister of labor and social affairs eric woerth and called for a conflict of interest inquiry to put to rest the criticism that has ensued .
" eric woerth is an honest man , a competent man , " sarkozy told france 2 television .
" he enjoys my full confidence . "
sarkozy has been hit by a campaign finance scandal surrounding woerth , in which a former accountant of billionaire l 'oreal heiress liliane bettencourt accused him of accepting an illegal 150,000 euro -lrb- $ 190,000 -rrb- donation for sarkozy 's election campaign in 2007 .
the accountant also accused bettencourt and her late husband of making several other illegal donations to conservative politicians .
in the interview , sarkozy claimed that the scandal was timed to weaken his government as it prepares to embark on an ambitious and controversial reform of the nation 's pension scheme , which woerth is charged with leading .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals spain lifts first world cup , beating the netherlands world cup -pipe- 12.07.2010 spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a world cup to remember for uruguay 's forlan the golden ball , the golden boot and whatever the world cup trophy is supposed to represent have all been handed out .
but who will make deutsche welle 's list of the best 11 in south africa ? the jury for deutsche welle 's top xi consisted of sports editor matt hermann , reporters nick amies and jefferson chase and a special guest .
this year , dw-tv moderator , political expert and renaissance man peter craven joined the fray .
the rules were simple .
four guys , each with one vote per position , come up with the super-duper starting lineup .
four being an even number , we also introduced a tiebreaker .
in case of two of more players being judged relatively equal , the one with the best hair got the nod .
so without any further ado , and staying with the hair theme , here are our picks .
diego and david bildunterschrift : at dw , we 're big fans of forlan peter made an impassioned plea for miroslav klose to be included , in response to jefferson arguing that a fair number of his 14 career world cup goals were tap-ins .
but ultimately , miro had to take a back seat to two of the best players of the tournament .
the first is diego forlan , the uruguay forward who was deservedly named the world cup mvp .
as matt putt it , " he played on a defensively minded team that offered only intermittent support and was the heart and soul throughout . "
normally , we hate football players with loads of talent and swept-back , movie-star blond locks .
but forlan also seemed like a genuinely nice guy when interviewed and played in the true spirit of the beautiful game .
so diego , if you 're ever in berlin , bonn or brussels , we 'd like to buy you a beer .
slightly less likeable but no less prodigious was spain 's david villa .
the diminutive forward kept the spanish in the tournament when they stumbled early on and scored an outrageous goal from just inside the halfway line against chile .
plus he gets extra points for the frank zappa-esque goatee thing .
tommy , schweini , wesley and xavi bildunterschrift : twenty-year-old thomas mueller was the man against argentina the 2010 world cup was a midfielders ' tournament , and ghana 's kevin-prince boateng and japan 's honda drew kudos from the jury .
but ultimately there was consensus on who the middle four should be .
twenty-year-old thomas mueller made everyone 's list .
at an age where most young men 's greatest life achievement involves a fifth of jack daniel 's and a funnel , the german world cup debutant picked up the golden boot and , almost as an afterthought , the best young player award .
his teammate bastian schweinsteiger also swept our ballots for holding midfielder .
we were impressed not only with his presence in midfield but also his leadership qualities , which were one reason germany recovered so well from the loss of captain michael ballack to injury .
the netherlands ' wesley sneijder was a somewhat more curious case .
he never seemed to do anything all that spectacular but ended the world cup with five goals .
as nick put it , " he kind of embodies the dutch approach of players who are really talented and really mouthy - i like that . "
bildunterschrift : xavi is our midfield leader that left one big question : who to take from spain ?
the options , obviously , were xavi or iniesta , but that was like asking a hardcore radiohead fan to say whether " ok computer " or " kid a " is a better album .
iniesta scored two crucial goals , while xavi looked more like the true field general and delivered the pinpoint corner kick that propelled spain past germany .
in the end , xavi won on the hair rule .
iniesta has hardly any , while xavi 's michael corleone slick-back perfectly reflects his ruthless strategic acumen on the pitch .
king poodle and consorts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fine example of the hair rule in action left and right back were relatively easy choices .
spain may not have had the greatest offense , but sergio ramos attracted everyone 's votes for being a constant source of pressure up the left flank .
he was also solid defensively , as spain shut out their final four opponents .
meanwhile , maicon did on the right what ramos did on the left .
no opposing defense really had an answer for the burly brazilian , who is much bigger than most players at his position .
as peter succinctly put it , " the selecao disappointed ; maicon did not . "
selecting central defenders was harder , but we felt we had to pay tribute to new zealand 's ryan nelsen .
" he 's a player with limited gifts , but was at the heart of an amazing campaign , " matt pointed out .
" three games , 270 minutes of white-knuckle defending , one goal conceded .
class . "
we were all over the shop , though , when it came to picking nelsen 's partner .
among the candidates we looked at were friedrich , lugano , pique and lucio .
but in the end , one man stood out from the pack .
he 's been called the caveman and king poodle , but presumably never to his face .
spain 's carlos puyol has been around as long as any of us can remember , and his 2010 performance was as gritty , controlled and clutch as any he has ever turned in .
plus , he 's got the best hair since carlos valderrama .
bildunterschrift : stekelenburg was the netherlands ' flying dutchman who should be between the posts was an even tougher call .
the wacky world cup ball meant that the goalkeepers were pretty tentative , and little separated spain 's iker cassilas , germany 's manuel neuer and holland 's maarten stekelenburg .
but stekelenburg was our ultimate choice .
in nick 's words : " the dutch tended to panic in the last six meters before goal , and they were lucky they had such an agile , intelligent keeper who was on the ball . "
the netherlands would in fact have never made the finals had the lanky dutchman not diverted a short by kaka in their quarterfinal against brazil , when the selecao were leading 1-0 .
so we think he makes a fine addition to a cast of 11 that outshone all others in south africa .
so from all of us to all of you : nice work , guys .
and to carlos puyol in particular : love the hair .

but in a televised interview on monday , he staunchly defended himself and his allies . appearing in an interview on national television monday night , french president nicolas sarkozy defended his scandal-stricken minister of labor and social affairs eric woerth and called for a conflict of interest inquiry to put to rest the criticism that has ensued .
" eric woerth is an honest man , a competent man , " sarkozy told france 2 television .
" he enjoys my full confidence . "
sarkozy has been hit by a campaign finance scandal surrounding woerth , in which a former accountant of billionaire l 'oreal heiress liliane bettencourt accused him of accepting an illegal 150,000 euro -lrb- $ 190,000 -rrb- donation for sarkozy 's election campaign in 2007 .
the accountant also accused bettencourt and her late husband of making several other illegal donations to conservative politicians .
in the interview , sarkozy claimed that the scandal was timed to weaken his government as it prepares to embark on an ambitious and controversial reform of the nation 's pension scheme , which woerth is charged with leading .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woerth is in charge of the government 's unpopular pension reform sarkozy said he had asked woerth to step down as treasurer of his ruling ump party , but that woerth would continue his leadership in the pension reform , which involves raising the retirement age from 60 to 62 .
broad span of scandal woerth 's wife has also been caught up in the scandal .
she had worked as a wealth manager for bettencourt , raising questions of a conflict of interest , but quit after secretly taped conversations last month apparently revealed bettencourt 's plans to evade taxes .
federal investigators on sunday cleared woerth of any involvement in the tax evasion scandal , but made no mention of the alleged illegal campaign donation .
just hours before sarkozy 's address , police searched the home of 87-year-old bettencourt , france 's richest woman , in search of evidence in the scandal .
they also searched the home of photographer francois-marie banier , whom bettencourt 's daughter has accused of taking advantage of the heiress ' frailty by taking gifts worth 1 billion euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 12.07.2010 us welcomes cuba 's release of dissidents but remains suspicious großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the release is unlikely to solve the rift in cuba-us relations the release of 52 political prisoners by cuba has been welcomed by the us but while experts admit that this represents a significant shift , cuba needs to take further steps before relations can be normalized . the decision by cuba to release 52 political prisoners has been welcomed by officials in the united states and the european union but while politicians on both sides of the atlantic admit that the move represents a significant shift , the communist caribbean nation needs to take further steps before negotiations on normalizing relations can begin . the deal to release the prisoners , who were among 75 dissidents rounded up during a major crackdown in march 2003 on anti-state and counter-revolutionary charges , was brokered by spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos and cardinal jaime ortega , head of the roman catholic church in cuba .
the 23 other detainees from the 2003 purge have already been released . a number of released prisoners arrived in spain on tuesday . the united states also agreed to house freed prisoners deported from cuba but issued a statement saying that " those released should be free to decide whether to remain in cuba and those who do leave should be able to return to their country . " the latest prisoner release reduces the number of political prisoners held in cuban jails to 167 , the lowest number since fidel castro took power in 1959 , and some observers believe that the move represents a further shift in policy by the raul castro government . prisoner release eases pressure on castro government julia sweig , the director for latin america studies at the council for foreign relations in washington , believes that the prisoner release could provide cuba with some breathing space to address domestic issues regarding much-needed reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul castro hopes to assuage international pressure " i believe we are seeing a gradual reform of cuba under raul castro , " she told deutsche welle .
" by releasing these prisoners , raul is creating space internationally and domestically to press forward . " professor guenther maihold , an expert on latin american foreign policy and international relations at the german institute for international and security affairs , disagrees .
he says the prisoner release is just a tactic to distract the international community . " this does not represent a real change in cuba 's policies , " maihold told deutsche welle .
" there are still many issues that are troubling to the international community , mainly in the human rights arena , and this prisoner release was engineered to limit the international damage to cuba ’ s foreign policy .
this does n't represent any change within cuba and it is unlikely that we 'll see any domestic changes in terms of rights and democracy . " " what we could see is spain pushing for a change to the eu 's 14-year-old ' common position ' on cuba which demands major political reforms and the release of political prisoners in return for normal relations but whether every eu member state will go with this , it 's hard to say . " international pressure forcing cuba to make gestures the international pressure on castro to release prisoners has increased dramatically since orlando zapata tamayo , one of the dissidents captured in the 2003 purge , died from a hunger strike in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farinas ' hunger strike will resume if promises are broken his death caused outrage and forced raul castro to make a public statement of regret .
tamayo 's death prompted a second prisoner , guillermo farinas , to begin his own hunger strike .
it is thought that farinas ' demands - which included the release of 24 ailing fellow political prisoners - in addition to growing international condemnation , led to the freeing of the 52 . " the death of tamayo was a huge blow to the international reputation of cuba , " said maihold .
" again , castro attempted to limit the damage in the international arena by opening negotiations with the catholic church about the prisoner releases .
he wanted to present the outside world with a humanitarian gesture but in reality , it was designed to ease some of the pressure . " while the decision to release the 52 prisoners was welcomed in washington , prompting the most positive comments by a top administration official to date , the us state department was quick to clarify that havana still needed to do more in areas such as human rights before an end to the 50-year-old trade embargo and a normalization of relations could be considered . washington welcomes move but embargo remains for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinto welcomed the move but refused to talk of the embargo us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters that the latest move by havana was overdue but " a positive sign " and " nevertheless very welcome . " reopening dialogue with cuba has been part of the obama administration 's policy of engagement with its adversaries and last year , the white house lifted travel and money transfer restrictions on cuban-americans with relatives in the caribbean nation . the us president has also said that freeing political prisoners was a precondition for a more rapid improvement in bilateral ties , prompting some observers to suggest that the latest prisoner release could lead to congress approving pending legislation that would end the ban on us citizens travelling to cuba . us remains suspicious of castro and his agenda however , despite a shift in position from that of the previous administration , experts believe that obama has so far only taken modest steps to reverse george w. bush 's policy of increased isolation and tightening of sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to keep castro 's cuba at arm 's length " obama has been quite cautious when dealing with cuba and he has taken a very informal approach , " said maihold .
" he has eased some restrictions on travel and visas but he has n't really committed to anything too serious . " " this prisoner release wo n't be seen by the us as a turning point in relations .
it can be seen as a positive result for obama 's approach but washington has seen steps like this in the past where prisoners were released and in a few months cuba was rounding up people from a different group . this will in no way influence the us to lift the embargo . "
" obama 's approach has not gone very far to normalize relations with cuba as yet , " said sweig .
" however , this prisoner release could neutralize some of the domestic political opposition to his stance on cuba and give him and congress the room to start getting rid of sanctions and accelerate his push for bilateral diplomacy with cuba . " " change regarding the embargo in the us is taking place at about the same speed as the reforms in cuba - which is very slowly .
this is about as much as the domestic political structures in both countries can handle right now , " she added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

swiss justice minister eveline widmer-schlumpf told reporters at a press conference in bern on monday afternoon that the government was unable to ensure that the extradition request was completely valid and without fault .
the swiss questioned whether polanski had already served the necessary time before leaving the united states in 1978 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polanski had been under house arrest at his chalet in switzerland since november " considering the persisting doubts concerning the presentation of the facts of the case , the request has to be rejected , " widmer-schlumpf said .
" the franco-polish filmmaker will not be extradited to the united states and the measures of restriction on his liberty have been lifted . "
polanski 's lawyer herve temime called the decision " an enormous satisfaction and a great relief after the pain suffered by roman polanski and his family . "
illegal sex charges polanski , now 76 , still faces sentencing for unlawful sex with a minor after a 13-year-old girl claimed in 1977 that he raped her .
he was arrested and briefly served time in prison , but fled to france in 1978 , where he has citizenship and has been living since .
the long-running drama was suddenly revived last september when swiss authorities arrested polanski in zurich as he was attending a film festival .
the following november a swiss court released him on bail as long as he remained under house arrest at his home in the resort town of gstaad .
polanski is known for several films including " chinatown " and the cult-classic " rosemary 's baby . "
in 2003 he won the academy award for his direction of the holocaust-themed " the pianist , " but declined to attend the ceremony in los angeles for fear of being arrested .

in a new project in the capital city islamabad , rainwater is now being harvested to address the problem . when heavy rain comes down on the roof of the faisal mosque in islamabad , around 3 million liters of water a day run through its drainage pipes .
the biggest mosque in pakistan and south asia is no longer only an inspiration for believers , it has recently become a source of people 's well-being .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drainage pipes laid to collect water sanullah aman is the director general of the islamabad water management wing . " we have a very comprehensive plan , that no water should be wasted .
we want to save and conserve the water for our future .
and for that we have planned rain harvesting .
we have started a pilot project at the faisal mosque and till now we have been very successful . "
while monitoring wells throughout islamabad over the past two decades , it has been found that the groundwater level has been falling every year by one or two meters .
so the pakistan government in collaboration with the united nations develpoment programme , undp initiated the pilot project at the faisal mosque to harvest the rain water .
abdul majeed from pakistan council of research in water resources says , " i installed this project just a few weeks back .
the salient feature of this project is that i have installed two bore holes .
they are just acting like tube wells .
we pump the water in the tube wells but in these bore holes we are letting the water flow through gravity .
the immediate result that i noticed was a 14 feet rise in the local water table , after 3 days of rain .
so that was a tremendous success . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water reservoirs in a forest near the mosque filtering the rain water according to abdul majeed , the drainage network of the faisal mosque was in place before to protect the building from being flooded .
but instead of wasting the rain water , the water research expert has invented a new system to convert rain water into clean drinking water .
hidden under metal lids in a forest close to the mosque , there are huge reservoirs .
here the water is filtered with the help of sand filter-beds .
after the filter the water runs down vertical pipes up to the ground water level .
according to abdul majeed , the capital development authority , cda is very interested in the project .
" of course the water level will slowly go down again as the water goes into the ground and disappears into different directions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drainage network under the mosque 200 million liters needed every day " so if this technology could be replicated by the cda all over islamabad in different places , where they have a dense network of rainfall collecting systems , it would automatically go into the ground and recharge the aquifers.the cda chairman was very excited after seeing the project demonstartion and said that they would replicate this project at 100 different places in islamabad . "
islamabad 's two million citizens have a daily consumption of 200 million liters of water .
meanwhile , islamabad 's building code has been amended to include rain water harvesting design specifications for buildings with a footprint of more than 400 square yards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 12.07.2010 us welcomes cuba 's release of dissidents but remains suspicious großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the release is unlikely to solve the rift in cuba-us relations the release of 52 political prisoners by cuba has been welcomed by the us but while experts admit that this represents a significant shift , cuba needs to take further steps before relations can be normalized . the decision by cuba to release 52 political prisoners has been welcomed by officials in the united states and the european union but while politicians on both sides of the atlantic admit that the move represents a significant shift , the communist caribbean nation needs to take further steps before negotiations on normalizing relations can begin . the deal to release the prisoners , who were among 75 dissidents rounded up during a major crackdown in march 2003 on anti-state and counter-revolutionary charges , was brokered by spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos and cardinal jaime ortega , head of the roman catholic church in cuba .
the 23 other detainees from the 2003 purge have already been released . a number of released prisoners arrived in spain on tuesday . the united states also agreed to house freed prisoners deported from cuba but issued a statement saying that " those released should be free to decide whether to remain in cuba and those who do leave should be able to return to their country . " the latest prisoner release reduces the number of political prisoners held in cuban jails to 167 , the lowest number since fidel castro took power in 1959 , and some observers believe that the move represents a further shift in policy by the raul castro government . prisoner release eases pressure on castro government julia sweig , the director for latin america studies at the council for foreign relations in washington , believes that the prisoner release could provide cuba with some breathing space to address domestic issues regarding much-needed reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul castro hopes to assuage international pressure " i believe we are seeing a gradual reform of cuba under raul castro , " she told deutsche welle .
" by releasing these prisoners , raul is creating space internationally and domestically to press forward . " professor guenther maihold , an expert on latin american foreign policy and international relations at the german institute for international and security affairs , disagrees .
he says the prisoner release is just a tactic to distract the international community . " this does not represent a real change in cuba 's policies , " maihold told deutsche welle .
" there are still many issues that are troubling to the international community , mainly in the human rights arena , and this prisoner release was engineered to limit the international damage to cuba ’ s foreign policy .
this does n't represent any change within cuba and it is unlikely that we 'll see any domestic changes in terms of rights and democracy . " " what we could see is spain pushing for a change to the eu 's 14-year-old ' common position ' on cuba which demands major political reforms and the release of political prisoners in return for normal relations but whether every eu member state will go with this , it 's hard to say . " international pressure forcing cuba to make gestures the international pressure on castro to release prisoners has increased dramatically since orlando zapata tamayo , one of the dissidents captured in the 2003 purge , died from a hunger strike in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farinas ' hunger strike will resume if promises are broken his death caused outrage and forced raul castro to make a public statement of regret .
tamayo 's death prompted a second prisoner , guillermo farinas , to begin his own hunger strike .
it is thought that farinas ' demands - which included the release of 24 ailing fellow political prisoners - in addition to growing international condemnation , led to the freeing of the 52 . " the death of tamayo was a huge blow to the international reputation of cuba , " said maihold .
" again , castro attempted to limit the damage in the international arena by opening negotiations with the catholic church about the prisoner releases .
he wanted to present the outside world with a humanitarian gesture but in reality , it was designed to ease some of the pressure . " while the decision to release the 52 prisoners was welcomed in washington , prompting the most positive comments by a top administration official to date , the us state department was quick to clarify that havana still needed to do more in areas such as human rights before an end to the 50-year-old trade embargo and a normalization of relations could be considered . washington welcomes move but embargo remains for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinto welcomed the move but refused to talk of the embargo us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters that the latest move by havana was overdue but " a positive sign " and " nevertheless very welcome . " reopening dialogue with cuba has been part of the obama administration 's policy of engagement with its adversaries and last year , the white house lifted travel and money transfer restrictions on cuban-americans with relatives in the caribbean nation . the us president has also said that freeing political prisoners was a precondition for a more rapid improvement in bilateral ties , prompting some observers to suggest that the latest prisoner release could lead to congress approving pending legislation that would end the ban on us citizens travelling to cuba . us remains suspicious of castro and his agenda however , despite a shift in position from that of the previous administration , experts believe that obama has so far only taken modest steps to reverse george w. bush 's policy of increased isolation and tightening of sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to keep castro 's cuba at arm 's length " obama has been quite cautious when dealing with cuba and he has taken a very informal approach , " said maihold .
" he has eased some restrictions on travel and visas but he has n't really committed to anything too serious . " " this prisoner release wo n't be seen by the us as a turning point in relations .
it can be seen as a positive result for obama 's approach but washington has seen steps like this in the past where prisoners were released and in a few months cuba was rounding up people from a different group . this will in no way influence the us to lift the embargo . "
" obama 's approach has not gone very far to normalize relations with cuba as yet , " said sweig .
" however , this prisoner release could neutralize some of the domestic political opposition to his stance on cuba and give him and congress the room to start getting rid of sanctions and accelerate his push for bilateral diplomacy with cuba . " " change regarding the embargo in the us is taking place at about the same speed as the reforms in cuba - which is very slowly .
this is about as much as the domestic political structures in both countries can handle right now , " she added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

forty-four passengers needed medical attention after travelling on a high-speed train with a broken air conditioning system . german police are investigating charges against rail operator deutsche bahn after 44 passengers needed medical attention after travelling on a high-speed train with a broken air conditioning system on the weekend .
near-panic broke out on board the ice train from berlin to cologne on saturday when several high-school students returning from a school trip collapsed and lay unconscious and dehydrated in the aisle .
the train was eventually stopped in the central german town of bielefeld .
" people were already collapsing in the train , and four of our students hyperventilated when they stepped out onto the platform , " said distressed teacher dagmar reichenberg-arnoldy , as emergency doctors attended to her class on the platform .
three trains were affected , nine students and elderly passengers ended up in hospital and a pregnant woman tried to smash a window with an emergency hammer in desperation .
with outside temperatures of up to 38 degrees celsius , a broken air-conditioning system and sealed windows , temperatures within reportedly reached up to 50 degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruediger grube promised compensation damage control deutsche bahn 's public relations department quickly attempted some damage control , with boss ruediger grube promising compensation .
spokesman juergen kornmann appealed for the public to put saturday 's events in perspective .
" we operate 1,400 inter-city connections every day , and yesterday we had problems - big problems i admit - on three of the trains , " he said .
" so one can see the vast majority of travelers arrive safely and comfortably . "
but these justifications have not prevented saturday 's events from catching the attention of the police , who announced that they have begun investigations into deutsche bahn on suspicion of causing bodily harm by negligence .
a police spokeswoman said the problem with the air-conditioning had been known well before the train was stopped in bielefeld .
endemic problems ?
meanwhile , passengers on other trains have since come forward to report problems on other trains .
oliver rasche , who was travelling on a stretch from bochum to berlin on saturday , complained about the way deutsche bahn handled the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temperature inside the train was estimated at 50 degrees celsius " there was no official reaction or official announcement at all that the train was damaged or that the air-conditioning was not working , " he said .
" you just realized it was getting hotter and hotter . "
dirty filters , causing the air-conditioning to overheat and shut itself down , have been blamed for the problems , and karl-peter naumann of public transport passenger organization pro bahn believes cost-cutting schemes in deutsche bahn 's maintenance department have caused endemic problems .
" i think that parts relevant to safety - the wheels and the axles - are being cared for very thoroughly , but i 'm afraid that means the air-conditioning system is neglected , " he told german broadcaster ntv .
if saturday 's dramatic events are traced to a lack of maintenance in on-board systems , deutsche bahn could face serious legal trouble .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals spain lifts first world cup , beating the netherlands world cup -pipe- 12.07.2010 spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a world cup to remember for uruguay 's forlan the golden ball , the golden boot and whatever the world cup trophy is supposed to represent have all been handed out .
but who will make deutsche welle 's list of the best 11 in south africa ? the jury for deutsche welle 's top xi consisted of sports editor matt hermann , reporters nick amies and jefferson chase and a special guest .
this year , dw-tv moderator , political expert and renaissance man peter craven joined the fray .
the rules were simple .
four guys , each with one vote per position , come up with the super-duper starting lineup .
four being an even number , we also introduced a tiebreaker .
in case of two of more players being judged relatively equal , the one with the best hair got the nod .
so without any further ado , and staying with the hair theme , here are our picks .
diego and david bildunterschrift : at dw , we 're big fans of forlan peter made an impassioned plea for miroslav klose to be included , in response to jefferson arguing that a fair number of his 14 career world cup goals were tap-ins .
but ultimately , miro had to take a back seat to two of the best players of the tournament .
the first is diego forlan , the uruguay forward who was deservedly named the world cup mvp .
as matt putt it , " he played on a defensively minded team that offered only intermittent support and was the heart and soul throughout . "
normally , we hate football players with loads of talent and swept-back , movie-star blond locks .
but forlan also seemed like a genuinely nice guy when interviewed and played in the true spirit of the beautiful game .
so diego , if you 're ever in berlin , bonn or brussels , we 'd like to buy you a beer .
slightly less likeable but no less prodigious was spain 's david villa .
the diminutive forward kept the spanish in the tournament when they stumbled early on and scored an outrageous goal from just inside the halfway line against chile .
plus he gets extra points for the frank zappa-esque goatee thing .
tommy , schweini , wesley and xavi bildunterschrift : twenty-year-old thomas mueller was the man against argentina the 2010 world cup was a midfielders ' tournament , and ghana 's kevin-prince boateng and japan 's honda drew kudos from the jury .
but ultimately there was consensus on who the middle four should be .
twenty-year-old thomas mueller made everyone 's list .
at an age where most young men 's greatest life achievement involves a fifth of jack daniel 's and a funnel , the german world cup debutant picked up the golden boot and , almost as an afterthought , the best young player award .
his teammate bastian schweinsteiger also swept our ballots for holding midfielder .
we were impressed not only with his presence in midfield but also his leadership qualities , which were one reason germany recovered so well from the loss of captain michael ballack to injury .
the netherlands ' wesley sneijder was a somewhat more curious case .
he never seemed to do anything all that spectacular but ended the world cup with five goals .
as nick put it , " he kind of embodies the dutch approach of players who are really talented and really mouthy - i like that . "
bildunterschrift : xavi is our midfield leader that left one big question : who to take from spain ?
the options , obviously , were xavi or iniesta , but that was like asking a hardcore radiohead fan to say whether " ok computer " or " kid a " is a better album .
iniesta scored two crucial goals , while xavi looked more like the true field general and delivered the pinpoint corner kick that propelled spain past germany .
in the end , xavi won on the hair rule .
iniesta has hardly any , while xavi 's michael corleone slick-back perfectly reflects his ruthless strategic acumen on the pitch .
king poodle and consorts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fine example of the hair rule in action left and right back were relatively easy choices .
spain may not have had the greatest offense , but sergio ramos attracted everyone 's votes for being a constant source of pressure up the left flank .
he was also solid defensively , as spain shut out their final four opponents .
meanwhile , maicon did on the right what ramos did on the left .
no opposing defense really had an answer for the burly brazilian , who is much bigger than most players at his position .
as peter succinctly put it , " the selecao disappointed ; maicon did not . "
selecting central defenders was harder , but we felt we had to pay tribute to new zealand 's ryan nelsen .
" he 's a player with limited gifts , but was at the heart of an amazing campaign , " matt pointed out .
" three games , 270 minutes of white-knuckle defending , one goal conceded .
class . "
we were all over the shop , though , when it came to picking nelsen 's partner .
among the candidates we looked at were friedrich , lugano , pique and lucio .
but in the end , one man stood out from the pack .
he 's been called the caveman and king poodle , but presumably never to his face .
spain 's carlos puyol has been around as long as any of us can remember , and his 2010 performance was as gritty , controlled and clutch as any he has ever turned in .
plus , he 's got the best hair since carlos valderrama .
bildunterschrift : stekelenburg was the netherlands ' flying dutchman who should be between the posts was an even tougher call .
the wacky world cup ball meant that the goalkeepers were pretty tentative , and little separated spain 's iker cassilas , germany 's manuel neuer and holland 's maarten stekelenburg .
but stekelenburg was our ultimate choice .
in nick 's words : " the dutch tended to panic in the last six meters before goal , and they were lucky they had such an agile , intelligent keeper who was on the ball . "
the netherlands would in fact have never made the finals had the lanky dutchman not diverted a short by kaka in their quarterfinal against brazil , when the selecao were leading 1-0 .
so we think he makes a fine addition to a cast of 11 that outshone all others in south africa .
so from all of us to all of you : nice work , guys .
and to carlos puyol in particular : love the hair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 12.07.2010 us welcomes cuba 's release of dissidents but remains suspicious großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the release is unlikely to solve the rift in cuba-us relations the release of 52 political prisoners by cuba has been welcomed by the us but while experts admit that this represents a significant shift , cuba needs to take further steps before relations can be normalized . the decision by cuba to release 52 political prisoners has been welcomed by officials in the united states and the european union but while politicians on both sides of the atlantic admit that the move represents a significant shift , the communist caribbean nation needs to take further steps before negotiations on normalizing relations can begin . the deal to release the prisoners , who were among 75 dissidents rounded up during a major crackdown in march 2003 on anti-state and counter-revolutionary charges , was brokered by spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos and cardinal jaime ortega , head of the roman catholic church in cuba .
the 23 other detainees from the 2003 purge have already been released . a number of released prisoners arrived in spain on tuesday . the united states also agreed to house freed prisoners deported from cuba but issued a statement saying that " those released should be free to decide whether to remain in cuba and those who do leave should be able to return to their country . " the latest prisoner release reduces the number of political prisoners held in cuban jails to 167 , the lowest number since fidel castro took power in 1959 , and some observers believe that the move represents a further shift in policy by the raul castro government . prisoner release eases pressure on castro government julia sweig , the director for latin america studies at the council for foreign relations in washington , believes that the prisoner release could provide cuba with some breathing space to address domestic issues regarding much-needed reforms . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : raul castro hopes to assuage international pressure " i believe we are seeing a gradual reform of cuba under raul castro , " she told deutsche welle .
" by releasing these prisoners , raul is creating space internationally and domestically to press forward . " professor guenther maihold , an expert on latin american foreign policy and international relations at the german institute for international and security affairs , disagrees .
he says the prisoner release is just a tactic to distract the international community . " this does not represent a real change in cuba 's policies , " maihold told deutsche welle .
" there are still many issues that are troubling to the international community , mainly in the human rights arena , and this prisoner release was engineered to limit the international damage to cuba ’ s foreign policy .
this does n't represent any change within cuba and it is unlikely that we 'll see any domestic changes in terms of rights and democracy . " " what we could see is spain pushing for a change to the eu 's 14-year-old ' common position ' on cuba which demands major political reforms and the release of political prisoners in return for normal relations but whether every eu member state will go with this , it 's hard to say . " international pressure forcing cuba to make gestures the international pressure on castro to release prisoners has increased dramatically since orlando zapata tamayo , one of the dissidents captured in the 2003 purge , died from a hunger strike in february . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farinas ' hunger strike will resume if promises are broken his death caused outrage and forced raul castro to make a public statement of regret .
tamayo 's death prompted a second prisoner , guillermo farinas , to begin his own hunger strike .
it is thought that farinas ' demands - which included the release of 24 ailing fellow political prisoners - in addition to growing international condemnation , led to the freeing of the 52 . " the death of tamayo was a huge blow to the international reputation of cuba , " said maihold .
" again , castro attempted to limit the damage in the international arena by opening negotiations with the catholic church about the prisoner releases .
he wanted to present the outside world with a humanitarian gesture but in reality , it was designed to ease some of the pressure . " while the decision to release the 52 prisoners was welcomed in washington , prompting the most positive comments by a top administration official to date , the us state department was quick to clarify that havana still needed to do more in areas such as human rights before an end to the 50-year-old trade embargo and a normalization of relations could be considered . washington welcomes move but embargo remains for now bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinto welcomed the move but refused to talk of the embargo us secretary of state hillary clinton told reporters that the latest move by havana was overdue but " a positive sign " and " nevertheless very welcome . " reopening dialogue with cuba has been part of the obama administration 's policy of engagement with its adversaries and last year , the white house lifted travel and money transfer restrictions on cuban-americans with relatives in the caribbean nation . the us president has also said that freeing political prisoners was a precondition for a more rapid improvement in bilateral ties , prompting some observers to suggest that the latest prisoner release could lead to congress approving pending legislation that would end the ban on us citizens travelling to cuba . us remains suspicious of castro and his agenda however , despite a shift in position from that of the previous administration , experts believe that obama has so far only taken modest steps to reverse george w. bush 's policy of increased isolation and tightening of sanctions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama is expected to keep castro 's cuba at arm 's length " obama has been quite cautious when dealing with cuba and he has taken a very informal approach , " said maihold .
" he has eased some restrictions on travel and visas but he has n't really committed to anything too serious . " " this prisoner release wo n't be seen by the us as a turning point in relations .
it can be seen as a positive result for obama 's approach but washington has seen steps like this in the past where prisoners were released and in a few months cuba was rounding up people from a different group . this will in no way influence the us to lift the embargo . "
" obama 's approach has not gone very far to normalize relations with cuba as yet , " said sweig .
" however , this prisoner release could neutralize some of the domestic political opposition to his stance on cuba and give him and congress the room to start getting rid of sanctions and accelerate his push for bilateral diplomacy with cuba . " " change regarding the embargo in the us is taking place at about the same speed as the reforms in cuba - which is very slowly .
this is about as much as the domestic political structures in both countries can handle right now , " she added . author : nick amies editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 12.07.2010 gazprom courts rwe on controversial pipeline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how important are the planned new gas pipelines ?
the russian energy giant is reportedly offering germany 's rwe a role in its south stream pipeline venture to supply natural gas to europe .
but rwe is already a key member of the rival nabucco project . executives at russian energy giant gazprom have approached german energy concern rwe to discuss the prospect of it joining the russian-led south stream project .
" it was just a preliminary discussion , nothing concrete , " a gazprom source told reuters .
" they are interested in entering the project . "
rwe declined to comment on the talks , saying only that the rival nabucco pipeline " is the best project for rwe at the moment . "
rival pipelines the south stream pipeline is to carry up to 63 billion cubic meters of russian gas a year across the black sea to bulgaria , where it will split into two paths to be built by gazprom jointly with local partners .
by comparison , the 3,300 kilometer nabucco pipleline is planned to have an annual capacity of 31 billion cubic meters .
it will transport central asian gas to europe using a route that leads through turkey , bulgaria , romania , hungary and austria - and bypassing russia .
current partners in the nabucco project are bulgarian energy holding , turkey 's botas , hungary 's mol and romania 's transgaz , in addition to rwe and austrian power company omv .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom hopes to dominate the flow of gas to europe gazprom has been talking to other european energy companies about south stream .
it has won over italy 's eni and france 's edf as well as omv , which plans to participate in both pipeline projects .
it is unclear whether or not rwe intends to follow omv and have a foot in both camps . some analysts believe the german company may do just that .
leading partners " rwe and omv are leading partners in the nabucco project , " graham freedman , senior energy analyst with market research and consulting company wood mackenzie in london , told deutsche welle .
" i 'm sure the two are talking together .
they 're probably looking at the potential for each of the projects . "
a decision by rwe to pull out of nabucco and join south stream could severely weaken or even put a complete end to nabucco , freedman warns .
" rwe was brought into the consortium originally as a large aggregator of gas - a big utility based in germany , which is effectively the end point for nabucco , " he said .
" i think -lsb- it -rsb- would deal quite a large blow to nabucco if rwe were to leave the consortium . "
nabucco has been slow to get off the ground , largely due to the venture 's struggles to find a sufficient base of natural gas suppliers .
but the european union is particularly keen to see nabucco become a reality to reduce what it and many of its member states view as a growing dependency on russian natural gas .
today , a quarter of the gas consumed in the eu comes from russia , which is expected to produce more than a third within the next few years .
world 's largest gas reservoir a key driver of that growth is the nord stream pipeline venture , which will transport russian gas through a pipeline passing through russian , finnish , swedish and german waters .
it will connect western european markets to siberia 's shtokmanovskoye field , the world 's largest gas reservoir , among other russian gas fields .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's rwe says it is committed to the nabucco pipeline diversification of gas regions and pipelines is important , according to claudia kemfert of the german institute for economic research .
and in that context , " nabucco has a key role , " she told deutsche welle .
but kemfert is n't overly surprised by the talks between gazprom and rwe .
" i can understand the companies who would like to go for a safe strategy , and russia is a more safe strategy , " she said .
" nabucco has a lot of uncertainties , " which companies like rwe and omv need to assess .
hedge their bets while european power companies may be tempted to hedge their bets by participating in the two rival pipeline ventures , kemfert warned that supporting both could severely drain management and financial resources .
georg zachmann of the think-tank bruegel is skeptical about both projects .
he warns of a " gas glut " in europe .
the region , he said , is receiving increasing volumes of liquefied natural gas from the middle east .
meanwhile the united states , a big consumer of natural gas , has been importing little or no gas from world markets since it tapped into rich shale gas deposits formed among layers of sedimentary rock .
in the short and mid-term , zachmann said , " everything points in the direction of oversupply in the european market , " raising questions why anyone would want to invest " in a new expensive pipeline through various countries with the aim to discipline the pricing behavior of monopolies . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals spain lifts first world cup , beating the netherlands world cup -pipe- 12.07.2010 spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it was a world cup to remember for uruguay 's forlan the golden ball , the golden boot and whatever the world cup trophy is supposed to represent have all been handed out .
but who will make deutsche welle 's list of the best 11 in south africa ? the jury for deutsche welle 's top xi consisted of sports editor matt hermann , reporters nick amies and jefferson chase and a special guest .
this year , dw-tv moderator , political expert and renaissance man peter craven joined the fray .
the rules were simple .
four guys , each with one vote per position , come up with the super-duper starting lineup .
four being an even number , we also introduced a tiebreaker .
in case of two of more players being judged relatively equal , the one with the best hair got the nod .
so without any further ado , and staying with the hair theme , here are our picks .
diego and david bildunterschrift : at dw , we 're big fans of forlan peter made an impassioned plea for miroslav klose to be included , in response to jefferson arguing that a fair number of his 14 career world cup goals were tap-ins .
but ultimately , miro had to take a back seat to two of the best players of the tournament .
the first is diego forlan , the uruguay forward who was deservedly named the world cup mvp .
as matt putt it , " he played on a defensively minded team that offered only intermittent support and was the heart and soul throughout . "
normally , we hate football players with loads of talent and swept-back , movie-star blond locks .
but forlan also seemed like a genuinely nice guy when interviewed and played in the true spirit of the beautiful game .
so diego , if you 're ever in berlin , bonn or brussels , we 'd like to buy you a beer .
slightly less likeable but no less prodigious was spain 's david villa .
the diminutive forward kept the spanish in the tournament when they stumbled early on and scored an outrageous goal from just inside the halfway line against chile .
plus he gets extra points for the frank zappa-esque goatee thing .
tommy , schweini , wesley and xavi bildunterschrift : twenty-year-old thomas mueller was the man against argentina the 2010 world cup was a midfielders ' tournament , and ghana 's kevin-prince boateng and japan 's honda drew kudos from the jury .
but ultimately there was consensus on who the middle four should be .
twenty-year-old thomas mueller made everyone 's list .
at an age where most young men 's greatest life achievement involves a fifth of jack daniel 's and a funnel , the german world cup debutant picked up the golden boot and , almost as an afterthought , the best young player award .
his teammate bastian schweinsteiger also swept our ballots for holding midfielder .
we were impressed not only with his presence in midfield but also his leadership qualities , which were one reason germany recovered so well from the loss of captain michael ballack to injury .
the netherlands ' wesley sneijder was a somewhat more curious case .
he never seemed to do anything all that spectacular but ended the world cup with five goals .
as nick put it , " he kind of embodies the dutch approach of players who are really talented and really mouthy - i like that . "
bildunterschrift : xavi is our midfield leader that left one big question : who to take from spain ?
the options , obviously , were xavi or iniesta , but that was like asking a hardcore radiohead fan to say whether " ok computer " or " kid a " is a better album .
iniesta scored two crucial goals , while xavi looked more like the true field general and delivered the pinpoint corner kick that propelled spain past germany .
in the end , xavi won on the hair rule .
iniesta has hardly any , while xavi 's michael corleone slick-back perfectly reflects his ruthless strategic acumen on the pitch .
king poodle and consorts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fine example of the hair rule in action left and right back were relatively easy choices .
spain may not have had the greatest offense , but sergio ramos attracted everyone 's votes for being a constant source of pressure up the left flank .
he was also solid defensively , as spain shut out their final four opponents .
meanwhile , maicon did on the right what ramos did on the left .
no opposing defense really had an answer for the burly brazilian , who is much bigger than most players at his position .
as peter succinctly put it , " the selecao disappointed ; maicon did not . "
selecting central defenders was harder , but we felt we had to pay tribute to new zealand 's ryan nelsen .
" he 's a player with limited gifts , but was at the heart of an amazing campaign , " matt pointed out .
" three games , 270 minutes of white-knuckle defending , one goal conceded .
class . "
we were all over the shop , though , when it came to picking nelsen 's partner .
among the candidates we looked at were friedrich , lugano , pique and lucio .
but in the end , one man stood out from the pack .
he 's been called the caveman and king poodle , but presumably never to his face .
spain 's carlos puyol has been around as long as any of us can remember , and his 2010 performance was as gritty , controlled and clutch as any he has ever turned in .
plus , he 's got the best hair since carlos valderrama .
bildunterschrift : stekelenburg was the netherlands ' flying dutchman who should be between the posts was an even tougher call .
the wacky world cup ball meant that the goalkeepers were pretty tentative , and little separated spain 's iker cassilas , germany 's manuel neuer and holland 's maarten stekelenburg .
but stekelenburg was our ultimate choice .
in nick 's words : " the dutch tended to panic in the last six meters before goal , and they were lucky they had such an agile , intelligent keeper who was on the ball . "
the netherlands would in fact have never made the finals had the lanky dutchman not diverted a short by kaka in their quarterfinal against brazil , when the selecao were leading 1-0 .
so we think he makes a fine addition to a cast of 11 that outshone all others in south africa .
so from all of us to all of you : nice work , guys .
and to carlos puyol in particular : love the hair .

the team 's refreshing brand of offensive soccer inspired fans of the sport worldwide and made many rethink the way they perceive not only german football , but also germany itself .
germany repeated its placing from 2006 , the tournament it hosted , by prevailing 3-2 over a determined uruguay team in saturday 's match for third place .
" we 're not going back home to germany empty-handed , but with a third place finish , which the team has earned , " said national team head coach joachim loew , the architect of germany 's 2010 showing .
during the 2006 world cup , germany showed itself as a friendly and cosmopolitan country , and the event was widely regarded as an overwhelming success from both the organizational and entertainment points of view .
this year , the national team earned the world 's respect with its exciting , high-scoring style of football .
" abroad , this team is perceived as being very likeable , " said newly elected german president christian wulff , who flew to south africa to watch his country play uruguay .
" some africans have told me this team is something of a ' rainbow ' team , diverse and convincing , " he said .
the stirring performance has even led to a recommendation by wulff that loew receive the federal cross of merit for service to the nation , and that the team be awarded the silver bay laurel leaf , the highest sports award in germany .
" the team is the best ambassador germany has in the world , " wulff added .
german soccer legend franz beckenbauer also praised the national team .
" the mood in south africa was euphoric , and many people have told me that the german team has been the best , " he said .
national team manager and former striker oliver bierhoff gleaned a similarly positive message from the tournament .
" we have managed to create a new picture of germany , not only in a sporting sense , but also socially , " he said .
bildunterschrift : germany 's young , multicultural squad celebrated a second consecutive third place finish youthful team shines without ballack the sense of just how much bastian schweinsteiger , philipp lahm , thomas mueller and co. have changed the way germany is perceived can not be overstated .
no longer will there be comparisons between the national team and tanks , but rather respect and recognition for what was regarded as a thrilling and youthful way of playing football .
" in my opinion this is the best team with the most quality of all the national teams i 've played on up until now , " said lahm , who was given the captain 's armband for the tournament in the absence of the injured michael ballack .
the loss of ballack , germany 's lone yet aging superstar , caused a lot of stress among german fans in the weeks leading up to the world cup .
but the absence of the new bayer leverkusen midfielder turned out to be an opportunity for the national team to reinvent itself .
ballack said he was watching with amazement as his young countrymen put in some memorable performances in south africa , particularly the 4-0 thrashing of diego maradona 's argentina .
" it 's scary that such a young team could take a classy team like argentina , " he said .
goals galore germany also put in great performances against australia , england and uruguay , though group stage games against serbia and ghana left a little to be desired .
the team finished with a goal tally of 16 over seven games , having conceded five .
what 's more , mueller , 20 , picked up the golden boot award with five of those goals and three assists .
mueller also took the award for best young player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semifinal disappointment soon turned to third-place pride for german fans after slotting home eight goals in two games against england and argentina , many pundits were tipping germany to go all the way , but the eventual champions spain proved an insurmountable obstacle .
the swedish newspaper aftonbladet summed up germany 's 1-0 semifinal loss to la furia roja with this comment : " an attractive , young germany required two years -lrb- from the euro 2008 loss to spain -rrb- to rehearse its own variation of spectacular spanish football .
spain needed 90 minutes to show that the germans are not yet the finished product . "
this was a point touched on by schweinsteiger , who himself had an excellent world cup as assistant captain : " we have many young players , who have a big future ahead of them .
they have now gathered a lot of experience from their first tournament .
that is good for future tournaments . "
in addition to being young and relatively unknown outside of germany , the team has also been the subject of much attention due to its multicultural makeup .
eleven of the 23 players on the world cup squad , including mesut oezil , sami khedira and jerome boateng , have roots overseas .
bundesliga in focus with their strong performances in south africa , the german players have boosted their transfer values and fueled the rumor mill .
no day of the world cup went by without players being linked with europe 's top clubs .
mesut oezil in particular is hot property .
five clubs - fc barcelona , manchester city , manchester united , fc valencia and fc arsenal - have apparently expressed interest in securing the playmaker 's transfer from werder bremen .
schweinsteiger hopes , however , that the dazzling performances of the bundesliga players will have the reverse effect .
" we have done the bundesliga proud .
in the future , the biggest players will come to germany , " the midfielder speculated .
loew 's future still uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and his assistant hansi flick 's lucky sweaters took the side far even though a fourth world cup title ultimately eluded germany , loew earned brownie points as the architect of german football 's renaissance in the world 's eyes .
theo zwanziger , president of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , wants to keep the national coach in the job .
" you can trust that i will do everything in my power to make sure that the coaching staff can take this team into the future , " he said .
yet the coach himself has kept a low profile so far .
it still apparently frustrates him that contract talks with the dfb broke down before the tournament .
" after the world cup , i need two or three days to get my thoughts in order .
and then i will certainly have several ideas and visions on how to go on further , " loew said .
he already has the next goal clearly in his sights .
by the 2012 european championship in poland and ukraine , or at the latest at the 2014 world cup in brazil , he wants to win a title .
philipp lahm is also confident about success in the future .
" as you have already seen at past tournaments , we are always in the running for the title , " he said .

the trial was fiercely criticized by human rights activists .
art expert andrei yerofeyev and former museum director yury samodurov had set up the forbidden art exhibition at the andrei sakharov museum of moscow in 2007 , a museum devoted to the former soviet dissident and nobel peace prize winner who died in 1989 .
museum of moscow in 2007 .
the show included a depiction of jesus christ with a mickey mouse head and a spoof coca-cola ad carrying the slogan , " this is my blood . "
the exhibition was condemned by the russian orthodox church .
an ultra-nationalist orthodox group filed a complaint , and prosecutors opened an investigation into the show .
the two men were subsequently charged with inciting religious hatred .
yerofeyev protested that the show was not deliberately anti-christian , but that it was simply a protest about cultural censorship .
" i thought that this would cause controversy with the ministry of culture and other institutions , " he told news agency afp ahead of the ruling .
" but not within the church or with fascists .
" society is sick .
it still has problems with its reflection in the mirror , art , " he added .
the judge found the men guilty , saying they had " committed actions aimed at inciting hatred . "
yerofeyev and samodurov could have been sentenced to up to three years in prison , but were instead ordered to pay fines of up to 200,000 rubles -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- .former museum director yury samodurov said the guilty verdict was a return to soviet or tsarist times : " from now on any exhibition that shows religious symbols in a non-religious context , expressing a non-relgious meaning , is forbidden .
it means the use of religious symbols in art is being seen as a crime against faith " , samodurov told deutsche welle .
last week 13 russian artists published an open letter to president dmitry medvedev asking him to end the trial .
they said a guilty verdict would be a " sentence for the whole of russian contemporary art " and " another step towards the introduction of cultural censorship . "

" some africans have told me this team is something of a ' rainbow ' team , diverse and convincing , " he said .
the stirring performance has even led to a recommendation by wulff that loew receive the federal cross of merit for service to the nation , and that the team be awarded the silver bay laurel leaf , the highest sports award in germany .
" the team is the best ambassador germany has in the world , " wulff added .
german soccer legend franz beckenbauer also praised the national team .
" the mood in south africa was euphoric , and many people have told me that the german team has been the best , " he said .
national team manager and former striker oliver bierhoff gleaned a similarly positive message from the tournament .
" we have managed to create a new picture of germany , not only in a sporting sense , but also socially , " he said .

no longer will there be comparisons between the national team and tanks , but rather respect and recognition for what was regarded as a thrilling and youthful way of playing football .
" in my opinion this is the best team with the most quality of all the national teams i 've played on up until now , " said lahm , who was given the captain 's armband for the tournament in the absence of the injured michael ballack .
the loss of ballack , germany 's lone yet aging superstar , caused a lot of stress among german fans in the weeks leading up to the world cup .
but the absence of the new bayer leverkusen midfielder turned out to be an opportunity for the national team to reinvent itself .
ballack said he was watching with amazement as his young countrymen put in some memorable performances in south africa , particularly the 4-0 thrashing of diego maradona 's argentina .
" it 's scary that such a young team could take a classy team like argentina , " he said .
goals galore germany also put in great performances against australia , england and uruguay , though group stage games against serbia and ghana left a little to be desired .
the team finished with a goal tally of 16 over seven games , having conceded five .
what 's more , mueller , 20 , picked up the golden boot award with five of those goals and three assists .
mueller also took the award for best young player .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : semifinal disappointment soon turned to third-place pride for german fans after slotting home eight goals in two games against england and argentina , many pundits were tipping germany to go all the way , but the eventual champions spain proved an insurmountable obstacle .
the swedish newspaper aftonbladet summed up germany 's 1-0 semifinal loss to la furia roja with this comment : " an attractive , young germany required two years -lrb- from the euro 2008 loss to spain -rrb- to rehearse its own variation of spectacular spanish football .
spain needed 90 minutes to show that the germans are not yet the finished product . "
this was a point touched on by schweinsteiger , who himself had an excellent world cup as assistant captain : " we have many young players , who have a big future ahead of them .
they have now gathered a lot of experience from their first tournament .
that is good for future tournaments . "
in addition to being young and relatively unknown outside of germany , the team has also been the subject of much attention due to its multicultural makeup .
eleven of the 23 players on the world cup squad , including mesut oezil , sami khedira and jerome boateng , have roots overseas .
bundesliga in focus with their strong performances in south africa , the german players have boosted their transfer values and fueled the rumor mill .
no day of the world cup went by without players being linked with europe 's top clubs .
mesut oezil in particular is hot property .
five clubs - fc barcelona , manchester city , manchester united , fc valencia and fc arsenal - have apparently expressed interest in securing the playmaker 's transfer from werder bremen .
schweinsteiger hopes , however , that the dazzling performances of the bundesliga players will have the reverse effect .
" we have done the bundesliga proud .
in the future , the biggest players will come to germany , " the midfielder speculated .
loew 's future still uncertain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loew and his assistant hansi flick 's lucky sweaters took the side far even though a fourth world cup title ultimately eluded germany , loew earned brownie points as the architect of german football 's renaissance in the world 's eyes .
theo zwanziger , president of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- , wants to keep the national coach in the job .
" you can trust that i will do everything in my power to make sure that the coaching staff can take this team into the future , " he said .
yet the coach himself has kept a low profile so far .
it still apparently frustrates him that contract talks with the dfb broke down before the tournament .
" after the world cup , i need two or three days to get my thoughts in order .
and then i will certainly have several ideas and visions on how to go on further , " loew said .
he already has the next goal clearly in his sights .
by the 2012 european championship in poland and ukraine , or at the latest at the 2014 world cup in brazil , he wants to win a title .
philipp lahm is also confident about success in the future .
" as you have already seen at past tournaments , we are always in the running for the title , " he said .

without naming specific military officers , retired general giora eiland told reporters in tel aviv on monday that " mistakes were made in the various decisions taken , including within relatively senior ranks , which contributed to the result not being as we would have wished . "
eiland led an internal investigation into the may 31 raid of a turkish-owned flotilla carrying aid supplies to the gaza strip , which israel has largely sealed off because it is controlled by the radical islamist and anti-israel group hamas .
passengers of the boat attacked the israeli soldiers as they landed , and the soldiers opened fire on the crowd , killing eight turkish citizens and one turkish-american dual citizen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raid occurred off the gaza strip in international waters the eiland committee was israel 's response to a global backlash against israel and calls for an international probe .
israel decided to conduct its own investigation instead .
intelligence errors despite its admission of mistakes , the investigation cleared the commandos who conducted the raid of any wrongdoing and said their use of live fire was " justified " because their lives were in danger .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raid occurred off the gaza strip in international waters the eiland committee was israel 's response to a global backlash against israel and calls for an international probe .
israel decided to conduct its own investigation instead .
intelligence errors despite its admission of mistakes , the investigation cleared the commandos who conducted the raid of any wrongdoing and said their use of live fire was " justified " because their lives were in danger .
chief of staff gabi ashkenazi said in a statement that the probe found no evidence of " negligence . "
" neither i nor the investigating team detected any omission or negligence , but certainly , in an investigation as thorough as this , errors were found which must be corrected in the future , " he said .
the committee also found evidence of poor information sharing between various state intelligence agencies , and that the navy had underestimated the threat of violence by the activists on board the ship .

forty-four passengers needed medical attention after travelling on a high-speed train with a broken air conditioning system . german police are investigating charges against rail operator deutsche bahn after 44 passengers needed medical attention after travelling on a high-speed train with a broken air conditioning system on the weekend .
near-panic broke out on board the ice train from berlin to cologne on saturday when several high-school students returning from a school trip collapsed and lay unconscious and dehydrated in the aisle .
the train was eventually stopped in the central german town of bielefeld .
" people were already collapsing in the train , and four of our students hyperventilated when they stepped out onto the platform , " said distressed teacher dagmar reichenberg-arnoldy , as emergency doctors attended to her class on the platform .
three trains were affected , nine students and elderly passengers ended up in hospital and a pregnant woman tried to smash a window with an emergency hammer in desperation .
with outside temperatures of up to 38 degrees celsius , a broken air-conditioning system and sealed windows , temperatures within reportedly reached up to 50 degrees .

" so one can see the vast majority of travelers arrive safely and comfortably . "
but these justifications have not prevented saturday 's events from catching the attention of the police , who announced that they have begun investigations into deutsche bahn on suspicion of causing bodily harm by negligence .

dirty filters , causing the air-conditioning to overheat and shut itself down , have been blamed for the problems , and karl-peter naumann of public transport passenger organization pro bahn believes cost-cutting schemes in deutsche bahn 's maintenance department have caused endemic problems .
" i think that parts relevant to safety - the wheels and the axles - are being cared for very thoroughly , but i 'm afraid that means the air-conditioning system is neglected , " he told german broadcaster ntv .
if saturday 's dramatic events are traced to a lack of maintenance in on-board systems , deutsche bahn could face serious legal trouble .

under the rules , the officials are required to report their salary , income from other sources , property owned by them and their family members and investments .

as santos prepares to take over from out-going president álvaro uribe on august 7 , his and his predecessor 's names are expected to feature in hearings at the un human rights council this month on allegations relating to their roles in the illegal killings of civilians .
while serving in the uribe administration as defense minister between 2006 and 2009 , santos was in charge of the military at a time when the colombian army 's alleged policy of murdering civilians in so-called " false positive " killings was at its height .
it is alleged that army units killed civilians to artificially increase the number of combat fatalities in battles against rebel group the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- .
santos was responsible for coordinating uribe 's mission to eradicate colombia of farc and restore security to one of the most violent countries in the world .
the military operation forced farc out of the cities into remote jungle areas , radically reduced the number of killings and kidnappings in urban areas and rescued colombia from becoming a failed state .
the success of uribe 's mission cemented his popularity and created his reputation among many as the man who saved colombia .
missing civilians linked to expanding war on farc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian troops are accused of killing civilians as farc rebels however , human rights campaigners and international investigators were first alerted to a dark by-product of uribe 's campaign by accusations from families of missing men who claimed that the massive gains the colombian military were making against farc were being boosted by the " false positive " killings of innocent civilians .
the allegations and subsequent investigations led to the removal of the chief of the colombian military and 27 of his officers but santos was spared .
the colombian government has since taken further steps to prevent such killings but , according to un statistics , up to 98.5 percent remain unpunished .
santos continues to claim the killings were the acts of individual soldiers and units and were not sanctioned by the defense ministry .
un investigators remain unconvinced .
" there have been too many killings of a similar nature to characterize them as isolated incidents carried out by individual rogue soldiers or units , or ' bad apples ' , " philip alston , the un 's special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings wrote in a report presented to the un human rights council on june 3 .
" soldiers simply knew that they could get away with murder . "
poor people executed as rebels to boost casualty figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all farc deaths were rebel victims one of the cases being investigated focuses on soacha , a poor suburb of the capital bogotá , and the town of ocaña some 600 kilometers -lrb- 372 miles -rrb- away .
in 2008 , it is alleged that dozens of young men were lured from soacha by paramilitaries and criminals promising employment in ocaña .
once there , they were allegedly sold to colombian army units which executed them as farc guerrillas .
their bodies were then supposedly clothed in military fatigues and draped with weapons and equipment .
the dead were then claimed to be rebel casualties in uribe 's fight against farc .
for the families , this made no sense .
how could the men of soacha , most unable to read or write , others with mental disabilities , transform themselves into uniformed , armed guerrillas ready to take on the battle-hardened colombian military , just days after leaving home ?
" the doctor and the judge said that my son was killed in combat at 2.45am on march 5 , " one mother told deutsche welle .
" his corpse was clothed in camouflage and boots - completely different clothes from what he was wearing when he left . " " the investigations must examine everything , because this can not continue like this , " another anonymous mother from soacha told deutsche welle .
" we will not rest .
this must not go unpunished , although i know that colombia is the land of impunity . " this is just one of the approximately 1,300 cases being examined by investigators from the public prosecutor 's office which suspect military personnel of murdering civilians and claiming they were guerrillas killed in combat in order to win bonuses of up to € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,890 -rrb- per victim .
human rights campaigners suggest that over 2,000 young men were killed and buried in common graves as part of this policy . it is alleged that the kill bonus for units reporting higher enemy body counts , introduced by uribe 's administration in 2005 as part of its intensifying offensive against farc , contributed to the practise of abducting civilians and executing them as rebels .
the large increase of civilian disappearances in colombia can be traced back to this time . former leader claims the ends justified the means in the past , uribe has defended his government 's use of all necessary force to combat farc , saying that the country is safer than ever now due to his crackdown .
his opponents reject his argument that the ends justify the means . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uribe said that the force used to rout farc was justified " the reasoning of the government is completely worn out in my opinion and santos must find alternatives , " camilo gonzalez pozo , director of the colombian institute for the study of development and peace , told deutsche welle .
" the war against farc was the basis for all uribe 's government decisions .
if there was unemployment , farc was to blame for it .
if there were ' false positives ' then farc was to blame for it .
if there were paramilitaries , then farc was to blame for it .
all these arguments have worn themselves out . " with santos unlikely to swerve from uribe 's course of hunting and destroying farc rebels in the jungles of colombia once he becomes president , the memories of what happened in the early years of the operation are unlikely to dissipate .
the anticipated investigations and hearings during this month 's un human rights council session will also keep the topic in the public domain . author : nick amies / gottfried stein editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

forty-four passengers needed medical attention after travelling on a high-speed train with a broken air conditioning system . german police are investigating charges against rail operator deutsche bahn after 44 passengers needed medical attention after travelling on a high-speed train with a broken air conditioning system on the weekend .
near-panic broke out on board the ice train from berlin to cologne on saturday when several high-school students returning from a school trip collapsed and lay unconscious and dehydrated in the aisle .
the train was eventually stopped in the central german town of bielefeld .
" people were already collapsing in the train , and four of our students hyperventilated when they stepped out onto the platform , " said distressed teacher dagmar reichenberg-arnoldy , as emergency doctors attended to her class on the platform .
three trains were affected , nine students and elderly passengers ended up in hospital and a pregnant woman tried to smash a window with an emergency hammer in desperation .
with outside temperatures of up to 38 degrees celsius , a broken air-conditioning system and sealed windows , temperatures within reportedly reached up to 50 degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruediger grube promised compensation damage control deutsche bahn 's public relations department quickly attempted some damage control , with boss ruediger grube promising compensation .

" we operate 1,400 inter-city connections every day , and yesterday we had problems - big problems i admit - on three of the trains , " he said .
" so one can see the vast majority of travelers arrive safely and comfortably . "
but these justifications have not prevented saturday 's events from catching the attention of the police , who announced that they have begun investigations into deutsche bahn on suspicion of causing bodily harm by negligence .

" i think that parts relevant to safety - the wheels and the axles - are being cared for very thoroughly , but i 'm afraid that means the air-conditioning system is neglected , " he told german broadcaster ntv .

forty-four passengers needed medical attention after travelling on a high-speed train with a broken air conditioning system . german police are investigating charges against rail operator deutsche bahn after 44 passengers needed medical attention after travelling on a high-speed train with a broken air conditioning system on the weekend .
near-panic broke out on board the ice train from berlin to cologne on saturday when several high-school students returning from a school trip collapsed and lay unconscious and dehydrated in the aisle .
the train was eventually stopped in the central german town of bielefeld .
" people were already collapsing in the train , and four of our students hyperventilated when they stepped out onto the platform , " said distressed teacher dagmar reichenberg-arnoldy , as emergency doctors attended to her class on the platform .
three trains were affected , nine students and elderly passengers ended up in hospital and a pregnant woman tried to smash a window with an emergency hammer in desperation .
with outside temperatures of up to 38 degrees celsius , a broken air-conditioning system and sealed windows , temperatures within reportedly reached up to 50 degrees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ruediger grube promised compensation damage control deutsche bahn 's public relations department quickly attempted some damage control , with boss ruediger grube promising compensation .
spokesman juergen kornmann appealed for the public to put saturday 's events in perspective .
" we operate 1,400 inter-city connections every day , and yesterday we had problems - big problems i admit - on three of the trains , " he said .
" so one can see the vast majority of travelers arrive safely and comfortably . "
but these justifications have not prevented saturday 's events from catching the attention of the police , who announced that they have begun investigations into deutsche bahn on suspicion of causing bodily harm by negligence .
a police spokeswoman said the problem with the air-conditioning had been known well before the train was stopped in bielefeld .
endemic problems ?
meanwhile , passengers on other trains have since come forward to report problems on other trains .
oliver rasche , who was travelling on a stretch from bochum to berlin on saturday , complained about the way deutsche bahn handled the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the temperature inside the train was estimated at 50 degrees celsius " there was no official reaction or official announcement at all that the train was damaged or that the air-conditioning was not working , " he said .
" you just realized it was getting hotter and hotter . "
dirty filters , causing the air-conditioning to overheat and shut itself down , have been blamed for the problems , and karl-peter naumann of public transport passenger organization pro bahn believes cost-cutting schemes in deutsche bahn 's maintenance department have caused endemic problems .
" i think that parts relevant to safety - the wheels and the axles - are being cared for very thoroughly , but i 'm afraid that means the air-conditioning system is neglected , " he told german broadcaster ntv .
if saturday 's dramatic events are traced to a lack of maintenance in on-board systems , deutsche bahn could face serious legal trouble .

spain scored only eight goals in seven matches , winning each of their four knock-out stage games by a score of 1-0 and setting a new record for the fewest tallies ever by a winner .

striker fernando torres , who was coming off knee surgery , proved to be a shadow of his normal self , rarely capable of getting behind defenses and unable to turn on the ball when he did .
that essentially left spain without an effective center forward , a crucial element in what had been the squad 's free-flowing attack .
the spanish survived the group stage , thanks largely to striker david villa 's individual brilliance , but at that point many people were writing them off .
there was no question that the midfield , anchored by the exceptional xavi and iniesta , would dominate possession and frustrate opponents with their short passing .

villa - whose official height is listed at 1.75 meters -lrb- 5 ' 9 " -rrb- - replaced torres in the middle , while the hole in the squad was filled by diminutive wingers pedro and jesus navas .
the result was something that oddly resembled an italian catenaccio .
spain were n't packing it in at the back , however , as much as they were playing keep-away just inside their opponents ' half .

but to win the ever-elusive big one , the spaniards had to change their style . spain 's ugly 1-0 triumph over the netherlands in johannesburg on sunday was a match most neutral football fans will want to forget as soon as possible .
but the way the spanish claimed the title is truly memorable .
spain scored only eight goals in seven matches , winning each of their four knock-out stage games by a score of 1-0 and setting a new record for the fewest tallies ever by a winner .
to put the numbers in perspective : all previous teams that lifted the trophy scored at least 11 goals .
and in this tournament , third-placed germany found the back of the net twice as often as the spaniards .
indeed , the netherlands , argentina , brazil and even uruguay were more potent offensively than coach vicente del bosque 's men .
with so many of their games coming down to the wire , luck clearly played a role in spain 's first-ever world cup triumph .
but was it accidental ?
not at all .
squad with a flaw bildunterschrift : torres was unable to make a meaningful contribution spain rightly rolled into south africa as one of the pre-tournament favorites .
they were the reigning european champions , having scored 12 goals in 6 matches on their way to the 2008 title and being blessed with a starting midfield drawn exclusively from powerhouses barcelona and real madrid .
but the squad contained a potentially fatal flaw .
striker fernando torres , who was coming off knee surgery , proved to be a shadow of his normal self , rarely capable of getting behind defenses and unable to turn on the ball when he did .
that essentially left spain without an effective center forward , a crucial element in what had been the squad 's free-flowing attack .
the spanish survived the group stage , thanks largely to striker david villa 's individual brilliance , but at that point many people were writing them off .
there was no question that the midfield , anchored by the exceptional xavi and iniesta , would dominate possession and frustrate opponents with their short passing .
but how could spain win if there was no one big up front to serve as a target man ?
strategic adjustment bildunterschrift : villa came up huge the answer lay in a clever , if unorthodox tactical change .
del bosque went even smaller .
villa - whose official height is listed at 1.75 meters -lrb- 5 ' 9 " -rrb- - replaced torres in the middle , while the hole in the squad was filled by diminutive wingers pedro and jesus navas .
the result was something that oddly resembled an italian catenaccio .
spain were n't packing it in at the back , however , as much as they were playing keep-away just inside their opponents ' half .
that made spain less incisive going forward - villa scored the last of his 5 goals -lrb- putting away a rebound off the goalpost -rrb- in the spaniards ' quarterfinal against paraguay .
but the adjustment also put the focus of spain 's remaining matches even more squarely on the midfield , where del bosque had his biggest advantage .
germany and the netherlands ran themselves ragged trying to win the ball back , while spain waited and waited for gaps to open up .
boring , a lot of football fans thought .
but effective .
in every one of their games , spain not only had more possession , but more shots on target than their opponents .
the end of national styles bildunterschrift : xavi , xabi alonso and iniesta anchored a superlative midfield one thing that this world cup made clear in that cliches about how various national teams play the game are in need of serious revision .
historically , spain were always a team that scored a lot and did n't get very far in the world cup .
the spanish teams of 1986 , 1994 and 2002 were twice as productive offensively than the 2010 squad - all were knocked out in the quarterfinals .
the current , more tactically disciplined team is built around an axis of players from barcelona , a club that was for the better part of 11 years -lrb- 1997-2008 -rrb- coached by two dutchmen , louis van gaal and frank rijkaard .
and it was n't just spain that defied stereotypes .
the most attractive offensive team in south africa , germany , featured seven field players from bayern munich , which is now of course coached by van gaal .
conversely , the netherlands came very close to taking this year 's title by abandoning " total football " for a rough-and-tumble style reminiscent of german teams of the past .
their coach bert van marwijk spent two-and-a-half years at bundesliga club borussia dortmund , and the embodiment of the new " tough dutch " style , defensive midfielder mark van bommel , is a barcelona veteran and current mainstay at bayern .
twenty years ago , it would have been unthinkable for the dutch and spanish to sacrifice the beautiful aspect of the beautiful game for results - or that germany would take spectators breaths away with technical acumen and inspiration .
but in the modern , internationalized game , anything is possible .
and that 's a key reason why the former perennial underachievers , spain , hoisted their first world cup trophy on sunday .

but to win the ever-elusive big one , the spaniards had to change their style . spain 's ugly 1-0 triumph over the netherlands in johannesburg on sunday was a match most neutral football fans will want to forget as soon as possible .
but the way the spanish claimed the title is truly memorable .
spain scored only eight goals in seven matches , winning each of their four knock-out stage games by a score of 1-0 and setting a new record for the fewest tallies ever by a winner .
to put the numbers in perspective : all previous teams that lifted the trophy scored at least 11 goals .
and in this tournament , third-placed germany found the back of the net twice as often as the spaniards .
indeed , the netherlands , argentina , brazil and even uruguay were more potent offensively than coach vicente del bosque 's men .
with so many of their games coming down to the wire , luck clearly played a role in spain 's first-ever world cup triumph .
but was it accidental ?
not at all .
squad with a flaw bildunterschrift : torres was unable to make a meaningful contribution spain rightly rolled into south africa as one of the pre-tournament favorites .
they were the reigning european champions , having scored 12 goals in 6 matches on their way to the 2008 title and being blessed with a starting midfield drawn exclusively from powerhouses barcelona and real madrid .
but the squad contained a potentially fatal flaw .
striker fernando torres , who was coming off knee surgery , proved to be a shadow of his normal self , rarely capable of getting behind defenses and unable to turn on the ball when he did .
that essentially left spain without an effective center forward , a crucial element in what had been the squad 's free-flowing attack .
the spanish survived the group stage , thanks largely to striker david villa 's individual brilliance , but at that point many people were writing them off .
there was no question that the midfield , anchored by the exceptional xavi and iniesta , would dominate possession and frustrate opponents with their short passing .
but how could spain win if there was no one big up front to serve as a target man ?
strategic adjustment bildunterschrift : villa came up huge the answer lay in a clever , if unorthodox tactical change .
del bosque went even smaller .
villa - whose official height is listed at 1.75 meters -lrb- 5 ' 9 " -rrb- - replaced torres in the middle , while the hole in the squad was filled by diminutive wingers pedro and jesus navas .

the trial was fiercely criticized by human rights activists .
art expert andrei yerofeyev and former museum director yury samodurov had set up the forbidden art exhibition at the andrei sakharov museum of moscow in 2007 , a museum devoted to the former soviet dissident and nobel peace prize winner who died in 1989 .
museum of moscow in 2007 .
the show included a depiction of jesus christ with a mickey mouse head and a spoof coca-cola ad carrying the slogan , " this is my blood . "
the exhibition was condemned by the russian orthodox church .
an ultra-nationalist orthodox group filed a complaint , and prosecutors opened an investigation into the show .
the two men were subsequently charged with inciting religious hatred .
yerofeyev protested that the show was not deliberately anti-christian , but that it was simply a protest about cultural censorship .
" i thought that this would cause controversy with the ministry of culture and other institutions , " he told news agency afp ahead of the ruling .
" but not within the church or with fascists .
" society is sick .
it still has problems with its reflection in the mirror , art , " he added .
the judge found the men guilty , saying they had " committed actions aimed at inciting hatred . "
yerofeyev and samodurov could have been sentenced to up to three years in prison , but were instead ordered to pay fines of up to 200,000 rubles -lrb- $ 6,500 -rrb- .former museum director yury samodurov said the guilty verdict was a return to soviet or tsarist times : " from now on any exhibition that shows religious symbols in a non-religious context , expressing a non-relgious meaning , is forbidden .
it means the use of religious symbols in art is being seen as a crime against faith " , samodurov told deutsche welle .
last week 13 russian artists published an open letter to president dmitry medvedev asking him to end the trial .
they said a guilty verdict would be a " sentence for the whole of russian contemporary art " and " another step towards the introduction of cultural censorship . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de latin america -pipe- 12.07.2010 colombia 's new president faces awkward questions over civilian murders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : santos was defense minister at the height of the civilian killings new colombian president juan manuel santos faces a difficult month before his inaugeration in august as the un human rights council is expected to hear allegations about his and his predecessor 's role in civilian deaths . victory for santos in colombia 's election runoff against rival antanas mockus , a former defense minister , may mean a new leader takes the reins but his presidency will mean an old scandal will continue to dog and haunt the country .
as santos prepares to take over from out-going president álvaro uribe on august 7 , his and his predecessor 's names are expected to feature in hearings at the un human rights council this month on allegations relating to their roles in the illegal killings of civilians .
while serving in the uribe administration as defense minister between 2006 and 2009 , santos was in charge of the military at a time when the colombian army 's alleged policy of murdering civilians in so-called " false positive " killings was at its height .
it is alleged that army units killed civilians to artificially increase the number of combat fatalities in battles against rebel group the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- .
santos was responsible for coordinating uribe 's mission to eradicate colombia of farc and restore security to one of the most violent countries in the world .
the military operation forced farc out of the cities into remote jungle areas , radically reduced the number of killings and kidnappings in urban areas and rescued colombia from becoming a failed state .
the success of uribe 's mission cemented his popularity and created his reputation among many as the man who saved colombia .
missing civilians linked to expanding war on farc bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colombian troops are accused of killing civilians as farc rebels however , human rights campaigners and international investigators were first alerted to a dark by-product of uribe 's campaign by accusations from families of missing men who claimed that the massive gains the colombian military were making against farc were being boosted by the " false positive " killings of innocent civilians .
the allegations and subsequent investigations led to the removal of the chief of the colombian military and 27 of his officers but santos was spared .
the colombian government has since taken further steps to prevent such killings but , according to un statistics , up to 98.5 percent remain unpunished .
santos continues to claim the killings were the acts of individual soldiers and units and were not sanctioned by the defense ministry .
un investigators remain unconvinced .
" there have been too many killings of a similar nature to characterize them as isolated incidents carried out by individual rogue soldiers or units , or ' bad apples ' , " philip alston , the un 's special rapporteur on extra-judicial killings wrote in a report presented to the un human rights council on june 3 .
" soldiers simply knew that they could get away with murder . "
poor people executed as rebels to boost casualty figures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all farc deaths were rebel victims one of the cases being investigated focuses on soacha , a poor suburb of the capital bogotá , and the town of ocaña some 600 kilometers -lrb- 372 miles -rrb- away .
in 2008 , it is alleged that dozens of young men were lured from soacha by paramilitaries and criminals promising employment in ocaña .
once there , they were allegedly sold to colombian army units which executed them as farc guerrillas .
their bodies were then supposedly clothed in military fatigues and draped with weapons and equipment .
the dead were then claimed to be rebel casualties in uribe 's fight against farc .
for the families , this made no sense .
how could the men of soacha , most unable to read or write , others with mental disabilities , transform themselves into uniformed , armed guerrillas ready to take on the battle-hardened colombian military , just days after leaving home ?
" the doctor and the judge said that my son was killed in combat at 2.45am on march 5 , " one mother told deutsche welle .
" his corpse was clothed in camouflage and boots - completely different clothes from what he was wearing when he left . " " the investigations must examine everything , because this can not continue like this , " another anonymous mother from soacha told deutsche welle .
" we will not rest .
this must not go unpunished , although i know that colombia is the land of impunity . " this is just one of the approximately 1,300 cases being examined by investigators from the public prosecutor 's office which suspect military personnel of murdering civilians and claiming they were guerrillas killed in combat in order to win bonuses of up to € 1,500 -lrb- $ 1,890 -rrb- per victim .
human rights campaigners suggest that over 2,000 young men were killed and buried in common graves as part of this policy . it is alleged that the kill bonus for units reporting higher enemy body counts , introduced by uribe 's administration in 2005 as part of its intensifying offensive against farc , contributed to the practise of abducting civilians and executing them as rebels .
the large increase of civilian disappearances in colombia can be traced back to this time . former leader claims the ends justified the means in the past , uribe has defended his government 's use of all necessary force to combat farc , saying that the country is safer than ever now due to his crackdown .
his opponents reject his argument that the ends justify the means . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uribe said that the force used to rout farc was justified " the reasoning of the government is completely worn out in my opinion and santos must find alternatives , " camilo gonzalez pozo , director of the colombian institute for the study of development and peace , told deutsche welle .
" the war against farc was the basis for all uribe 's government decisions .
if there was unemployment , farc was to blame for it .
if there were ' false positives ' then farc was to blame for it .
if there were paramilitaries , then farc was to blame for it .
all these arguments have worn themselves out . " with santos unlikely to swerve from uribe 's course of hunting and destroying farc rebels in the jungles of colombia once he becomes president , the memories of what happened in the early years of the operation are unlikely to dissipate .
the anticipated investigations and hearings during this month 's un human rights council session will also keep the topic in the public domain . author : nick amies / gottfried stein editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
