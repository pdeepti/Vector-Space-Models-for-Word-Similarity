deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . nikolaus is coming he may look similar to santa claus , but he is not quite the same thing .
in germany , saint nicholas - known as nikolaus - also has a white beard and carries a sack full of presents on his back , but he visits children in the wee hours of december 6 .
this date is not incidental , as december 6 is when people called nikolaus celebrate their name day in germany , in honor of the saint 's birthday . the story behind the event goes back to the third and fourth century ad .
saint nicholas - originally known as nikolaos of myra - was a greek bishop .
he had a reputation for gift-giving , which is why he also became the model for santa claus .
he is also known as the patron saint of children . in germany , kids eagerly await nikolaus each year .
they traditionally put a boot outside the front door on the evening of december 5 , expecting saint nicholas to fill it with gifts and sweets while they sleep .
this crucial part is usually performed by the parents , of course , but they like to make their children believe that saint nicholas rewards those who have been good and polite throughout the year . on the other hand , the german equivalent of santa claus - called weihnachtsmann -lrb- christmas man -rrb- - comes on christmas eve , along with the christkind -lrb- christ child -rrb- who is also a traditional gift-bringer in germany and other parts of central europe .
the figure of the christkind goes back to the times of martin luther , who , in line with his protestant teachings , discouraged the worship of saints , including saint nicholas . bildunterschrift : both nikolaus and santa claus were based on the same early christian saint results of the latest education study how good is the german education system ?
when the first pisa -lrb- programme for international student assessment -rrb- study came out in 2001 - a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school students ' scholastic performance - germany did not score particularly well .
the country 's media used terms like " pisa shock " to reflect the general disappointment . the study has been carried out every three years since then , with the latest results , due to be released on december 7 , focusing on reading abilities .
however , there is some controversy about how accurately the study really reflects the quality of an education system .
some critics point out that a student 's performance is influenced by many factors , and so it can not be explained by the quality of the school system alone . nevertheless , since the study came into existence , many are looking toward finland for guidance , as this northern european nation regularly scores excellent marks in pisa .
some believe that the german school system may be at fault after all .
the german tradition of dividing students into different types of high schools based on their academic performance has already been disputed and debated for quite some time .
and the pisa study only helps to fan the flames of this debate . big names on the big screen a much talked-about new movie by florian henckel von donnersmarck , " the tourist , " debuts in german movie theaters on december 16 .
the director won the academy award for best foreign language film in 2007 for his east-germany-based drama " the lives of others . " the film , which features hollywood stars angelina jolie and johnny depp in the main roles , is a thriller set in venice about an american tourist -lrb- depp -rrb- who is used by an english woman -lrb- jolie -rrb- in an attempt to mislead those following her criminal ex-lover . bildunterschrift : angelina jolie und johnny depp star in " the tourist " napoleon exhibition talking about your country 's history is not always easy - the germans know this all too well .
in the case of france , this problem relates to its former ruler and military leader napoleon bonaparte .
many french people are not proud of his imperialistic conquests and demonstrations of power , so it is not easy to organize an exhibition on the topic in his homeland , according to the spokesperson for the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany in bonn . from december 17 , the art and exhibition hall will host the exhibition " napoleon and europe .
dream and trauma , " which aims to explain who napoleon really was and how he rose to power .
items on display include original documents , paintings and everyday objects .
the exhibition 's curator is french scholar benedicte savoy , who teaches art history at the berlin institute of technology .
the exhibition will travel to france in march next year .
bildunterschrift : the exhibition features paintings depicting the life of napoleon , including battle scenes merry christmas and happy new year in germany , advent marks the countdown to christmas , which celebrates the birth of jesus christ .
during this time , an advent wreath decorates the tables in many german households .
this tradition can be traced back to johann hinrich wichern , a 19th-century german protestant pastor , who invented the wreath to make the advent time seem shorter for children , since they could light one candle in it each day . some theaters in germany offer a special advent program , where on each of the days between december 1 and december 24 -lrb- christmas eve -rrb- a little " door " is opened to reveal entertaining acts such as story-reading , dancing and music . and once christmas is over , it is soon time for new year 's eve .
as is customary on this special night , a large fireworks show will take place at the brandenburg gate in berlin to ring in 2011 when the clock strikes midnight . bildunterschrift : advent calendars were invented to contain children 's excitement ahead of christmas author : petra lambeck -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? # morewwwlinkstext # napoleon exhibition at bonn 's art and exhibition hall 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 25.11.2010 france plans to introduce new ' google tax ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris thinks google could contribute more to french coffers the french senate has approved a new tax on online advertising services offered by internet giants such as google .
but critics say the plan misses the point and burdens domestic companies instead . as online advertising continues to grow rapidly throughout europe , french senators this week approved a new tax law aimed at securing the government to a piece of the revenue pie .
although the measure is popularly known as the " google tax " , it does not directly impact the internet giant , which has based its advertising business offshore and out of reach of french tax collectors .
instead , the one-percent charge will be levied on all french-based companies purchasing online publicity services .
the measure is expected to become law in 2011 and generate between 10 and 20 million euros per year if it is passed by the national assembly , as predicted .
supporters of the tax say it will put online advertising on an equality footing with other media .
broadcast and print advertisements are already subject to taxation in france .
television advertising alone pumps roughly 70 million euros into government coffers annually .
but critics say the government 's plan fails to meet its original goal : to tax the french operations of internet giants such as google , microsoft , ebay and amazon , which are located strategically in european countries with low corporate tax rates , such as ireland and luxembourg .
french business leaders fear the measure will burden small advertisers and lead to an exodus of larger internet stakeholders from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original goal of the levy was to tax offshore internet giants ' profits according to iab europe – an umbrella organization representing national trade associations for digital and interactive marketing – france 's online advertising market is europe 's third largest after the united kingdom and germany .
in 2009 , the uk market was worth 4 billion euros , the german market worth 3 billion , and the french market worth 1.7 billion .
kimon zorbas , vice president of iab europe , says the proposed law is shortsighted in that it hits french companies while giving their foreign competitors a break .
" our position is that this is a market which is already less than half the size of the english market .
france has a lot of catching up to do , and such a tax on a developing market is doubly negative , " he told deutsche welle .
" any tax is bound to have an effect on the market .
naturally the question now is how big of an effect , and that 's something we ca n't yet know . "
pattern of intervention recently , a distinctly french approach to the economic and cultural challenges presented by the internet has emerged .
in october the country announced a subsidy system under which young people can buy partially subsidized cards to purchase and download music with .
the program is intended to encourage the legal downloading of music over internet piracy .
it has also begun to send piracy warnings via email to illegal file sharers .
and in november france extended its 1981 lang law – which lets publishers set book prices and forbids booksellers from giving more than a 5 percent discount – to apply to e-books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy 's government has been grappling with internet issues karin von abrams , a london-based analyst for emarketer , tracks the french market and says that while governments are generally " very wary of hindering " the growth of online markets , it 's not surprising that france would seek to tax them .
" france has a history of very deliberate federal supervision of – and sometimes intervention in – the media , " she told deutsche welle .
" they also have a very strong history of federal subsidies for culture … they see inequalities developing , and are perhaps more likely to intervene because of their historical attitudes in this respect . "
zorbas added that specialized national taxes could create disunity among european nations trying to increase their combined market share , and that attempts to create boundaries in the internet " just ca n't work out . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 25.11.2010 schalke 's confidence soars in europe while bremen plumbs new depths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could raul and schalke be about to take flight in europe ?
schalke 04 joined bayern munich in the last 16 of the champions league after a confident 3-0 win over lyon which hinted at a long-awaited return to form .
meanwhile , werder bremen continue to plumb the depths of despair . a team which had been struggling with a new faces and new tactics suddenly finds its feet in november , begins climbing the rungs in the bundesliga and marches in to the knockout stage of the champions league .
sound familiar ?
the story of bayern munich 's rise last season began , in some ways , like the unfolding tale of schalke 04 's campaign this time around .
bayern may never have flirted with the drop zone , but they began the season far off the pace .
right around the time christmas markets began opening up across the land , however , they found their rhythm - and built up the head of steam which carried them to their very successful end .
it remains fanciful to believe that schalke ’ s recent rampant form will be the start of a rise from the bottom to the top , resulting in schalke snatching the title in may , but it certainly appears - like bayern before them - that november is the month in which this schalke team began to click .
europe becomes schalke 's playground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huntelaar -lrb- m . -rrb- scored twice in schalke 's win over lyon schalke , in contrast to their wretched league from , have played well in europe nearly from the outset .
after a blip in their first group game at lyon , they have since won three and drawn one , a run of results which has seen them qualify for the knock-out rounds with a game to spare .
they could even go through as group winners .
wednesday night 's performance at home to lyon was the strongest indicator yet that schalke have turned a corner .
the team 's movement and one-touch passing was of such quality that it was hard to believe they were the same group that had sunk so desperately low in the bundesliga .
this was a truly european performance , with jefferson farfan and jose manuel jurado showing ingenuity and pace enough to rip the french defense to shreds .
raul , meanwhile , showed a growing belief in his new team , and klaas jan huntelaar 's rediscovered scoring touch can only bode well for the coming weeks .
schalke looked like they knew exactly what to do , and precisely what coach felix magath wanted from them .
even the royal blues ' defense , which has been shaky at best for most of the season , gave a commanding performance ; the much-maligned christoph metzelder and benedikt hoewedes in particular gave towering displays to cut out the threat from lyon 's ordinarily potent offense led by yoann gourcuff and lisandro lopez .
magath will now have confidence that his jigsaw is finally settling in place and that schalke can continue their climb out of the lower reaches of the bundesliga while progressing with flair in europe .
bremen in crisis as confidence goes awol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down and out : bremen 's loss to spurs ended their hopes werder bremen coach thomas schaaf has it worse - much worse .
taken apart by schalke last weekend in the league and dumped out of europe by tottenham hotspur on wednesday night , the north german club look destined to spend the remaining months of the season engaged in a fight for belief , if not survival , while felix magath 's side rub shoulders with the likes of barcelona , real madrid and manchester united .
bremen look such a broken team that it 's hard to see where any kind of recovery will come from .
the team werder sent out at white hart lane on wednesday was a mix of shell-shocked veterans and overwhelmed reserves who were getting a game only because of the team ’ s injury woes .
tottenham were 2-0 up at half time , but the way the beleaguered bremen squad left the pitch at the interval , they may as well have stayed in the locker room and taken the forfeit .
-lrb- the game did end 3-0 , as it happened . -rrb-
in the end , it did n't matter what the deficit was - werder were eliminated from the champions league .
moreover , they would need to beat european champions inter milan in their final group game , and make up a seven goal difference on fc twente to even have a chance of a place in the europa league place .
in other words , it ’ s not happening .
bremen have a north german derby on sunday against fc st. pauli which would usually be billed as a david and goliath clash .
on recent form though , it 's hard to say which is the skinny boy with the sling .
bremen 's response to dropping out of european competition for another season at home to pauli this weekend may determine their season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.11.2010 specter of ' ghost estates ' haunt post-property boom ireland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's easy to find housing estates like spencer dock in ireland the building boom , when economic times were good in ireland , has led to a huge oversupply of homes across the country .
so-called " ghost estates " now blight the republic , with many homes left unoccupied or unfinished . ask a taxi driver in dublin to take you to a " ghost estate , " and a kind one will point out that you can walk there and do n't actually need a cab .
there are several examples of unfinished or largely unoccupied housing developments in the irish capital , one of which is called spencer dock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while there may be lots of housing , there are few real homes spencer dock 's developers say the project will be completed and residency rates will rise , but it is currently far emptier than they would like , and stationary cranes dot the landscape with unfinished buildings breaking the skyline . apart from the main road a street away , there is little activity - the sound of children playing outside is rarely heard , for example , according to those people who have taken up residence .
there is also a shiny new tram line , but very few people waiting to use it .
it is hard to find irish residents living in this development off the banks of the river liffey and just outside the center of dublin .
mikaela ekman moved here from sweden .
she acknowledged the strange atmosphere in the largely empty neighborhood .
" yeah , it 's very half finished ! " she said , laughing and pointing to the cranes around nearby buildings .
spencer dock 's developers have even had to launch legal action against customers who agreed to buy property on the site but have changed their mind in view of plummeting home values and low residency .
a problem not confined to dublin there are far too many buildings for people in ireland , according to brendan williams , a lecturer in urban development at university college dublin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williams says housing supply vastly outstrips demand " we estimate that the overproduction or oversupply in the housing area is approximately 17 percent ; in other areas , such as commercial and offices , it 's of the order of 20 percent , " he said .
" there is also an oversupply in other sectors as well , such as hotels . "
williams says construction continued at a rapid pace in the irish republic long after signs appeared that the economy was cooling , with disastrous effects for irish banks that invested heavily in the housing boom .
" in a general sense , there was an oversupply and an overbuilding that continued largely through the period 2004-2009 , which contributed , obviously , to the eventual failure of the property market . "
nearly 100,000 homes were built in 2006 alone .
williams said house prices have crashed by as much as 50 percent from their peak .
that has wiped billions of euros off the balance sheets of the banks .
what now for ghost estates ?
it 's not clear exactly how many homes are unoccupied across ireland .
some estimates put the figure as high as 300,000 .
what is clear is that for the few residents who live in the ghost estates , life can be miserable .
some have such low occupancy rates that shopkeepers have declined to open in the area ; on some one side of the road is finished , while the other is not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steven lewis is very aware of the problems of living on a ghost estate steven lewis is one of those who has chosen to live on what he himself describes as a ghost estate just outside dublin .
he has done so because rent is cheap , but admits there is a downside .
" i 've had my car broken into three times this year , " he said , acknowledging the problems with crime on estates where little pride is felt by residents for their unfinished surroundings .
steven sympathizes with those people who actually bought property where he lives .
" my heart goes out to working class families that have bought a home , and they open up their windows and they see a half-finished house across the road from them , " he said .
" they 're now developing sewerage problems and all sorts of other health issues .
my heart seriously goes out to these people because they ca n't move on now . "
a need to face up to reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are new tram connections , but few passengers to use them the solution to these problems is one that may be unpalatable to banks , developers and property owners alike .
williams says that people need to acknowledge the realities of vast oversupply and start selling unoccupied properties in ghost estates at vastly knocked-down prices .
but there 's another looming problem that could make such steps immaterial : with tens of thousands of people expected to leave ireland in the coming years because of its economic problems , excess supply in the housing market may yet worsen further .

this discovery could be used to develop better microchips for computers or more efficient solar energy technology , according to their research which was published in the journal nature on thursday .
bose-einstein condensates -lrb- bec -rrb- were first proposed in the 1920s by satyendra nath bose and albert einstein , who asserted that atoms , chilled to very near absolute zero , would take on quantum characteristics , so that the atoms " overlap , and behave as a giant meta-wave , " or a sort of super-atom , wherein a collection of atoms all act in concert , weitz told deutsche welle .
not everyone in the field of quantum optics is happy with the term super-atom or super-photon though , such as aephraim steinberg , a quantum physicist at the university of toronto .
" i find the word a little confusing and misleading , so i wouldn ’ t really want to call this a super photon , " steinberg said . within the bec there is still a collection of weakly interacting particles ; they don ’ t merge together to create a new molecule or new solid , but they take on an additional property that they all want to behave the same way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin weitz and his team worked on the experiment for three years " so it 's no more a super-atom than an army is a super person ; there may be ten thousand people marching in the same direction , but they 're not some sort of new creature , " steinberg said . the bec state was previously believed to apply only to atoms and not to photons , since the cooling process would force the photons to be absorbed by surrounding atoms in the apparatus . " if you cool down light , normally the light goes away , " weitz explained .
" if you turn off a light bulb then the filament cools down and it changes its color from yellow to red , as the number of photons is reduced , becoming dimmer and dimmer until they disappear entirely . " photons acting like atoms but now weitz , along with jan klaers , julian schmitt and frank vewinger , has managed to create a photonic bec at room temperature by trapping photons between two concave mirrors . the experiment also made use of liquid dye pigment that cooled the photons down to room temperature while they were trapped between the two mirrors .
when enough photons were pumped into this apparatus , a bec state was observed " which appeared as a yellow peak in the middle and there the photons marched in step , " weitz said . the discovery took three years of research and is being hailed as a major breakthrough in the field of quantum physics . matthias weidemueller , a quantum physicist at the university of freiburg , said in the journal nature that the experiment was " truly ingenious . " " compared to bose-einstein condensation with ultracold atoms , the current experiment is ridiculously simple , " he said . but some in the field maintain that , while the results are welcome and that the concept of a bec of photons was controversial , it 's not completely unexpected .
aephraim steinberg , a quantum physicist at the university of toronto , says quantum mechanics basically dictate that all bosons , a category which includes rubidium-87 atoms used in atomic bec , as well as photons , want to act in the same way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one potential application would be the creation of shortwave lasers " i think there 's been a lot of confusion and i think -lrb- this experiment -rrb- helps clarify some fundamental physics to see that , at a deep level , all particles are really the same , whether it ’ s a boson of light or a boson of rubidium , they really do have the same properties if you put them in the right circumstances , " steinberg said in a telephone interview . putting it to work weitz has a couple of ideas for applications resulting from the research at the university of bonn .
creating shortwave lasers in the x-ray or ultra-violet spectrum is one such idea . such shortwave lasers would be well-suited to the manufacture of computer chips as the process uses lasers to etch logic circuits onto semiconductor materials .
the precision of shortwave lasers is superior to those with longer wavelengths , which would allow chip designers to create more complex circuitry on the same area of silcon . another possible application using this apparatus , but with less light , weitz said , would be to concentrate the light for solar cells .
by placing the apparatus before a solar cell , " you could save a lot of money because you could use smaller solar cells but nevertheless , get all the light , " weitz said . weitz and his colleagues will now be focusing on learning more about the photonic bec they 've created , and also attempting to simplify the apparatus by switching out the liquid dye currently used , for a solid-state dye , which would require less equipment to manage . author : stuart tiffen editor : nicole goebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so-called " ghost estates " now blight the republic , with many homes left unoccupied or unfinished . ask a taxi driver in dublin to take you to a " ghost estate , " and a kind one will point out that you can walk there and do n't actually need a cab .
there are several examples of unfinished or largely unoccupied housing developments in the irish capital , one of which is called spencer dock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while there may be lots of housing , there are few real homes spencer dock 's developers say the project will be completed and residency rates will rise , but it is currently far emptier than they would like , and stationary cranes dot the landscape with unfinished buildings breaking the skyline . apart from the main road a street away , there is little activity - the sound of children playing outside is rarely heard , for example , according to those people who have taken up residence .
there is also a shiny new tram line , but very few people waiting to use it .
it is hard to find irish residents living in this development off the banks of the river liffey and just outside the center of dublin .
mikaela ekman moved here from sweden .
she acknowledged the strange atmosphere in the largely empty neighborhood .
" yeah , it 's very half finished ! " she said , laughing and pointing to the cranes around nearby buildings .
spencer dock 's developers have even had to launch legal action against customers who agreed to buy property on the site but have changed their mind in view of plummeting home values and low residency .
a problem not confined to dublin there are far too many buildings for people in ireland , according to brendan williams , a lecturer in urban development at university college dublin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williams says housing supply vastly outstrips demand " we estimate that the overproduction or oversupply in the housing area is approximately 17 percent ; in other areas , such as commercial and offices , it 's of the order of 20 percent , " he said .
" there is also an oversupply in other sectors as well , such as hotels . "
williams says construction continued at a rapid pace in the irish republic long after signs appeared that the economy was cooling , with disastrous effects for irish banks that invested heavily in the housing boom .
" in a general sense , there was an oversupply and an overbuilding that continued largely through the period 2004-2009 , which contributed , obviously , to the eventual failure of the property market . "
nearly 100,000 homes were built in 2006 alone .
williams said house prices have crashed by as much as 50 percent from their peak .
that has wiped billions of euros off the balance sheets of the banks .
what now for ghost estates ?
it 's not clear exactly how many homes are unoccupied across ireland .
some estimates put the figure as high as 300,000 .
what is clear is that for the few residents who live in the ghost estates , life can be miserable .
some have such low occupancy rates that shopkeepers have declined to open in the area ; on some one side of the road is finished , while the other is not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steven lewis is very aware of the problems of living on a ghost estate steven lewis is one of those who has chosen to live on what he himself describes as a ghost estate just outside dublin .
he has done so because rent is cheap , but admits there is a downside .
" i 've had my car broken into three times this year , " he said , acknowledging the problems with crime on estates where little pride is felt by residents for their unfinished surroundings .
steven sympathizes with those people who actually bought property where he lives .
" my heart goes out to working class families that have bought a home , and they open up their windows and they see a half-finished house across the road from them , " he said .
" they 're now developing sewerage problems and all sorts of other health issues .
my heart seriously goes out to these people because they ca n't move on now . "
a need to face up to reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are new tram connections , but few passengers to use them the solution to these problems is one that may be unpalatable to banks , developers and property owners alike .
williams says that people need to acknowledge the realities of vast oversupply and start selling unoccupied properties in ghost estates at vastly knocked-down prices .
but there 's another looming problem that could make such steps immaterial : with tens of thousands of people expected to leave ireland in the coming years because of its economic problems , excess supply in the housing market may yet worsen further .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . nikolaus is coming he may look similar to santa claus , but he is not quite the same thing .
in germany , saint nicholas - known as nikolaus - also has a white beard and carries a sack full of presents on his back , but he visits children in the wee hours of december 6 .
this date is not incidental , as december 6 is when people called nikolaus celebrate their name day in germany , in honor of the saint 's birthday . the story behind the event goes back to the third and fourth century ad .
saint nicholas - originally known as nikolaos of myra - was a greek bishop .
he had a reputation for gift-giving , which is why he also became the model for santa claus .
he is also known as the patron saint of children . in germany , kids eagerly await nikolaus each year .
they traditionally put a boot outside the front door on the evening of december 5 , expecting saint nicholas to fill it with gifts and sweets while they sleep .
this crucial part is usually performed by the parents , of course , but they like to make their children believe that saint nicholas rewards those who have been good and polite throughout the year . on the other hand , the german equivalent of santa claus - called weihnachtsmann -lrb- christmas man -rrb- - comes on christmas eve , along with the christkind -lrb- christ child -rrb- who is also a traditional gift-bringer in germany and other parts of central europe .
the figure of the christkind goes back to the times of martin luther , who , in line with his protestant teachings , discouraged the worship of saints , including saint nicholas . bildunterschrift : both nikolaus and santa claus were based on the same early christian saint results of the latest education study how good is the german education system ?
when the first pisa -lrb- programme for international student assessment -rrb- study came out in 2001 - a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school students ' scholastic performance - germany did not score particularly well .
the country 's media used terms like " pisa shock " to reflect the general disappointment . the study has been carried out every three years since then , with the latest results , due to be released on december 7 , focusing on reading abilities .
however , there is some controversy about how accurately the study really reflects the quality of an education system .
some critics point out that a student 's performance is influenced by many factors , and so it can not be explained by the quality of the school system alone . nevertheless , since the study came into existence , many are looking toward finland for guidance , as this northern european nation regularly scores excellent marks in pisa .
some believe that the german school system may be at fault after all .
the german tradition of dividing students into different types of high schools based on their academic performance has already been disputed and debated for quite some time .
and the pisa study only helps to fan the flames of this debate . big names on the big screen a much talked-about new movie by florian henckel von donnersmarck , " the tourist , " debuts in german movie theaters on december 16 .
the director won the academy award for best foreign language film in 2007 for his east-germany-based drama " the lives of others . " the film , which features hollywood stars angelina jolie and johnny depp in the main roles , is a thriller set in venice about an american tourist -lrb- depp -rrb- who is used by an english woman -lrb- jolie -rrb- in an attempt to mislead those following her criminal ex-lover . bildunterschrift : angelina jolie und johnny depp star in " the tourist " napoleon exhibition talking about your country 's history is not always easy - the germans know this all too well .
in the case of france , this problem relates to its former ruler and military leader napoleon bonaparte .
many french people are not proud of his imperialistic conquests and demonstrations of power , so it is not easy to organize an exhibition on the topic in his homeland , according to the spokesperson for the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany in bonn . from december 17 , the art and exhibition hall will host the exhibition " napoleon and europe .
dream and trauma , " which aims to explain who napoleon really was and how he rose to power .
items on display include original documents , paintings and everyday objects .
the exhibition 's curator is french scholar benedicte savoy , who teaches art history at the berlin institute of technology .
the exhibition will travel to france in march next year .
bildunterschrift : the exhibition features paintings depicting the life of napoleon , including battle scenes merry christmas and happy new year in germany , advent marks the countdown to christmas , which celebrates the birth of jesus christ .
during this time , an advent wreath decorates the tables in many german households .
this tradition can be traced back to johann hinrich wichern , a 19th-century german protestant pastor , who invented the wreath to make the advent time seem shorter for children , since they could light one candle in it each day . some theaters in germany offer a special advent program , where on each of the days between december 1 and december 24 -lrb- christmas eve -rrb- a little " door " is opened to reveal entertaining acts such as story-reading , dancing and music . and once christmas is over , it is soon time for new year 's eve .
as is customary on this special night , a large fireworks show will take place at the brandenburg gate in berlin to ring in 2011 when the clock strikes midnight . bildunterschrift : advent calendars were invented to contain children 's excitement ahead of christmas author : petra lambeck -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? # morewwwlinkstext # napoleon exhibition at bonn 's art and exhibition hall feedback do you celebrate a special tradition in december ?

this discovery could be used to develop better microchips for computers or more efficient solar energy technology , according to their research which was published in the journal nature on thursday .
bose-einstein condensates -lrb- bec -rrb- were first proposed in the 1920s by satyendra nath bose and albert einstein , who asserted that atoms , chilled to very near absolute zero , would take on quantum characteristics , so that the atoms " overlap , and behave as a giant meta-wave , " or a sort of super-atom , wherein a collection of atoms all act in concert , weitz told deutsche welle .

but the opposition thinks not everyone is benefitting from the boom . just in time for the christmas , it seems german consumers are rediscovering the joys of shopping .
speaking to the lower house of the german parliament on thursday , economics minister rainer bruederle said domestic demand was on the upswing and stronger than expected , as consumers were once again feeling comfortable enough to go out and spend .
" we 're consuming again , people are doing well and people are spending again , " said bruederle , calling the economic upswing like something " out of a fairy tale . "
germany 's gross domestic product is expected to grow by about 3.5 percent this year , nearing a two-decade high , and by 2.6 percent in 2011 .
bruederle said under the governing center-right coalition of the christian democrats and the liberal free democrats , germany has become the economic model for all of europe , adding that the country could expect to enjoy its current economic growth for the foreseeable future .
the market research firm gfk said consumer morale rose more than expected in november , for the sixth month in a row .
and german business sentiment rose to its strongest level since 1991 in november , according to the ifo economic think tank .
in october , unemployment fell to an 18-year low , dropping below three million for the first time since november 2008 .
bruederle is convinced that full employment could soon be a possibility , adding that in many regions in the south of the country this was already a reality .
opposition calls for wage increases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said germany had become the economic model for all of europe however , the opposition greens , social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and left party criticized bruederle 's comments , saying the economic boom was leaving the unemployed , retired and poor behind .
garrelt duin , of the spd , said the economic upswing was not stable or balanced .
he said both domestic investment and wages needed to increase , to support the increased domestic demand .
michael schlecht of the left party pointed out that while businesses were enjoying a growth in profits of up to 40 percent , wages had hardly followed suit .
he said that since 2000 , businesses had seen incomes increase by at least 50 percent , but the income of the average worker has actually dropped .
schlecht also said austerity programs in other european union countries , such as greece and ireland , would have a negative trickledown effect on german exports , on which germany has traditionally relied to support its growth .
he called for a reversal of the reforms to the “ hartz iv ” welfare subsidy program and for the introduction of a set minimum wage of 10 euros -lrb- $ 13.4 -rrb- per hour , to shore up the domestic growth sector .

this discovery could be used to develop better microchips for computers or more efficient solar energy technology , according to their research which was published in the journal nature on thursday .
bose-einstein condensates -lrb- bec -rrb- were first proposed in the 1920s by satyendra nath bose and albert einstein , who asserted that atoms , chilled to very near absolute zero , would take on quantum characteristics , so that the atoms " overlap , and behave as a giant meta-wave , " or a sort of super-atom , wherein a collection of atoms all act in concert , weitz told deutsche welle .
not everyone in the field of quantum optics is happy with the term super-atom or super-photon though , such as aephraim steinberg , a quantum physicist at the university of toronto .
" i find the word a little confusing and misleading , so i wouldn ’ t really want to call this a super photon , " steinberg said . within the bec there is still a collection of weakly interacting particles ; they don ’ t merge together to create a new molecule or new solid , but they take on an additional property that they all want to behave the same way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin weitz and his team worked on the experiment for three years " so it 's no more a super-atom than an army is a super person ; there may be ten thousand people marching in the same direction , but they 're not some sort of new creature , " steinberg said . the bec state was previously believed to apply only to atoms and not to photons , since the cooling process would force the photons to be absorbed by surrounding atoms in the apparatus . " if you cool down light , normally the light goes away , " weitz explained .
" if you turn off a light bulb then the filament cools down and it changes its color from yellow to red , as the number of photons is reduced , becoming dimmer and dimmer until they disappear entirely . " photons acting like atoms but now weitz , along with jan klaers , julian schmitt and frank vewinger , has managed to create a photonic bec at room temperature by trapping photons between two concave mirrors . the experiment also made use of liquid dye pigment that cooled the photons down to room temperature while they were trapped between the two mirrors .
when enough photons were pumped into this apparatus , a bec state was observed " which appeared as a yellow peak in the middle and there the photons marched in step , " weitz said . the discovery took three years of research and is being hailed as a major breakthrough in the field of quantum physics . matthias weidemueller , a quantum physicist at the university of freiburg , said in the journal nature that the experiment was " truly ingenious . " " compared to bose-einstein condensation with ultracold atoms , the current experiment is ridiculously simple , " he said . but some in the field maintain that , while the results are welcome and that the concept of a bec of photons was controversial , it 's not completely unexpected .
aephraim steinberg , a quantum physicist at the university of toronto , says quantum mechanics basically dictate that all bosons , a category which includes rubidium-87 atoms used in atomic bec , as well as photons , want to act in the same way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one potential application would be the creation of shortwave lasers " i think there 's been a lot of confusion and i think -lrb- this experiment -rrb- helps clarify some fundamental physics to see that , at a deep level , all particles are really the same , whether it ’ s a boson of light or a boson of rubidium , they really do have the same properties if you put them in the same circumstances , " steinberg said in a telephone interview . putting it to work weitz has a couple of ideas for applications resulting from the research at the university of bonn .
creating shortwave lasers in the x-ray or ultra-violet spectrum is one such idea . such shortwave lasers would be well-suited to the manufacture of computer chips as the process uses lasers to etch logic circuits onto semiconductor materials .
the precision of shortwave lasers is superior to those with longer wavelengths , which would allow chip designers to create more complex circuitry on the same area of silcon . another possible application using this apparatus , but with less light , weitz said , would be to concentrate the light for solar cells .
by placing the apparatus before a solar cell , " you could save a lot of money because you could use smaller solar cells but nevertheless , get all the light , " weitz said . weitz and his colleagues will now be focusing on learning more about the photonic bec they 've created , and also attempting to simplify the apparatus by switching out the liquid dye currently used , for a solid-state dye , which would require less equipment to manage . author : stuart tiffen editor : nicole goebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 25.11.2010 december 2010 : dw 's culture calendar from music and art to film and dance - find out what 's going on in germany 's cultural scene .
deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . nikolaus is coming he may look similar to santa claus , but he is not quite the same thing .
in germany , saint nicholas - known as nikolaus - also has a white beard and carries a sack full of presents on his back , but he visits children in the wee hours of december 6 .
this date is not incidental , as december 6 is when people called nikolaus celebrate their name day in germany , in honor of the saint 's birthday . the story behind the event goes back to the third and fourth century ad .
saint nicholas - originally known as nikolaos of myra - was a greek bishop .
he had a reputation for gift-giving , which is why he also became the model for santa claus .
he is also known as the patron saint of children . in germany , kids eagerly await nikolaus each year .
they traditionally put a boot outside the front door on the evening of december 5 , expecting saint nicholas to fill it with gifts and sweets while they sleep .
this crucial part is usually performed by the parents , of course , but they like to make their children believe that saint nicholas rewards those who have been good and polite throughout the year . on the other hand , the german equivalent of santa claus - called weihnachtsmann -lrb- christmas man -rrb- - comes on christmas eve , along with the christkind -lrb- christ child -rrb- who is also a traditional gift-bringer in germany and other parts of central europe .
the figure of the christkind goes back to the times of martin luther , who , in line with his protestant teachings , discouraged the worship of saints , including saint nicholas . bildunterschrift : both nikolaus and santa claus were based on the same early christian saint results of the latest education study how good is the german education system ?
when the first pisa -lrb- programme for international student assessment -rrb- study came out in 2001 - a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school students ' scholastic performance - germany did not score particularly well .
the country 's media used terms like " pisa shock " to reflect the general disappointment . the study has been carried out every three years since then , with the latest results , due to be released on december 7 , focusing on reading abilities .
however , there is some controversy about how accurately the study really reflects the quality of an education system .
some critics point out that a student 's performance is influenced by many factors , and so it can not be explained by the quality of the school system alone . nevertheless , since the study came into existence , many are looking toward finland for guidance , as this northern european nation regularly scores excellent marks in pisa .
some believe that the german school system may be at fault after all .
the german tradition of dividing students into different types of high schools based on their academic performance has already been disputed and debated for quite some time .
and the pisa study only helps to fan the flames of this debate . big names on the big screen a much talked-about new movie by florian henckel von donnersmarck , " the tourist , " debuts in german movie theaters on december 16 .
the director won the academy award for best foreign language film in 2007 for his east-germany-based drama " the lives of others . " the film , which features hollywood stars angelina jolie and johnny depp in the main roles , is a thriller set in venice about an american tourist -lrb- depp -rrb- who is used by an english woman -lrb- jolie -rrb- in an attempt to mislead those following her criminal ex-lover . bildunterschrift : angelina jolie und johnny depp star in " the tourist " napoleon exhibition talking about your country 's history is not always easy - the germans know this all too well .
in the case of france , this problem relates to its former ruler and military leader napoleon bonaparte .
many french people are not proud of his imperialistic conquests and demonstrations of power , so it is not easy to organize an exhibition on the topic in his homeland , according to the spokesperson for the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany in bonn . from december 17 , the art and exhibition hall will host the exhibition " napoleon and europe .
dream and trauma , " which aims to explain who napoleon really was and how he rose to power .
items on display include original documents , paintings and everyday objects .
the exhibition 's curator is french scholar benedicte savoy , who teaches art history at the berlin institute of technology .
the exhibition will travel to france in march next year .
bildunterschrift : the exhibition features paintings depicting the life of napoleon , including battle scenes merry christmas and happy new year in germany , advent marks the countdown to christmas , which celebrates the birth of jesus christ .
during this time , an advent wreath decorates the tables in many german households .
this tradition can be traced back to johann hinrich wichern , a 19th-century german protestant pastor , who invented the wreath to make the advent time seem shorter for children , since they could light one candle in it each day . some theaters in germany offer a special advent program , where on each of the days between december 1 and december 24 -lrb- christmas eve -rrb- a little " door " is opened to reveal entertaining acts such as story-reading , dancing and music . and once christmas is over , it is soon time for new year 's eve .
as is customary on this special night , a large fireworks show will take place at the brandenburg gate in berlin to ring in 2011 when the clock strikes midnight . bildunterschrift : advent calendars were invented to contain children 's excitement ahead of christmas author : petra lambeck -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? # morewwwlinkstext # napoleon exhibition at bonn 's art and exhibition hall feedback do you celebrate a special tradition in december ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 25.11.2010 schalke 's confidence soars in europe while bremen plumbs new depths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could raul and schalke be about to take flight in europe ?
schalke 04 joined bayern munich in the last 16 of the champions league after a confident 3-0 win over lyon which hinted at a long-awaited return to form .
meanwhile , werder bremen continue to plumb the depths of despair . a team which had been struggling with a new faces and new tactics suddenly finds its feet in november , begins climbing the rungs in the bundesliga and marches in to the knockout stage of the champions league .
sound familiar ?
the story of bayern munich 's rise last season began , in some ways , like the unfolding tale of schalke 04 's campaign this time around .
bayern may never have flirted with the drop zone , but they began the season far off the pace .
right around the time christmas markets began opening up across the land , however , they found their rhythm - and built up the head of steam which carried them to their very successful end .
it remains fanciful to believe that schalke ’ s recent rampant form will be the start of a rise from the bottom to the top , resulting in schalke snatching the title in may , but it certainly appears - like bayern before them - that november is the month in which this schalke team began to click .
europe becomes schalke 's playground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huntelaar -lrb- m . -rrb- scored twice in schalke 's win over lyon schalke , in contrast to their wretched league from , have played well in europe nearly from the outset .
after a blip in their first group game at lyon , they have since won three and drawn one , a run of results which has seen them qualify for the knock-out rounds with a game to spare .
they could even go through as group winners .
wednesday night 's performance at home to lyon was the strongest indicator yet that schalke have turned a corner .
the team 's movement and one-touch passing was of such quality that it was hard to believe they were the same group that had sunk so desperately low in the bundesliga .
this was a truly european performance , with jefferson farfan and jose manuel jurado showing ingenuity and pace enough to rip the french defense to shreds .
raul , meanwhile , showed a growing belief in his new team , and klaas jan huntelaar 's rediscovered scoring touch can only bode well for the coming weeks .
schalke looked like they knew exactly what to do , and precisely what coach felix magath wanted from them .
even the royal blues ' defense , which has been shaky at best for most of the season , gave a commanding performance ; the much-maligned christoph metzelder and benedikt hoewedes in particular gave towering displays to cut out the threat from lyon 's ordinarily potent offense led by yoann gourcuff and lisandro lopez .
magath will now have confidence that his jigsaw is finally settling in place and that schalke can continue their climb out of the lower reaches of the bundesliga while progressing with flair in europe .
bremen in crisis as confidence goes awol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down and out : bremen 's loss to spurs ended their hopes werder bremen coach thomas schaaf has it worse - much worse .
taken apart by schalke last weekend in the league and dumped out of europe by tottenham hotspur on wednesday night , the north german club look destined to spend the remaining months of the season engaged in a fight for belief , if not survival , while felix magath 's side rub shoulders with the likes of barcelona , real madrid and manchester united .
bremen look such a broken team that it 's hard to see where any kind of recovery will come from .
the team werder sent out at white hart lane on wednesday was a mix of shell-shocked veterans and overwhelmed reserves who were getting a game only because of the team ’ s injury woes .
tottenham were 2-0 up at half time , but the way the beleaguered bremen squad left the pitch at the interval , they may as well have stayed in the locker room and taken the forfeit .
-lrb- the game did end 3-0 , as it happened . -rrb-
in the end , it did n't matter what the deficit was - werder were eliminated from the champions league .
moreover , they would need to beat european champions inter milan in their final group game , and make up a seven goal difference on fc twente to even have a chance of a place in the europa league place .
in other words , it ’ s not happening .
bremen have a north german derby on sunday against fc st. pauli which would usually be billed as a david and goliath clash .
on recent form though , it 's hard to say which is the skinny boy with the sling .
bremen 's response to dropping out of european competition for another season at home to pauli this weekend may determine their season .

but the opposition thinks not everyone is benefitting from the boom . just in time for the christmas , it seems german consumers are rediscovering the joys of shopping .
speaking to the lower house of the german parliament on thursday , economics minister rainer bruederle said domestic demand was on the upswing and stronger than expected , as consumers were once again feeling comfortable enough to go out and spend .
" we 're consuming again , people are doing well and people are spending again , " said bruederle , calling the economic upswing like something " out of a fairy tale . "
germany 's gross domestic product is expected to grow by about 3.5 percent this year , nearing a two-decade high , and by 2.6 percent in 2011 .
bruederle said under the governing center-right coalition of the christian democrats and the liberal free democrats , germany has become the economic model for all of europe , adding that the country could expect to enjoy its current economic growth for the foreseeable future .
the market research firm gfk said consumer morale rose more than expected in november , for the sixth month in a row .
and german business sentiment rose to its strongest level since 1991 in november , according to the ifo economic think tank .
in october , unemployment fell to an 18-year low , dropping below three million for the first time since november 2008 .
bruederle is convinced that full employment could soon be a possibility , adding that in many regions in the south of the country this was already a reality .
opposition calls for wage increases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said germany had become the economic model for all of europe however , the opposition greens , social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and left party criticized bruederle 's comments , saying the economic boom was leaving the unemployed , retired and poor behind .
garrelt duin , of the spd , said the economic upswing was not stable or balanced .
he said both domestic investment and wages needed to increase , to support the increased domestic demand .
michael schlecht of the left party pointed out that while businesses were enjoying a growth in profits of up to 40 percent , wages had hardly followed suit .
he said that since 2000 , businesses had seen incomes increase by at least 50 percent , but the income of the average worker has actually dropped .
schlecht also said austerity programs in other european union countries , such as greece and ireland , would have a negative trickledown effect on german exports , on which germany has traditionally relied to support its growth .
he called for a reversal of the reforms to the “ hartz iv ” welfare subsidy program and for the introduction of a set minimum wage of 10 euros -lrb- $ 13.4 -rrb- per hour , to shore up the domestic growth sector .

now it barely glimmers in the history books .
however , author and journalist regine beyer , who has just published a new biography of stone entitled " abendkleid und filzstiefen " -lrb- " evening dress and felt boots " -rrb- , hopes her book will see a resurgence in popularity for this vibrant but overlooked singer .
" she was a very optimistic person and i mean optimism in this case as a source of life power , " said beyer , " she was very intelligent , she kept changing with the times , she connected a lot of different kinds of people and that is something that i aspire to as well . "
after more than a decade of weekly meetings gathering material for the book , beyer and stone became firm friends , although this developing affection between the two women did n't color the text which beyer ultimately published .
" i think as a journalist , i know how to keep the balance between journalism and a certain kind of empathy , " she pointed out , " i allowed her a lot of space to keep her spirit in the book . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone sisters : peggy stone -lrb- r -rrb- with best friend laelia rivlin life upset by war stone was born rosa goldstein in berlin in 1907 to german-jewish parents and shortly after her birth the family moved to bialystok in poland and from there to moscow where the young rosa studied piano .
after the 1917 revolution , mrs. goldstein fled russia with her three daughters and made her way back to berlin via bialystok , where the family was finally reunited with mr. goldstein in 1922 .
at the age of 12 , a love of singing and dance earned rosa the nickname peggy , partly due to her resemblance to the american child actress , peggy montgomery .
it was in weimar-era germany in the 1920s that peggy began her career as a performer .
she cut her teeth singing in cinemas , working as a chorus girl and appearing as a film extra .
her first flush of true success came in 1928 when , with her friend laelia rivilin , she founded the stone sisters .
two girls - each with a piano - performed a wild mix of jazz standards , ragtime , swing and popular german " schlager " music .
the duo 's career was guided by theater impressario kurt robitschek who secured bookings for the girls at important cabarets such as the tivoli , the trocadero and the moulin rouge .
the rise of nazism in germany forced peggy to flee the country in 1933 .
she settled in sweden and then russia where , with the czernowitzer jazz orchestra , she toured military bases and field hospitals entertaining russian servicemen .
at the end of world war ii , she was living in bucharest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author regine beyer spent 10 years interviewing peggy stone in new york new beginning in new york by the early 50s , peggy had re-located once again , this time to israel , but with few opportunities to perform available in the fledgling state , she packed her bags and moved for what would be the last time .
in 1953 , new york would become her permanent home but , by now in her late 40s , her career as a performer was over and she moved instead into the fashion industry working as a successful copyist .
it was here in the late 90s that author regine beyer met stone and began to record her life story , determined one day to turn it into a biography .
britta juergs from the aviva publishing house also fell for stone 's story and agreed to produce the book .
" maybe she 's not so famous , but she 's such an interesting woman , " she said , " in the book we have lots of original peggy .
there are parts of regine and there are parts of peggy stone and i think that 's really great to hear her because she had lots and lots of humor and it 's great to read . "
despite her contribution to the entertainment world and widespread popularity in her day , peggy stone has faded into relative obscurity ; partly because she was n't political or ground-breaking and also because she was active at a time when women had fewer opportunities than men to be recorded and preserved for posterity .
in 10 years of researching her subject , regine beyer was unable to unearth a single professional audio recording of peggy stone performing .
a natural optimist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyer 's new biography of stone now , the public has an opportunity to rediscover the world of peggy stone and her biographer and friend regine beyer wants them to remember her " as a woman who lived through very difficult times , who complained very little , who stood up to the reality , who tried to live her life the best she could and who also had a real great knack for putting people in touch from very different backgrounds . "
" she was a people 's person and she was always believing in life and that 's a great message , " added beyer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.11.2010 specter of ' ghost estates ' haunt post-property boom ireland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's easy to find housing estates like spencer dock in ireland the building boom , when economic times were good in ireland , has led to a huge oversupply of homes across the country .
so-called " ghost estates " now blight the republic , with many homes left unoccupied or unfinished . ask a taxi driver in dublin to take you to a " ghost estate , " and a kind one will point out that you can walk there and do n't actually need a cab .
there are several examples of unfinished or largely unoccupied housing developments in the irish capital , one of which is called spencer dock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while there may be lots of housing , there are few real homes spencer dock 's developers say the project will be completed and residency rates will rise , but it is currently far emptier than they would like , and stationary cranes dot the landscape with unfinished buildings breaking the skyline . apart from the main road a street away , there is little activity - the sound of children playing outside is rarely heard , for example , according to those people who have taken up residence .
there is also a shiny new tram line , but very few people waiting to use it .
it is hard to find irish residents living in this development off the banks of the river liffey and just outside the center of dublin .
mikaela ekman moved here from sweden .
she acknowledged the strange atmosphere in the largely empty neighborhood .
" yeah , it 's very half finished ! " she said , laughing and pointing to the cranes around nearby buildings .
spencer dock 's developers have even had to launch legal action against customers who agreed to buy property on the site but have changed their mind in view of plummeting home values and low residency .
a problem not confined to dublin there are far too many buildings for people in ireland , according to brendan williams , a lecturer in urban development at university college dublin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williams says housing supply vastly outstrips demand " we estimate that the overproduction or oversupply in the housing area is approximately 17 percent ; in other areas , such as commercial and offices , it 's of the order of 20 percent , " he said .
" there is also an oversupply in other sectors as well , such as hotels . "
williams says construction continued at a rapid pace in the irish republic long after signs appeared that the economy was cooling , with disastrous effects for irish banks that invested heavily in the housing boom .
" in a general sense , there was an oversupply and an overbuilding that continued largely through the period 2004-2009 , which contributed , obviously , to the eventual failure of the property market . "
nearly 100,000 homes were built in 2006 alone .
williams said house prices have crashed by as much as 50 percent from their peak .
that has wiped billions of euros off the balance sheets of the banks .
what now for ghost estates ?
it 's not clear exactly how many homes are unoccupied across ireland .
some estimates put the figure as high as 300,000 .
what is clear is that for the few residents who live in the ghost estates , life can be miserable .
some have such low occupancy rates that shopkeepers have declined to open in the area ; on some one side of the road is finished , while the other is not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steven lewis is very aware of the problems of living on a ghost estate steven lewis is one of those who has chosen to live on what he himself describes as a ghost estate just outside dublin .
he has done so because rent is cheap , but admits there is a downside .
" i 've had my car broken into three times this year , " he said , acknowledging the problems with crime on estates where little pride is felt by residents for their unfinished surroundings .
steven sympathizes with those people who actually bought property where he lives .
" my heart goes out to working class families that have bought a home , and they open up their windows and they see a half-finished house across the road from them , " he said .
" they 're now developing sewerage problems and all sorts of other health issues .
my heart seriously goes out to these people because they ca n't move on now . "
a need to face up to reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are new tram connections , but few passengers to use them the solution to these problems is one that may be unpalatable to banks , developers and property owners alike .
williams says that people need to acknowledge the realities of vast oversupply and start selling unoccupied properties in ghost estates at vastly knocked-down prices .
but there 's another looming problem that could make such steps immaterial : with tens of thousands of people expected to leave ireland in the coming years because of its economic problems , excess supply in the housing market may yet worsen further .

girls are subjected to fgm for a variety of reasons , explained christine loudes , director of the endfgm campaign at amnesty international .
" fgm is performed for non-therapeutic reasons , " loudes said .
" it 's done in the name of tradition , in the name of aesthetics and sometimes in the name of religion . "
fgm involves partially or completely removing the external female genitalia , and the practice is usually performed under unhygienic conditions and without anaesthesia on girls from their birth to 15 years of age .
fgm represents a severe violation of human rights .
" it constitutes torture and degrading treatment ; it violates women 's rights , and it violates rights to physical integrity as well as to children 's rights , to name a few , " loudes added .
fgm crosses borders africa is the most notable perpetrator regarding fgm , with some 30 countries subjecting girls to the practice .
but girls are threatened by the practice on other continents as well .
according to the european parliament , roughly 500,000 girls and women in europe have already been subjected to fgm or are in danger of becoming victims .
that number includes 75,000 girls and women in the uk , 65,000 in france and 30,000 in germany .
as loudes explains , it 's difficult to prove that fgm is actually being carried out on the ground in europe , but amnesty international does not want to rule out the possibility .
" i can not say that it 's hard evidence .
there 's anecdotal evidence that this is done in europe and that actually there is a cross-border dimension to it , " loudes said .
" but mostly we know that it 's happening when girls are going with their parents on holiday to their parents ' country of origin , and that 's where they are most at risk . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fgm is usually carried out under unhygienic conditions and without anaesthesia one fgm victim living in europe is aissatou diallo , a native of guinea who was mutilated in her home country at the age of 14 .
fearing that her own daughters might meet the same fate , the family came to belgium in 2007 as refugees .
diallo says she now lives with a sense of security .
" i 've noticed that since coming to belgium i 've had peace of mind , because my children go to school and they are safe here , " diallo said .
" i do n't come home and ask , ‘ where are my girls ?
did someone take them away to cut them ? ' , which is what often happens in my country .
so here i 've been able to enjoy life again , and i 've learned to rebuild myself psychologically . "
diallo may have found her footing in belgium , but christine loudes says that the recovery process is long and demanding for fgm victims who arrive in europe .
" they need a lot of healthcare support , " she stressed .
" in particular , some form of reparation is required for women whose vagina has been stitched together .
these women will need to be unstitched and they will need psychological support because it 's a practice that brings a lot of psychological and physical trauma . "
support for victims and health professionals run by amnesty international in coordination with non-government organizations in 11 different european countries , the endfgm campaign has set accessible healthcare for fgm victims living in europe as a priority .
in germany , for example , there is still work to be done in achieving this goal .
" the treatment and the operations needed for fgm victims are not covered by health insurance here , " explained shewa sium , director of the cologne-based refugee support organization agisra .
" the women have to pay for it themselves .
right now , we 're collecting signatures for a petition so that medical treatment for victims of fgm can also be covered by insurance companies . "
but it 's not just the fgm victims who need support .
organizations like amnesty international and agisra are calling on eu member states to give government workers the resources and training they need to tackle an issue they are unlikely to have encountered before .
" we hear a lot of health professionals , teachers and social workers are confronted with the practice , and they do n't know how to deal with the situation , " said christine loudes .
" the most difficult moment is at the time of giving birth , during which there is a lot of risk for the mother and the baby .
the fact that health professionals are not used to dealing with women who have undergone fgm means that there is often an emergency caesarean section .
this leads to increased costs in the health system as well as a higher risk for the women . "
because fgm has a lifelong physical and psychological impact on its victims , organizations like amnesty international also emphasize the need to protect girls and women at risk , often via asylum in europe .
the european union , however , lacks unified procedures and legislation when it comes to fgm .
" what is problematic is that each member state has a very different approach in relation to fgm , " explains loudes .
" in some cases it is recognized as persecution , and in other cases you get another status that is less protective and is only temporary .
in some countries , the level of awareness is very low , in particular in the new countries that have joined the eu .
we are trying to change this by providing some education to asylum officers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls are usually subjected to fgm between infancy and 15 years of age eu countries must act , says commisssion in an effort to achieve a streamlined , forceful approach against fgm from eu member states , the european commission is also taking steps .
viviane reding , the justice and fundamental rights commissioner , has flagged fgm as an issue in a five-year strategy for equality between women and men , and the commission may further target fgm in a new policy paper due out in february 2011 .
" the commission is going to come out with a strategy policy paper on violence in general and victims .
fgm is one of the priorities for the commission , " said mathew newman , spokesperson for commissioner reding .
" it 's possible that we will include it in the victims ' strategy .
it 's a horrible practice , and people need to know that .
they also need to know that the european union is working with member states to raise awareness and doing everything we can to stop it . "
while the eu 's efforts are welcome news for women like aissatou diallo , she cautions that european countries and their citizens must also treat the issue of fgm with sensitivity to avoid stigmatizing its victims .
" when we talk about terrible things that others do n't understand , we simply need to tell them : it 's as if you would take a child in europe and cut off an ear , an arm , or an eye .
the child has been mutilated ; it 's as simple as that , " she explained .
" it 's true that we 're not seen as complete women .
we 're seen as handicapped , almost .
but we are people like you , and as africans , we are fighting for change .
our hope is to be the last women in the world who have suffered from this practice . "

but critics say the plan misses the point and burdens domestic companies instead . as online advertising continues to grow rapidly throughout europe , french senators this week approved a new tax law aimed at securing the government to a piece of the revenue pie .
although the measure is popularly known as the " google tax " , it does not directly impact the internet giant , which has based its advertising business offshore and out of reach of french tax collectors .
instead , the one-percent charge will be levied on all french-based companies purchasing online publicity services .
the measure is expected to become law in 2011 and generate between 10 and 20 million euros per year if it is passed by the national assembly , as predicted .
supporters of the tax say it will put online advertising on an equality footing with other media .
broadcast and print advertisements are already subject to taxation in france .
television advertising alone pumps roughly 70 million euros into government coffers annually .
but critics say the government 's plan fails to meet its original goal : to tax the french operations of internet giants such as google , microsoft , ebay and amazon , which are located strategically in european countries with low corporate tax rates , such as ireland and luxembourg .
french business leaders fear the measure will burden small advertisers and lead to an exodus of larger internet stakeholders from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original goal of the levy was to tax offshore internet giants ' profits according to iab europe – an umbrella organization representing national trade associations for digital and interactive marketing – france 's online advertising market is europe 's third largest after the united kingdom and germany .
in 2009 , the uk market was worth 4 billion euros , the german market worth 3 billion , and the french market worth 1.7 billion .
kimon zorbas , vice president of iab europe , says the proposed law is shortsighted in that it hits french companies while giving their foreign competitors a break .
" our position is that this is a market which is already less than half the size of the english market .
france has a lot of catching up to do , and such a tax on a developing market is doubly negative , " he told deutsche welle .
" any tax is bound to have an effect on the market .
naturally the question now is how big of an effect , and that 's something we ca n't yet know . "
pattern of intervention recently , a distinctly french approach to the economic and cultural challenges presented by the internet has emerged .
in october the country announced a subsidy system under which young people can buy partially subsidized cards to purchase and download music with .
the program is intended to encourage the legal downloading of music over internet piracy .
it has also begun to send piracy warnings via email to illegal file sharers .
and in november france extended its 1981 lang law – which lets publishers set book prices and forbids booksellers from giving more than a 5 percent discount – to apply to e-books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy 's government has been grappling with internet issues karin von abrams , a london-based analyst for emarketer , tracks the french market and says that while governments are generally " very wary of hindering " the growth of online markets , it 's not surprising that france would seek to tax them .
" france has a history of very deliberate federal supervision of – and sometimes intervention in – the media , " she told deutsche welle .
" they also have a very strong history of federal subsidies for culture … they see inequalities developing , and are perhaps more likely to intervene because of their historical attitudes in this respect . "
zorbas added that specialized national taxes could create disunity among european nations trying to increase their combined market share , and that attempts to create boundaries in the internet " just ca n't work out . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 25.11.2010 ahead of summit , groups urge eu to reexamine africa trade policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana 's poultry industry is near a halt due to uneven trade with the eu several german development groups have called for improvement in eu trade policy with africa ahead of a joint eu-africa summit . some non-governmental groups have warned the european union not to let negotiations fail on a free trade agreement between african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- countries , and the eu , when the parties meet for a summit in tripoli , libya , on nov .
29 and 30 .
until now , only a few limited deals - so-called economic partnership agreements - have been made between the eu and select acp nations .
while the eu and the acp group of nations have had a common free-trade agreement since 2002 , so far , that agreement has done little for africa , according to ngos like oxfam , misereor and the german church development group , evangelischer entwicklungsdienst .
and according to these groups , the blame lies entirely with europe .
skepticism , hope ahead of meeting now , the african nations are demanding that 80 percent of all tariffs on imported goods be abolished .
at the same time , they want the export of raw materials to be restricted .
for its part , the european union is pressing for free-trade for services . african countries would have little hope of being able to export services themselves , since the service industry is far less expansive there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxfam is one of the groups calling for change after years of unsuccessful negotiations , oxfam trade policy advisor david hachfeld said he is sceptical about the chances that next week ’ s summit will bring the two continents onto the same page .
and he is worried that individual countries may decide to take unilateral action .
" if most of the countries in a particular region want to refuse services , but one or two countries in that region want the services , then the european union is prepared to keep working with those one or two countries , " hachfield said .
" that would be devastating in my opinion , and i hope the african countries won ’ t let themselves be divided like that . "
but offah obale , a cameroonian consultant for the african union , is more optimistic .
he says the fact that 80 heads of state are expected to attend the tripoli summit make it a unique opportunity to resolve the trade dispute between the eu and africa at the highest political level .
warning on increased poverty " i think it will be hypocritical for african and european leaders to continue going to new york and talk about achieving millenium goals by 2015 and not talk about the major instrument , " obale said .
" so my major expectation in the area of trade is that the summit at the end of this month will come out with a consensus on the way forward with respect to economic partnership agreements . "
senegalese ndiaga mboub , who works with the world health organisation in geneva , switzerland , added that if nothing changes , trade policy between africa and the eu will only serve to increase poverty across africa .
more far-reaching change in african industry is needed to overcome what he described as a new kind of colonialism .
" the problem is that africa ca n't develop on its own , in that it exports raw materials and agricultural products to europe , " he said .
" not one single country is going to make any progress if it doesn ’ t develop its own industry .
it 's still the case that africa sends raw materials off to european factories where they 're processed further , for example in the oil industry . "
oxfam 's hachfeld said that he increasingly questions the eu 's africa strategy because other countries are already on the way to outpacing the eu in terms of striking trade deals .
" why should african countries be so reliant on the european union when they can see that the growth rates in trade with india , china , and brazil are three times as high as they are with the eu ? " he asks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some farmers in africa have suffered under increased eu exports poultry and dairy industries suffer african agriculture has suffered under the current trade imbalances .
for example , poultry breeding and processing in ghana has ground almost to a halt , because the eu has increased its exports to the country from almost 5,000 tons in 1998 to 90,000 tons in 2009 .
another example is dairy exports to africa , which rose by over 40 percent between 2005 and 2008 .
these jumps in eu exports might be good news for european farmers .
but german development groups have said they are coming at the expense of african farmers , and they want the situation to change .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . nikolaus is coming he may look similar to santa claus , but he is not quite the same thing .
in germany , saint nicholas - known as nikolaus - also has a white beard and carries a sack full of presents on his back , but he visits children in the wee hours of december 6 .
this date is not incidental , as december 6 is when people called nikolaus celebrate their name day in germany , in honor of the saint 's birthday . the story behind the event goes back to the third and fourth century ad .
saint nicholas - originally known as nikolaos of myra - was a greek bishop .
he had a reputation for gift-giving , which is why he also became the model for santa claus .
he is also known as the patron saint of children . in germany , kids eagerly await nikolaus each year .
they traditionally put a boot outside the front door on the evening of december 5 , expecting saint nicholas to fill it with gifts and sweets while they sleep .
this crucial part is usually performed by the parents , of course , but they like to make their children believe that saint nicholas rewards those who have been good and polite throughout the year . on the other hand , the german equivalent of santa claus - called weihnachtsmann -lrb- christmas man -rrb- - comes on christmas eve , along with the christkind -lrb- christ child -rrb- who is also a traditional gift-bringer in germany and other parts of central europe .
the figure of the christkind goes back to the times of martin luther , who , in line with his protestant teachings , discouraged the worship of saints , including saint nicholas . bildunterschrift : both nikolaus and santa claus were based on the same early christian saint results of the latest education study how good is the german education system ?
when the first pisa -lrb- programme for international student assessment -rrb- study came out in 2001 - a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school students ' scholastic performance - germany did not score particularly well .
the country 's media used terms like " pisa shock " to reflect the general disappointment . the study has been carried out every three years since then , with the latest results , due to be released on december 7 , focusing on reading abilities .
however , there is some controversy about how accurately the study really reflects the quality of an education system .
some critics point out that a student 's performance is influenced by many factors , and so it can not be explained by the quality of the school system alone . nevertheless , since the study came into existence , many are looking toward finland for guidance , as this northern european nation regularly scores excellent marks in pisa .
some believe that the german school system may be at fault after all .
the german tradition of dividing students into different types of high schools based on their academic performance has already been disputed and debated for quite some time .
and the pisa study only helps to fan the flames of this debate . big names on the big screen a much talked-about new movie by florian henckel von donnersmarck , " the tourist , " debuts in german movie theaters on december 16 .
the director won the academy award for best foreign language film in 2007 for his east-germany-based drama " the lives of others . " the film , which features hollywood stars angelina jolie and johnny depp in the main roles , is a thriller set in venice about an american tourist -lrb- depp -rrb- who is used by an english woman -lrb- jolie -rrb- in an attempt to mislead those following her criminal ex-lover . bildunterschrift : angelina jolie und johnny depp star in " the tourist " napoleon exhibition talking about your country 's history is not always easy - the germans know this all too well .
in the case of france , this problem relates to its former ruler and military leader napoleon bonaparte .
many french people are not proud of his imperialistic conquests and demonstrations of power , so it is not easy to organize an exhibition on the topic in his homeland , according to the spokesperson for the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany in bonn . from december 17 , the art and exhibition hall will host the exhibition " napoleon and europe .
dream and trauma , " which aims to explain who napoleon really was and how he rose to power .
items on display include original documents , paintings and everyday objects .
the exhibition 's curator is french scholar benedicte savoy , who teaches art history at the berlin institute of technology .
the exhibition will travel to france in march next year .

during this time , an advent wreath decorates the tables in many german households .
this tradition can be traced back to johann hinrich wichern , a 19th-century german protestant pastor , who invented the wreath to make the advent time seem shorter for children , since they could light one candle in it each day . some theaters in germany offer a special advent program , where on each of the days between december 1 and december 24 -lrb- christmas eve -rrb- a little " door " is opened to reveal entertaining acts such as story-reading , dancing and music . and once christmas is over , it is soon time for new year 's eve .

so-called " ghost estates " now blight the republic , with many homes left unoccupied or unfinished . ask a taxi driver in dublin to take you to a " ghost estate , " and a kind one will point out that you can walk there and do n't actually need a cab .
there are several examples of unfinished or largely unoccupied housing developments in the irish capital , one of which is called spencer dock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while there may be lots of housing , there are few real homes spencer dock 's developers say the project will be completed and residency rates will rise , but it is currently far emptier than they would like , and stationary cranes dot the landscape with unfinished buildings breaking the skyline . apart from the main road a street away , there is little activity - the sound of children playing outside is rarely heard , for example , according to those people who have taken up residence .
there is also a shiny new tram line , but very few people waiting to use it .
it is hard to find irish residents living in this development off the banks of the river liffey and just outside the center of dublin .
mikaela ekman moved here from sweden .
she acknowledged the strange atmosphere in the largely empty neighborhood .
" yeah , it 's very half finished ! " she said , laughing and pointing to the cranes around nearby buildings .
spencer dock 's developers have even had to launch legal action against customers who agreed to buy property on the site but have changed their mind in view of plummeting home values and low residency .
a problem not confined to dublin there are far too many buildings for people in ireland , according to brendan williams , a lecturer in urban development at university college dublin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williams says housing supply vastly outstrips demand " we estimate that the overproduction or oversupply in the housing area is approximately 17 percent ; in other areas , such as commercial and offices , it 's of the order of 20 percent , " he said .
" there is also an oversupply in other sectors as well , such as hotels . "
williams says construction continued at a rapid pace in the irish republic long after signs appeared that the economy was cooling , with disastrous effects for irish banks that invested heavily in the housing boom .
" in a general sense , there was an oversupply and an overbuilding that continued largely through the period 2004-2009 , which contributed , obviously , to the eventual failure of the property market . "
nearly 100,000 homes were built in 2006 alone .
williams said house prices have crashed by as much as 50 percent from their peak .
that has wiped billions of euros off the balance sheets of the banks .
what now for ghost estates ?
it 's not clear exactly how many homes are unoccupied across ireland .
some estimates put the figure as high as 300,000 .
what is clear is that for the few residents who live in the ghost estates , life can be miserable .
some have such low occupancy rates that shopkeepers have declined to open in the area ; on some one side of the road is finished , while the other is not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steven lewis is very aware of the problems of living on a ghost estate steven lewis is one of those who has chosen to live on what he himself describes as a ghost estate just outside dublin .
he has done so because rent is cheap , but admits there is a downside .
" i 've had my car broken into three times this year , " he said , acknowledging the problems with crime on estates where little pride is felt by residents for their unfinished surroundings .
steven sympathizes with those people who actually bought property where he lives .
" my heart goes out to working class families that have bought a home , and they open up their windows and they see a half-finished house across the road from them , " he said .
" they 're now developing sewerage problems and all sorts of other health issues .
my heart seriously goes out to these people because they ca n't move on now . "
a need to face up to reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are new tram connections , but few passengers to use them the solution to these problems is one that may be unpalatable to banks , developers and property owners alike .
williams says that people need to acknowledge the realities of vast oversupply and start selling unoccupied properties in ghost estates at vastly knocked-down prices .
but there 's another looming problem that could make such steps immaterial : with tens of thousands of people expected to leave ireland in the coming years because of its economic problems , excess supply in the housing market may yet worsen further .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 25.11.2010 france plans to introduce new ' google tax ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris thinks google could contribute more to french coffers the french senate has approved a new tax on online advertising services offered by internet giants such as google .
but critics say the plan misses the point and burdens domestic companies instead . as online advertising continues to grow rapidly throughout europe , french senators this week approved a new tax law aimed at securing the government to a piece of the revenue pie .
although the measure is popularly known as the " google tax " , it does not directly impact the internet giant , which has based its advertising business offshore and out of reach of french tax collectors .
instead , the one-percent charge will be levied on all french-based companies purchasing online publicity services .
the measure is expected to become law in 2011 and generate between 10 and 20 million euros per year if it is passed by the national assembly , as predicted .
supporters of the tax say it will put online advertising on an equality footing with other media .
broadcast and print advertisements are already subject to taxation in france .
television advertising alone pumps roughly 70 million euros into government coffers annually .
but critics say the government 's plan fails to meet its original goal : to tax the french operations of internet giants such as google , microsoft , ebay and amazon , which are located strategically in european countries with low corporate tax rates , such as ireland and luxembourg .
french business leaders fear the measure will burden small advertisers and lead to an exodus of larger internet stakeholders from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original goal of the levy was to tax offshore internet giants ' profits according to iab europe – an umbrella organization representing national trade associations for digital and interactive marketing – france 's online advertising market is europe 's third largest after the united kingdom and germany .
in 2009 , the uk market was worth 4 billion euros , the german market worth 3 billion , and the french market worth 1.7 billion .
kimon zorbas , vice president of iab europe , says the proposed law is shortsighted in that it hits french companies while giving their foreign competitors a break .
" our position is that this is a market which is already less than half the size of the english market .
france has a lot of catching up to do , and such a tax on a developing market is doubly negative , " he told deutsche welle .
" any tax is bound to have an effect on the market .
naturally the question now is how big of an effect , and that 's something we ca n't yet know . "
pattern of intervention recently , a distinctly french approach to the economic and cultural challenges presented by the internet has emerged .
in october the country announced a subsidy system under which young people can buy partially subsidized cards to purchase and download music with .
the program is intended to encourage the legal downloading of music over internet piracy .
it has also begun to send piracy warnings via email to illegal file sharers .
and in november france extended its 1981 lang law – which lets publishers set book prices and forbids booksellers from giving more than a 5 percent discount – to apply to e-books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy 's government has been grappling with internet issues karin von abrams , a london-based analyst for emarketer , tracks the french market and says that while governments are generally " very wary of hindering " the growth of online markets , it 's not surprising that france would seek to tax them .
" france has a history of very deliberate federal supervision of – and sometimes intervention in – the media , " she told deutsche welle .
" they also have a very strong history of federal subsidies for culture … they see inequalities developing , and are perhaps more likely to intervene because of their historical attitudes in this respect . "
zorbas added that specialized national taxes could create disunity among european nations trying to increase their combined market share , and that attempts to create boundaries in the internet " just ca n't work out . "

his comments come ahead of a two-day visit to germany . russia is aiming for a free trade zone and a common industrial policy with the european union .
prime minister vladimir putin , writing in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung on thursday , said his goal was to create " a harmonious economic community from lisbon to vladivostok . "
cooperation between russia and the eu could even result in a free trade agreement or similar forms of economic integration eventually leading to a " common continental market . "
" we should be frank about it : the global economic crisis has revealed both russia and the eu to be economically very vulnerable , " putin wrote .
russia , he argued , was still too dependent on its energy exports , while the eu was in danger of jeopardizing its position on the international markets , due to a decrease in its industrial productivity .
" what 's on the agenda : how can we trigger a new wave of industrialization to roll across europe , " putin wrote .
different takes on energy cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' both russia and the eu have been shown to be economically very vulnerable ' : putin he suggested strategic alliances in key industries , including shipbuilding , car manufacturing , space exploration and the pharmaceutical industry .
energy policy , putin wrote , was another field where closer cooperation was needed .
from nuclear technology to gas and oil exploitation , there was a need for closer ties with brussels .
the european union gets around 25 percent of its natural gas from russia .
in the past , however , brussels has left little doubt that it wants to diversify its energy supply to reduce dependency on russia .
interruptions to the supply have in recent years lead to energy shortages in several eu member states .
putin also called for easing and eventually lifting visa restrictions between the eu and russia .
this , he wrote , would bring about not the end but rather the beginning of true integration between his country and the 27-nation bloc .
putin 's comments preceded his visit to germany , which starts on thursday .
he is scheduled to meet with german chancellor angela merkel on friday .
merkel , meanwhile , has downplayed the chances of a possible free trade zone .
speaking to reporters in berlin on thursday , she pointed to russian high tariffs and moscow 's trade relations with neighboring countries as potential stumbling blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas transit interruptions have led to tensions with moscow " of course we support the idea of a free trade zone between the eu and russia but i have to pour a bit of cold water on it , " she said .
" the steps that russia has taken recently do not point in that direction . "
she pointed out that russia , not yet part of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , has established trade ties with kazakhstan and belarus , countries whose statuses as potential wto members are far less certain than russia 's .
eon , gazprom on the agenda merkel and putin are also expected to discuss german energy company eon possibly selling its shares in russia 's gazprom .
media reports on wednesday suggested eon plans to drop the 3.5 percent stake it holds in the russian energy giant .
eon had dismissed reports that it would sell its 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- in shares , while a government spokesman in berlin confirmed the issue was on the agenda of the merkel-putin talks .
the eu is russia 's largest trading partner , making up about one half of its foreign trade .
total trade in the first half of the year was $ 141.9 billion -lrb- 106.3 billion euros -rrb- , according to the russian federal customs agency .

his comments come ahead of a two-day visit to germany . russia is aiming for a free trade zone and a common industrial policy with the european union .
prime minister vladimir putin , writing in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung on thursday , said his goal was to create " a harmonious economic community from lisbon to vladivostok . "
cooperation between russia and the eu could even result in a free trade agreement or similar forms of economic integration eventually leading to a " common continental market . "
" we should be frank about it : the global economic crisis has revealed both russia and the eu to be economically very vulnerable , " putin wrote .
russia , he argued , was still too dependent on its energy exports , while the eu was in danger of jeopardizing its position on the international markets , due to a decrease in its industrial productivity .
" what 's on the agenda : how can we trigger a new wave of industrialization to roll across europe , " putin wrote .
different takes on energy cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' both russia and the eu have been shown to be economically very vulnerable ' : putin he suggested strategic alliances in key industries , including shipbuilding , car manufacturing , space exploration and the pharmaceutical industry .
energy policy , putin wrote , was another field where closer cooperation was needed .
from nuclear technology to gas and oil exploitation , there was a need for closer ties with brussels .
the european union gets around 25 percent of its natural gas from russia .
in the past , however , brussels has left little doubt that it wants to diversify its energy supply to reduce dependency on russia .
interruptions to the supply have in recent years lead to energy shortages in several eu member states .
putin also called for easing and eventually lifting visa restrictions between the eu and russia .
this , he wrote , would bring about not the end but rather the beginning of true integration between his country and the 27-nation bloc .
putin 's comments preceded his visit to germany , which starts on thursday .
he is scheduled to meet with german chancellor angela merkel on friday .
merkel , meanwhile , has downplayed the chances of a possible free trade zone .
speaking to reporters in berlin on thursday , she pointed to russian high tariffs and moscow 's trade relations with neighboring countries as potential stumbling blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas transit interruptions have led to tensions with moscow " of course we support the idea of a free trade zone between the eu and russia but i have to pour a bit of cold water on it , " she said .
" the steps that russia has taken recently do not point in that direction . "
she pointed out that russia , not yet part of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , has established trade ties with kazakhstan and belarus , countries whose statuses as potential wto members are far less certain than russia 's .
eon , gazprom on the agenda merkel and putin are also expected to discuss german energy company eon possibly selling its shares in russia 's gazprom .
media reports on wednesday suggested eon plans to drop the 3.5 percent stake it holds in the russian energy giant .
eon had dismissed reports that it would sell its 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- in shares , while a government spokesman in berlin confirmed the issue was on the agenda of the merkel-putin talks .
the eu is russia 's largest trading partner , making up about one half of its foreign trade .
total trade in the first half of the year was $ 141.9 billion -lrb- 106.3 billion euros -rrb- , according to the russian federal customs agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 25.11.2010 schalke 's confidence soars in europe while bremen plumbs new depths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could raul and schalke be about to take flight in europe ?
schalke 04 joined bayern munich in the last 16 of the champions league after a confident 3-0 win over lyon which hinted at a long-awaited return to form .
meanwhile , werder bremen continue to plumb the depths of despair . a team which had been struggling with a new faces and new tactics suddenly finds its feet in november , begins climbing the rungs in the bundesliga and marches in to the knockout stage of the champions league .
sound familiar ?
the story of bayern munich 's rise last season began , in some ways , like the unfolding tale of schalke 04 's campaign this time around .
bayern may never have flirted with the drop zone , but they began the season far off the pace .
right around the time christmas markets began opening up across the land , however , they found their rhythm - and built up the head of steam which carried them to their very successful end .
it remains fanciful to believe that schalke ’ s recent rampant form will be the start of a rise from the bottom to the top , resulting in schalke snatching the title in may , but it certainly appears - like bayern before them - that november is the month in which this schalke team began to click .
europe becomes schalke 's playground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huntelaar -lrb- m . -rrb- scored twice in schalke 's win over lyon schalke , in contrast to their wretched league from , have played well in europe nearly from the outset .
after a blip in their first group game at lyon , they have since won three and drawn one , a run of results which has seen them qualify for the knock-out rounds with a game to spare .
they could even go through as group winners .
wednesday night 's performance at home to lyon was the strongest indicator yet that schalke have turned a corner .
the team 's movement and one-touch passing was of such quality that it was hard to believe they were the same group that had sunk so desperately low in the bundesliga .
this was a truly european performance , with jefferson farfan and jose manuel jurado showing ingenuity and pace enough to rip the french defense to shreds .
raul , meanwhile , showed a growing belief in his new team , and klaas jan huntelaar 's rediscovered scoring touch can only bode well for the coming weeks .
schalke looked like they knew exactly what to do , and precisely what coach felix magath wanted from them .
even the royal blues ' defense , which has been shaky at best for most of the season , gave a commanding performance ; the much-maligned christoph metzelder and benedikt hoewedes in particular gave towering displays to cut out the threat from lyon 's ordinarily potent offense led by yoann gourcuff and lisandro lopez .
magath will now have confidence that his jigsaw is finally settling in place and that schalke can continue their climb out of the lower reaches of the bundesliga while progressing with flair in europe .
bremen in crisis as confidence goes awol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down and out : bremen 's loss to spurs ended their hopes werder bremen coach thomas schaaf has it worse - much worse .
taken apart by schalke last weekend in the league and dumped out of europe by tottenham hotspur on wednesday night , the north german club look destined to spend the remaining months of the season engaged in a fight for belief , if not survival , while felix magath 's side rub shoulders with the likes of barcelona , real madrid and manchester united .
bremen look such a broken team that it 's hard to see where any kind of recovery will come from .
the team werder sent out at white hart lane on wednesday was a mix of shell-shocked veterans and overwhelmed reserves who were getting a game only because of the team ’ s injury woes .
tottenham were 2-0 up at half time , but the way the beleaguered bremen squad left the pitch at the interval , they may as well have stayed in the locker room and taken the forfeit .
-lrb- the game did end 3-0 , as it happened . -rrb-
in the end , it did n't matter what the deficit was - werder were eliminated from the champions league .
moreover , they would need to beat european champions inter milan in their final group game , and make up a seven goal difference on fc twente to even have a chance of a place in the europa league place .
in other words , it ’ s not happening .
bremen have a north german derby on sunday against fc st. pauli which would usually be billed as a david and goliath clash .
on recent form though , it 's hard to say which is the skinny boy with the sling .
bremen 's response to dropping out of european competition for another season at home to pauli this weekend may determine their season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.11.2010 germany 's economics minister touts economic ' fairy tale ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers are heading back to the shops speaking to the german parliament , economics minister rainer bruederle has said domestic demand is back , and stronger than expected .
but the opposition thinks not everyone is benefitting from the boom . just in time for the christmas , it seems german consumers are rediscovering the joys of shopping .
speaking to the lower house of the german parliament on thursday , economics minister rainer bruederle said domestic demand was on the upswing and stronger than expected , as consumers were once again feeling comfortable enough to go out and spend .
" we 're consuming again , people are doing well and people are spending again , " said bruederle , calling the economic upswing like something " out of a fairy tale . "
germany 's gross domestic product is expected to grow by about 3.5 percent this year , nearing a two-decade high , and by 2.6 percent in 2011 .
bruederle said under the governing center-right coalition of the christian democrats and the liberal free democrats , germany has become the economic model for all of europe , adding that the country could expect to enjoy its current economic growth for the foreseeable future .
the market research firm gfk said consumer morale rose more than expected in november , for the sixth month in a row .
and german business sentiment rose to its strongest level since 1991 in november , according to the ifo economic think tank .
in october , unemployment fell to an 18-year low , dropping below three million for the first time since november 2008 .
bruederle is convinced that full employment could soon be a possibility , adding that in many regions in the south of the country this was already a reality .
opposition calls for wage increases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said germany had become the economic model for all of europe however , the opposition greens , social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and left party criticized bruederle 's comments , saying the economic boom was leaving the unemployed , retired and poor behind .
garrelt duin , of the spd , said the economic upswing was not stable or balanced .
he said both domestic investment and wages needed to increase , to support the increased domestic demand .
michael schlecht of the left party pointed out that while businesses were enjoying a growth in profits of up to 40 percent , wages had hardly followed suit .
he said that since 2000 , businesses had seen incomes increase by at least 50 percent , but the income of the average worker has actually dropped .
schlecht also said austerity programs in other european union countries , such as greece and ireland , would have a negative trickledown effect on german exports , on which germany has traditionally relied to support its growth .
he called for a reversal of the reforms to the “ hartz iv ” welfare subsidy program and for the introduction of a set minimum wage of 10 euros -lrb- $ 13.4 -rrb- per hour , to shore up the domestic growth sector .

this discovery could be used to develop better microchips for computers or more efficient solar energy technology , according to their research which was published in the journal nature on thursday .
bose-einstein condensates -lrb- bec -rrb- were first proposed in the 1920s by satyendra nath bose and albert einstein , who asserted that atoms , chilled to very near absolute zero , would take on quantum characteristics , so that the atoms " overlap , and behave as a giant meta-wave , " or a sort of super-atom , wherein a collection of atoms all act in concert , weitz told deutsche welle .
not everyone in the field of quantum optics is happy with the term super-atom or super-photon though , such as aephraim steinberg , a quantum physicist at the university of toronto .
" i find the word a little confusing and misleading , so i wouldn ’ t really want to call this a super photon , " steinberg said . within the bec there is still a collection of weakly interacting particles ; they don ’ t merge together to create a new molecule or new solid , but they take on an additional property that they all want to behave the same way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin weitz and his team worked on the experiment for three years " so it 's no more a super-atom than an army is a super person ; there may be ten thousand people marching in the same direction , but they 're not some sort of new creature , " steinberg said . the bec state was previously believed to apply only to atoms and not to photons , since the cooling process would force the photons to be absorbed by surrounding atoms in the apparatus . " if you cool down light , normally the light goes away , " weitz explained .
" if you turn off a light bulb then the filament cools down and it changes its color from yellow to red , as the number of photons is reduced , becoming dimmer and dimmer until they disappear entirely . " photons acting like atoms but now weitz , along with jan klaers , julian schmitt and frank vewinger , has managed to create a photonic bec at room temperature by trapping photons between two concave mirrors . the experiment also made use of liquid dye pigment that cooled the photons down to room temperature while they were trapped between the two mirrors .
when enough photons were pumped into this apparatus , a bec state was observed " which appeared as a yellow peak in the middle and there the photons marched in step , " weitz said . the discovery took three years of research and is being hailed as a major breakthrough in the field of quantum physics . matthias weidemueller , a quantum physicist at the university of freiburg , said in the journal nature that the experiment was " truly ingenious . " " compared to bose-einstein condensation with ultracold atoms , the current experiment is ridiculously simple , " he said . but some in the field maintain that , while the results are welcome and that the concept of a bec of photons was controversial , it 's not completely unexpected .
aephraim steinberg , a quantum physicist at the university of toronto , says quantum mechanics basically dictate that all bosons , a category which includes rubidium-87 atoms used in atomic bec , as well as photons , want to act in the same way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one potential application would be the creation of shortwave lasers " i think there 's been a lot of confusion and i think -lrb- this experiment -rrb- helps clarify some fundamental physics to see that , at a deep level , all particles are really the same , whether it ’ s a boson of light or a boson of rubidium , they really do have the same properties if you put them in the right circumstances , " steinberg said in a telephone interview . putting it to work weitz has a couple of ideas for applications resulting from the research at the university of bonn .
creating shortwave lasers in the x-ray or ultra-violet spectrum is one such idea . such shortwave lasers would be well-suited to the manufacture of computer chips as the process uses lasers to etch logic circuits onto semiconductor materials .
the precision of shortwave lasers is superior to those with longer wavelengths , which would allow chip designers to create more complex circuitry on the same area of silcon . another possible application using this apparatus , but with less light , weitz said , would be to concentrate the light for solar cells .
by placing the apparatus before a solar cell , " you could save a lot of money because you could use smaller solar cells but nevertheless , get all the light , " weitz said . weitz and his colleagues will now be focusing on learning more about the photonic bec they 've created , and also attempting to simplify the apparatus by switching out the liquid dye currently used , for a solid-state dye , which would require less equipment to manage . author : stuart tiffen editor : nicole goebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

faber escaped a dutch prison in 1952 and has since lived a quiet life in germany . authorities in the netherlands have issued a european arrest warrant for a convicted nazi war criminal living in germany .
dutch-born klaas carel faber had been sentenced to death by a netherlands court in 1947 for the murder of several prisoners in the westerbork transit camp in 1944 .
the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1948 .
faber escaped from prison in 1952 .
he fled across the border to west germany , where he later received citizenship , and moved to bavaria .
faber served in a special ss death squad that was tasked with killing dutch civilians classified as " anti-german " or linked to dutch resistance in the german-occupied netherlands .
the 88-year old is high on the simon wiesenthal center 's list of wanted nazi criminals .
the israeli government has also repeatedly called for him to be brought to justice .
extradition request to follow berlin , however , has so far refused to extradite him .
in 1957 a court in dusseldorf dismissed charges against faber for lack of evidence brought against him .
a dutch extradition request in 2004 was turned down with reference to that 1957 decision .
in 2006 new evidence was brought before a court in munich , but the judges saw the cases as manslaughter rather than murder - which meant the crimes had lapsed under the statute of limitations .
in order to re-examine the case with new evidence , a new arrest warrant from dutch authorities was needed .
dutch public prosecutors are for the first time trying to use the european arrest warrant system , which has been in place since 2002 .
the arrest warrant for faber is a preliminary step before the formal extradition request to germany .
in march 2010 a german court convicted heinrich boere - another member of faber 's unit - and sentenced him to life imprisonment .
boere 's lawyers have appealed the verdict .

yet financial markets remain nervous , fearing that spain and portugal may be next in line for eu aid . eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs olli rehn has applauded ireland 's 15-billion-euro -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- austerity package as " a sound basis for the negotiations " on an international bailout . ireland has set out a four-year plan to save the 15 billion euros in order to secure an international bailout expected to be in the region of 85 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts do not necessarily share olli rehn 's confidence under the national recovery plan , the irish republic aims to bring its budget deficit down from a projected 32 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to three percent of gdp by 2014 by imposing tax increases , wage cuts and by curbing public spending .
irish prime minister brian cowen conceded that the average living standard in his country was likely to suffer as a result of the severe cuts .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicholas sarkozy were said to be " impressed " with the recovery program , after discussing the situation in ireland by telephone on thursday .
a statement from the chancellor 's office added that both leaders " agreed that negotiations with the irish government must be rapidly concluded . " 85 billion - or more the drastic austerity measures are the condition for ireland to receive help from eu funds .
cowen has given 85 billion euros as the sum that his country would need , but negotiations with brussels and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- are still ongoing .
experts , however , warn that more money could be needed to avoid the former celtic tiger from sliding into bankruptcy .
constantin gurdgiev , an economist at trinity college in dublin , said the situation was even worse than in greece .
" our economy has more than three times more debt .
if greece is bankrupt - what then are we ? " he asked .
in the wake of the crisis in ireland international financial markets are getting increasingly nervous about portugal and spain .
both countries are feared to be the next possible candidates in need of an eu bailout .
" there 's nothing that politics can do to ease that tension on the markets , " lueder gerken , head of the center for european policy , told the neue rhein zeitung daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is expected by many to be the next eu country in need of help from brussels " of course there will be a domino effect - regardless of what 'll happen in ireland .
the markets have already set their eyes on portugal , and spain too looks to be set for trouble , " he added .
portugal , spain insist they wo n't be next herman van rompuy , head of the eu council , is trying to calm those concerns .
he said that any fears of a repeat of the irish crisis in portugal were baseless .

yet financial markets remain nervous , fearing that spain and portugal may be next in line for eu aid . eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs olli rehn has applauded ireland 's 15-billion-euro -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- austerity package as " a sound basis for the negotiations " on an international bailout . ireland has set out a four-year plan to save the 15 billion euros in order to secure an international bailout expected to be in the region of 85 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts do not necessarily share olli rehn 's confidence under the national recovery plan , the irish republic aims to bring its budget deficit down from a projected 32 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to three percent of gdp by 2014 by imposing tax increases , wage cuts and by curbing public spending .
irish prime minister brian cowen conceded that the average living standard in his country was likely to suffer as a result of the severe cuts .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicholas sarkozy were said to be " impressed " with the recovery program , after discussing the situation in ireland by telephone on thursday .
a statement from the chancellor 's office added that both leaders " agreed that negotiations with the irish government must be rapidly concluded . " 85 billion - or more the drastic austerity measures are the condition for ireland to receive help from eu funds .
cowen has given 85 billion euros as the sum that his country would need , but negotiations with brussels and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- are still ongoing .
experts , however , warn that more money could be needed to avoid the former celtic tiger from sliding into bankruptcy .
constantin gurdgiev , an economist at trinity college in dublin , said the situation was even worse than in greece .
" our economy has more than three times more debt .
if greece is bankrupt - what then are we ? " he asked .
in the wake of the crisis in ireland international financial markets are getting increasingly nervous about portugal and spain .
both countries are feared to be the next possible candidates in need of an eu bailout .
" there 's nothing that politics can do to ease that tension on the markets , " lueder gerken , head of the center for european policy , told the neue rhein zeitung daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is expected by many to be the next eu country in need of help from brussels " of course there will be a domino effect - regardless of what 'll happen in ireland .
the markets have already set their eyes on portugal , and spain too looks to be set for trouble , " he added .
portugal , spain insist they wo n't be next herman van rompuy , head of the eu council , is trying to calm those concerns .
he said that any fears of a repeat of the irish crisis in portugal were baseless .
portugal 's debt was lower , there was n't a real estate crisis there , and the banks had enough capital reserves , van rompuy said .
" all that talk has neither an economic nor a rational basis . "
portuguese prime minister jose socrates also tried to reassure the public that his country would not need any eu help .

faber escaped a dutch prison in 1952 and has since lived a quiet life in germany . authorities in the netherlands have issued a european arrest warrant for a convicted nazi war criminal living in germany .
dutch-born klaas carel faber had been sentenced to death by a netherlands court in 1947 for the murder of several prisoners in the westerbork transit camp in 1944 .
the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1948 .
faber escaped from prison in 1952 .
he fled across the border to west germany , where he later received citizenship , and moved to bavaria .
faber served in a special ss death squad that was tasked with killing dutch civilians classified as " anti-german " or linked to dutch resistance in the german-occupied netherlands .
the 88-year old is high on the simon wiesenthal center 's list of wanted nazi criminals .
the israeli government has also repeatedly called for him to be brought to justice .
extradition request to follow berlin , however , has so far refused to extradite him .
in 1957 a court in dusseldorf dismissed charges against faber for lack of evidence brought against him .
a dutch extradition request in 2004 was turned down with reference to that 1957 decision .
in 2006 new evidence was brought before a court in munich , but the judges saw the cases as manslaughter rather than murder - which meant the crimes had lapsed under the statute of limitations .
in order to re-examine the case with new evidence , a new arrest warrant from dutch authorities was needed .
dutch public prosecutors are for the first time trying to use the european arrest warrant system , which has been in place since 2002 .
the arrest warrant for faber is a preliminary step before the formal extradition request to germany .
in march 2010 a german court convicted heinrich boere - another member of faber 's unit - and sentenced him to life imprisonment .
boere 's lawyers have appealed the verdict .

but the opposition thinks not everyone is benefitting from the boom . just in time for the christmas , it seems german consumers are rediscovering the joys of shopping .
speaking to the lower house of the german parliament on thursday , economics minister rainer bruederle said domestic demand was on the upswing and stronger than expected , as consumers were once again feeling comfortable enough to go out and spend .
" we 're consuming again , people are doing well and people are spending again , " said bruederle , calling the economic upswing like something " out of a fairy tale . "
germany 's gross domestic product is expected to grow by about 3.5 percent this year , nearing a two-decade high , and by 2.6 percent in 2011 .
bruederle said under the governing center-right coalition of the christian democrats and the liberal free democrats , germany has become the economic model for all of europe , adding that the country could expect to enjoy its current economic growth for the foreseeable future .
the market research firm gfk said consumer morale rose more than expected in november , for the sixth month in a row .
and german business sentiment rose to its strongest level since 1991 in november , according to the ifo economic think tank .
in october , unemployment fell to an 18-year low , dropping below three million for the first time since november 2008 .
bruederle is convinced that full employment could soon be a possibility , adding that in many regions in the south of the country this was already a reality .
opposition calls for wage increases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said germany had become the economic model for all of europe however , the opposition greens , social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and left party criticized bruederle 's comments , saying the economic boom was leaving the unemployed , retired and poor behind .
garrelt duin , of the spd , said the economic upswing was not stable or balanced .
he said both domestic investment and wages needed to increase , to support the increased domestic demand .
michael schlecht of the left party pointed out that while businesses were enjoying a growth in profits of up to 40 percent , wages had hardly followed suit .
he said that since 2000 , businesses had seen incomes increase by at least 50 percent , but the income of the average worker has actually dropped .
schlecht also said austerity programs in other european union countries , such as greece and ireland , would have a negative trickledown effect on german exports , on which germany has traditionally relied to support its growth .
he called for a reversal of the reforms to the “ hartz iv ” welfare subsidy program and for the introduction of a set minimum wage of 10 euros -lrb- $ 13.4 -rrb- per hour , to shore up the domestic growth sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 25.11.2010 december 2010 : dw 's culture calendar from music and art to film and dance - find out what 's going on in germany 's cultural scene .
deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . nikolaus is coming he may look similar to santa claus , but he is not quite the same thing .
in germany , saint nicholas - known as nikolaus - also has a white beard and carries a sack full of presents on his back , but he visits children in the wee hours of december 6 .
this date is not incidental , as december 6 is when people called nikolaus celebrate their name day in germany , in honor of the saint 's birthday . the story behind the event goes back to the third and fourth century ad .
saint nicholas - originally known as nikolaos of myra - was a greek bishop .
he had a reputation for gift-giving , which is why he also became the model for santa claus .
he is also known as the patron saint of children . in germany , kids eagerly await nikolaus each year .
they traditionally put a boot outside the front door on the evening of december 5 , expecting saint nicholas to fill it with gifts and sweets while they sleep .
this crucial part is usually performed by the parents , of course , but they like to make their children believe that saint nicholas rewards those who have been good and polite throughout the year . on the other hand , the german equivalent of santa claus - called weihnachtsmann -lrb- christmas man -rrb- - comes on christmas eve , along with the christkind -lrb- christ child -rrb- who is also a traditional gift-bringer in germany and other parts of central europe .
the figure of the christkind goes back to the times of martin luther , who , in line with his protestant teachings , discouraged the worship of saints , including saint nicholas . bildunterschrift : both nikolaus and santa claus were based on the same early christian saint results of the latest education study how good is the german education system ?
when the first pisa -lrb- programme for international student assessment -rrb- study came out in 2001 - a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school students ' scholastic performance - germany did not score particularly well .
the country 's media used terms like " pisa shock " to reflect the general disappointment . the study has been carried out every three years since then , with the latest results , due to be released on december 7 , focusing on reading abilities .
however , there is some controversy about how accurately the study really reflects the quality of an education system .
some critics point out that a student 's performance is influenced by many factors , and so it can not be explained by the quality of the school system alone . nevertheless , since the study came into existence , many are looking toward finland for guidance , as this northern european nation regularly scores excellent marks in pisa .
some believe that the german school system may be at fault after all .
the german tradition of dividing students into different types of high schools based on their academic performance has already been disputed and debated for quite some time .
and the pisa study only helps to fan the flames of this debate . big names on the big screen a much talked-about new movie by florian henckel von donnersmarck , " the tourist , " debuts in german movie theaters on december 16 .
the director won the academy award for best foreign language film in 2007 for his east-germany-based drama " the lives of others . " the film , which features hollywood stars angelina jolie and johnny depp in the main roles , is a thriller set in venice about an american tourist -lrb- depp -rrb- who is used by an english woman -lrb- jolie -rrb- in an attempt to mislead those following her criminal ex-lover . bildunterschrift : angelina jolie und johnny depp star in " the tourist " napoleon exhibition talking about your country 's history is not always easy - the germans know this all too well .
in the case of france , this problem relates to its former ruler and military leader napoleon bonaparte .
many french people are not proud of his imperialistic conquests and demonstrations of power , so it is not easy to organize an exhibition on the topic in his homeland , according to the spokesperson for the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany in bonn . from december 17 , the art and exhibition hall will host the exhibition " napoleon and europe .
dream and trauma , " which aims to explain who napoleon really was and how he rose to power .
items on display include original documents , paintings and everyday objects .
the exhibition 's curator is french scholar benedicte savoy , who teaches art history at the berlin institute of technology .
the exhibition will travel to france in march next year .
bildunterschrift : the exhibition features paintings depicting the life of napoleon , including battle scenes merry christmas and happy new year in germany , advent marks the countdown to christmas , which celebrates the birth of jesus christ .
during this time , an advent wreath decorates the tables in many german households .
this tradition can be traced back to johann hinrich wichern , a 19th-century german protestant pastor , who invented the wreath to make the advent time seem shorter for children , since they could light one candle in it each day . some theaters in germany offer a special advent program , where on each of the days between december 1 and december 24 -lrb- christmas eve -rrb- a little " door " is opened to reveal entertaining acts such as story-reading , dancing and music . and once christmas is over , it is soon time for new year 's eve .
as is customary on this special night , a large fireworks show will take place at the brandenburg gate in berlin to ring in 2011 when the clock strikes midnight . bildunterschrift : advent calendars were invented to contain children 's excitement ahead of christmas author : petra lambeck -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? # morewwwlinkstext # napoleon exhibition at bonn 's art and exhibition hall 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but the opposition thinks not everyone is benefitting from the boom . just in time for the christmas , it seems german consumers are rediscovering the joys of shopping .
speaking to the lower house of the german parliament on thursday , economics minister rainer bruederle said domestic demand was on the upswing and stronger than expected , as consumers were once again feeling comfortable enough to go out and spend .
" we 're consuming again , people are doing well and people are spending again , " said bruederle , calling the economic upswing like something " out of a fairy tale . "
germany 's gross domestic product is expected to grow by about 3.5 percent this year , nearing a two-decade high , and by 2.6 percent in 2011 .
bruederle said under the governing center-right coalition of the christian democrats and the liberal free democrats , germany has become the economic model for all of europe , adding that the country could expect to enjoy its current economic growth for the foreseeable future .
the market research firm gfk said consumer morale rose more than expected in november , for the sixth month in a row .
and german business sentiment rose to its strongest level since 1991 in november , according to the ifo economic think tank .
in october , unemployment fell to an 18-year low , dropping below three million for the first time since november 2008 .
bruederle is convinced that full employment could soon be a possibility , adding that in many regions in the south of the country this was already a reality .
opposition calls for wage increases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said germany had become the economic model for all of europe however , the opposition greens , social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and left party criticized bruederle 's comments , saying the economic boom was leaving the unemployed , retired and poor behind .
garrelt duin , of the spd , said the economic upswing was not stable or balanced .
he said both domestic investment and wages needed to increase , to support the increased domestic demand .
michael schlecht of the left party pointed out that while businesses were enjoying a growth in profits of up to 40 percent , wages had hardly followed suit .
he said that since 2000 , businesses had seen incomes increase by at least 50 percent , but the income of the average worker has actually dropped .
schlecht also said austerity programs in other european union countries , such as greece and ireland , would have a negative trickledown effect on german exports , on which germany has traditionally relied to support its growth .
he called for a reversal of the reforms to the “ hartz iv ” welfare subsidy program and for the introduction of a set minimum wage of 10 euros -lrb- $ 13.4 -rrb- per hour , to shore up the domestic growth sector .

his comments come ahead of a two-day visit to germany . russia is aiming for a free trade zone and a common industrial policy with the european union .
prime minister vladimir putin , writing in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung on thursday , said his goal was to create " a harmonious economic community from lisbon to vladivostok . "
cooperation between russia and the eu could even result in a free trade agreement or similar forms of economic integration eventually leading to a " common continental market . "
" we should be frank about it : the global economic crisis has revealed both russia and the eu to be economically very vulnerable , " putin wrote .
russia , he argued , was still too dependent on its energy exports , while the eu was in danger of jeopardizing its position on the international markets , due to a decrease in its industrial productivity .
" what 's on the agenda : how can we trigger a new wave of industrialization to roll across europe , " putin wrote .
different takes on energy cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' both russia and the eu have been shown to be economically very vulnerable ' : putin he suggested strategic alliances in key industries , including shipbuilding , car manufacturing , space exploration and the pharmaceutical industry .
energy policy , putin wrote , was another field where closer cooperation was needed .
from nuclear technology to gas and oil exploitation , there was a need for closer ties with brussels .
the european union gets around 25 percent of its natural gas from russia .
in the past , however , brussels has left little doubt that it wants to diversify its energy supply to reduce dependency on russia .
interruptions to the supply have in recent years lead to energy shortages in several eu member states .
putin also called for easing and eventually lifting visa restrictions between the eu and russia .
this , he wrote , would bring about not the end but rather the beginning of true integration between his country and the 27-nation bloc .
putin 's comments preceded his visit to germany , which starts on thursday .
he is scheduled to meet with german chancellor angela merkel on friday .
merkel , meanwhile , has downplayed the chances of a possible free trade zone .
speaking to reporters in berlin on thursday , she pointed to russian high tariffs and moscow 's trade relations with neighboring countries as potential stumbling blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas transit interruptions have led to tensions with moscow " of course we support the idea of a free trade zone between the eu and russia but i have to pour a bit of cold water on it , " she said .
" the steps that russia has taken recently do not point in that direction . "
she pointed out that russia , not yet part of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , has established trade ties with kazakhstan and belarus , countries whose statuses as potential wto members are far less certain than russia 's .
eon , gazprom on the agenda merkel and putin are also expected to discuss german energy company eon possibly selling its shares in russia 's gazprom .
media reports on wednesday suggested eon plans to drop the 3.5 percent stake it holds in the russian energy giant .
eon had dismissed reports that it would sell its 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- in shares , while a government spokesman in berlin confirmed the issue was on the agenda of the merkel-putin talks .
the eu is russia 's largest trading partner , making up about one half of its foreign trade .
total trade in the first half of the year was $ 141.9 billion -lrb- 106.3 billion euros -rrb- , according to the russian federal customs agency .

so-called " ghost estates " now blight the republic , with many homes left unoccupied or unfinished . ask a taxi driver in dublin to take you to a " ghost estate , " and a kind one will point out that you can walk there and do n't actually need a cab .
there are several examples of unfinished or largely unoccupied housing developments in the irish capital , one of which is called spencer dock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while there may be lots of housing , there are few real homes spencer dock 's developers say the project will be completed and residency rates will rise , but it is currently far emptier than they would like , and stationary cranes dot the landscape with unfinished buildings breaking the skyline . apart from the main road a street away , there is little activity - the sound of children playing outside is rarely heard , for example , according to those people who have taken up residence .
there is also a shiny new tram line , but very few people waiting to use it .
it is hard to find irish residents living in this development off the banks of the river liffey and just outside the center of dublin .
mikaela ekman moved here from sweden .
she acknowledged the strange atmosphere in the largely empty neighborhood .
" yeah , it 's very half finished ! " she said , laughing and pointing to the cranes around nearby buildings .
spencer dock 's developers have even had to launch legal action against customers who agreed to buy property on the site but have changed their mind in view of plummeting home values and low residency .
a problem not confined to dublin there are far too many buildings for people in ireland , according to brendan williams , a lecturer in urban development at university college dublin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williams says housing supply vastly outstrips demand " we estimate that the overproduction or oversupply in the housing area is approximately 17 percent ; in other areas , such as commercial and offices , it 's of the order of 20 percent , " he said .
" there is also an oversupply in other sectors as well , such as hotels . "
williams says construction continued at a rapid pace in the irish republic long after signs appeared that the economy was cooling , with disastrous effects for irish banks that invested heavily in the housing boom .
" in a general sense , there was an oversupply and an overbuilding that continued largely through the period 2004-2009 , which contributed , obviously , to the eventual failure of the property market . "
nearly 100,000 homes were built in 2006 alone .
williams said house prices have crashed by as much as 50 percent from their peak .
that has wiped billions of euros off the balance sheets of the banks .
what now for ghost estates ?
it 's not clear exactly how many homes are unoccupied across ireland .
some estimates put the figure as high as 300,000 .

but there 's another looming problem that could make such steps immaterial : with tens of thousands of people expected to leave ireland in the coming years because of its economic problems , excess supply in the housing market may yet worsen further .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 25.11.2010 majority of germans do not want their monarchy back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth is popular in germany , though the germans do n't want a queen of their own all of germany celebrated when the news broke of the upcoming royal wedding in england .
while germans follow their royal neighbors with great interest , a new poll shows they 're quite content without a monarchy . despite massive interest in the royal families of other european countries , 67 percent of the germans surveyed do n't want their own royal family back .
the poll was commissioned as a new wave of royal wedding fever sweeps the country with the recent engagement of prince william and kate middleton making the front pages of almost all daily newspapers and glossy magazines . yet despite this keen interest in the affairs of other countries ' royal families , the majority of germans are content to observe the ups and downs of royal life beyond their own borders without wishing for a return to the days when germany itself boasted a royal court .
content with status quo on the streets of berlin , the general opinion of passersby certainly confirmed the findings of the stern survey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william and kate 's engagement caused a blizzard of press interest " we certainly do n't need a monarchy , " said one woman , " and all this hullaballoo they are making in england about it , i find that rather difficult to comprehend . "
" for germany , it 's definitely not something we need , " said one man , " i 'm happy that we 're a republic with a solid constitution .
it 's enough for me to read about this kind of thing in the paper . "
" i read in the paper just how much the british monarchy costs the taxpayer , " explained one man , " and for that reason alone it 's something we should n't indulge in ourselves . "
" we do still have a royal house of sorts , " explained one young woman , " and -lsb- defense minister -rsb- karl-theodor zu guttenberg has kind of become an ersatz king if you like .
he has the name , the heritage , the popularity and represents that there is a need for this kind of person in germany . "
nearly a century ago germany 's monarchy was abolished in 1918 at the end of world war i and the abdication of kaiser wilhelm ii .
after giving up the german throne , he fled to the netherlands and spent the rest of his life there in relative obscurity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiser wilhelm ii , germany 's last emperor , held office from 1888-1918 while the kaiser 's descendants today are rarely mentioned in the german press , wilhelm 's crypt in huis doorn , netherlands , is an annual meeting place for a small but dedicated number of german monarchists who come together on the anniversary of his death on november 18 .
kaiser wilhelm ii 's involvement in world war i is arguably the reason why he is not glorified by germans today and why they seek their royal role models elsewhere .
the june wedding of victoria , crown princess of sweden to daniel westling was watched by a global audience of around 1 billion while the couple 's popularity in their home country soared with around 70 percent of swedes declaring their support for the monarchy .
since prince william and kate middleton 's engagement in kenya in october , germans have been keenly following the story and will no doubt be glued to the television when the couple ties the knot in 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.11.2010 eu welcomes irish austerity plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dublin hopes to reduce it 's deficit to three percent - down from 32 the european union says its confident about ireland 's proposed austerity measures .
yet financial markets remain nervous , fearing that spain and portugal may be next in line for eu aid . eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs olli rehn has applauded ireland 's 15-billion-euro -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- austerity package as " a sound basis for the negotiations " on an international bailout . ireland has set out a four-year plan to save the 15 billion euros in order to secure an international bailout expected to be in the region of 85 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts do not necessarily share olli rehn 's confidence under the national recovery plan , the irish republic aims to bring its budget deficit down from a projected 32 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to three percent of gdp by 2014 by imposing tax increases , wage cuts and by curbing public spending .
irish prime minister brian cowen conceded that the average living standard in his country was likely to suffer as a result of the severe cuts .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicholas sarkozy were said to be " impressed " with the recovery program , after discussing the situation in ireland by telephone on thursday .
a statement from the chancellor 's office added that both leaders " agreed that negotiations with the irish government must be rapidly concluded . " 85 billion - or more the drastic austerity measures are the condition for ireland to receive help from eu funds .
cowen has given 85 billion euros as the sum that his country would need , but negotiations with brussels and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- are still ongoing .
experts , however , warn that more money could be needed to avoid the former celtic tiger from sliding into bankruptcy .
constantin gurdgiev , an economist at trinity college in dublin , said the situation was even worse than in greece .
" our economy has more than three times more debt .
if greece is bankrupt - what then are we ? " he asked .
in the wake of the crisis in ireland international financial markets are getting increasingly nervous about portugal and spain .
both countries are feared to be the next possible candidates in need of an eu bailout .
" there 's nothing that politics can do to ease that tension on the markets , " lueder gerken , head of the center for european policy , told the neue rhein zeitung daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is expected by many to be the next eu country in need of help from brussels " of course there will be a domino effect - regardless of what 'll happen in ireland .
the markets have already set their eyes on portugal , and spain too looks to be set for trouble , " he added .
portugal , spain insist they wo n't be next herman van rompuy , head of the eu council , is trying to calm those concerns .
he said that any fears of a repeat of the irish crisis in portugal were baseless .
portugal 's debt was lower , there was n't a real estate crisis there , and the banks had enough capital reserves , van rompuy said .
" all that talk has neither an economic nor a rational basis . "
portuguese prime minister jose socrates also tried to reassure the public that his country would not need any eu help .
but his government 's plans for tough austerity measures have met with strong opposition , strikes and demonstrations - and a one-day general strike on tuesday .
spain , too , tried to dismiss fears that it would soon need eu aid .
" we are worlds apart from ireland , " deputy economics minister jose manual campa said .
unlike ireland , spain was a country with a comparatively low deficit and already in the process of consolidation , he added .
yet experts are somewhat less optimistic than madrid .
unemployment in spain has reached 20 percent , and economic growth is stagnating .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 25.11.2010 schalke 's confidence soars in europe while bremen plumbs new depths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could raul and schalke be about to take flight in europe ?
schalke 04 joined bayern munich in the last 16 of the champions league after a confident 3-0 win over lyon which hinted at a long-awaited return to form .
meanwhile , werder bremen continue to plumb the depths of despair . a team which had been struggling with a new faces and new tactics suddenly finds its feet in november , begins climbing the rungs in the bundesliga and marches in to the knockout stage of the champions league .
sound familiar ?
the story of bayern munich 's rise last season began , in some ways , like the unfolding tale of schalke 04 's campaign this time around .
bayern may never have flirted with the drop zone , but they began the season far off the pace .
right around the time christmas markets began opening up across the land , however , they found their rhythm - and built up the head of steam which carried them to their very successful end .
it remains fanciful to believe that schalke ’ s recent rampant form will be the start of a rise from the bottom to the top , resulting in schalke snatching the title in may , but it certainly appears - like bayern before them - that november is the month in which this schalke team began to click .
europe becomes schalke 's playground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huntelaar -lrb- m . -rrb- scored twice in schalke 's win over lyon schalke , in contrast to their wretched league from , have played well in europe nearly from the outset .
after a blip in their first group game at lyon , they have since won three and drawn one , a run of results which has seen them qualify for the knock-out rounds with a game to spare .
they could even go through as group winners .
wednesday night 's performance at home to lyon was the strongest indicator yet that schalke have turned a corner .
the team 's movement and one-touch passing was of such quality that it was hard to believe they were the same group that had sunk so desperately low in the bundesliga .
this was a truly european performance , with jefferson farfan and jose manuel jurado showing ingenuity and pace enough to rip the french defense to shreds .
raul , meanwhile , showed a growing belief in his new team , and klaas jan huntelaar 's rediscovered scoring touch can only bode well for the coming weeks .
schalke looked like they knew exactly what to do , and precisely what coach felix magath wanted from them .
even the royal blues ' defense , which has been shaky at best for most of the season , gave a commanding performance ; the much-maligned christoph metzelder and benedikt hoewedes in particular gave towering displays to cut out the threat from lyon 's ordinarily potent offense led by yoann gourcuff and lisandro lopez .
magath will now have confidence that his jigsaw is finally settling in place and that schalke can continue their climb out of the lower reaches of the bundesliga while progressing with flair in europe .
bremen in crisis as confidence goes awol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down and out : bremen 's loss to spurs ended their hopes werder bremen coach thomas schaaf has it worse - much worse .
taken apart by schalke last weekend in the league and dumped out of europe by tottenham hotspur on wednesday night , the north german club look destined to spend the remaining months of the season engaged in a fight for belief , if not survival , while felix magath 's side rub shoulders with the likes of barcelona , real madrid and manchester united .
bremen look such a broken team that it 's hard to see where any kind of recovery will come from .
the team werder sent out at white hart lane on wednesday was a mix of shell-shocked veterans and overwhelmed reserves who were getting a game only because of the team ’ s injury woes .
tottenham were 2-0 up at half time , but the way the beleaguered bremen squad left the pitch at the interval , they may as well have stayed in the locker room and taken the forfeit .
-lrb- the game did end 3-0 , as it happened . -rrb-
in the end , it did n't matter what the deficit was - werder were eliminated from the champions league .
moreover , they would need to beat european champions inter milan in their final group game , and make up a seven goal difference on fc twente to even have a chance of a place in the europa league place .
in other words , it ’ s not happening .
bremen have a north german derby on sunday against fc st. pauli which would usually be billed as a david and goliath clash .
on recent form though , it 's hard to say which is the skinny boy with the sling .
bremen 's response to dropping out of european competition for another season at home to pauli this weekend may determine their season .

now it barely glimmers in the history books .
however , author and journalist regine beyer , who has just published a new biography of stone entitled " abendkleid und filzstiefen " -lrb- " evening dress and felt boots " -rrb- , hopes her book will see a resurgence in popularity for this vibrant but overlooked singer .
" she was a very optimistic person and i mean optimism in this case as a source of life power , " said beyer , " she was very intelligent , she kept changing with the times , she connected a lot of different kinds of people and that is something that i aspire to as well . "
after more than a decade of weekly meetings gathering material for the book , beyer and stone became firm friends , although this developing affection between the two women did n't color the text which beyer ultimately published .
" i think as a journalist , i know how to keep the balance between journalism and a certain kind of empathy , " she pointed out , " i allowed her a lot of space to keep her spirit in the book . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone sisters : peggy stone -lrb- r -rrb- with best friend laelia rivlin life upset by war stone was born rosa goldstein in berlin in 1907 to german-jewish parents and shortly after her birth the family moved to bialystok in poland and from there to moscow where the young rosa studied piano .
after the 1917 revolution , mrs. goldstein fled russia with her three daughters and made her way back to berlin via bialystok , where the family was finally reunited with mr. goldstein in 1922 .
at the age of 12 , a love of singing and dance earned rosa the nickname peggy , partly due to her resemblance to the american child actress , peggy montgomery .
it was in weimar-era germany in the 1920s that peggy began her career as a performer .
she cut her teeth singing in cinemas , working as a chorus girl and appearing as a film extra .
her first flush of true success came in 1928 when , with her friend laelia rivilin , she founded the stone sisters .
two girls - each with a piano - performed a wild mix of jazz standards , ragtime , swing and popular german " schlager " music .
the duo 's career was guided by theater impressario kurt robitschek who secured bookings for the girls at important cabarets such as the tivoli , the trocadero and the moulin rouge .
the rise of nazism in germany forced peggy to flee the country in 1933 .
she settled in sweden and then russia where , with the czernowitzer jazz orchestra , she toured military bases and field hospitals entertaining russian servicemen .
at the end of world war ii , she was living in bucharest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author regine beyer spent 10 years interviewing peggy stone in new york new beginning in new york by the early 50s , peggy had re-located once again , this time to israel , but with few opportunities to perform available in the fledgling state , she packed her bags and moved for what would be the last time .
in 1953 , new york would become her permanent home but , by now in her late 40s , her career as a performer was over and she moved instead into the fashion industry working as a successful copyist .
it was here in the late 90s that author regine beyer met stone and began to record her life story , determined one day to turn it into a biography .
britta juergs from the aviva publishing house also fell for stone 's story and agreed to produce the book .
" maybe she 's not so famous , but she 's such an interesting woman , " she said , " in the book we have lots of original peggy .
there are parts of regine and there are parts of peggy stone and i think that 's really great to hear her because she had lots and lots of humor and it 's great to read . "
despite her contribution to the entertainment world and widespread popularity in her day , peggy stone has faded into relative obscurity ; partly because she was n't political or ground-breaking and also because she was active at a time when women had fewer opportunities than men to be recorded and preserved for posterity .
in 10 years of researching her subject , regine beyer was unable to unearth a single professional audio recording of peggy stone performing .
a natural optimist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyer 's new biography of stone now , the public has an opportunity to rediscover the world of peggy stone and her biographer and friend regine beyer wants them to remember her " as a woman who lived through very difficult times , who complained very little , who stood up to the reality , who tried to live her life the best she could and who also had a real great knack for putting people in touch from very different backgrounds . "
" she was a people 's person and she was always believing in life and that 's a great message , " added beyer .

but critics say the plan misses the point and burdens domestic companies instead . as online advertising continues to grow rapidly throughout europe , french senators this week approved a new tax law aimed at securing the government to a piece of the revenue pie .
although the measure is popularly known as the " google tax " , it does not directly impact the internet giant , which has based its advertising business offshore and out of reach of french tax collectors .
instead , the one-percent charge will be levied on all french-based companies purchasing online publicity services .
the measure is expected to become law in 2011 and generate between 10 and 20 million euros per year if it is passed by the national assembly , as predicted .
supporters of the tax say it will put online advertising on an equality footing with other media .
broadcast and print advertisements are already subject to taxation in france .
television advertising alone pumps roughly 70 million euros into government coffers annually .
but critics say the government 's plan fails to meet its original goal : to tax the french operations of internet giants such as google , microsoft , ebay and amazon , which are located strategically in european countries with low corporate tax rates , such as ireland and luxembourg .
french business leaders fear the measure will burden small advertisers and lead to an exodus of larger internet stakeholders from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original goal of the levy was to tax offshore internet giants ' profits according to iab europe – an umbrella organization representing national trade associations for digital and interactive marketing – france 's online advertising market is europe 's third largest after the united kingdom and germany .
in 2009 , the uk market was worth 4 billion euros , the german market worth 3 billion , and the french market worth 1.7 billion .
kimon zorbas , vice president of iab europe , says the proposed law is shortsighted in that it hits french companies while giving their foreign competitors a break .
" our position is that this is a market which is already less than half the size of the english market .
france has a lot of catching up to do , and such a tax on a developing market is doubly negative , " he told deutsche welle .
" any tax is bound to have an effect on the market .
naturally the question now is how big of an effect , and that 's something we ca n't yet know . "
pattern of intervention recently , a distinctly french approach to the economic and cultural challenges presented by the internet has emerged .
in october the country announced a subsidy system under which young people can buy partially subsidized cards to purchase and download music with .
the program is intended to encourage the legal downloading of music over internet piracy .
it has also begun to send piracy warnings via email to illegal file sharers .
and in november france extended its 1981 lang law – which lets publishers set book prices and forbids booksellers from giving more than a 5 percent discount – to apply to e-books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy 's government has been grappling with internet issues karin von abrams , a london-based analyst for emarketer , tracks the french market and says that while governments are generally " very wary of hindering " the growth of online markets , it 's not surprising that france would seek to tax them .
" france has a history of very deliberate federal supervision of – and sometimes intervention in – the media , " she told deutsche welle .
" they also have a very strong history of federal subsidies for culture … they see inequalities developing , and are perhaps more likely to intervene because of their historical attitudes in this respect . "
zorbas added that specialized national taxes could create disunity among european nations trying to increase their combined market share , and that attempts to create boundaries in the internet " just ca n't work out . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 25.11.2010 france plans to introduce new ' google tax ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris thinks google could contribute more to french coffers the french senate has approved a new tax on online advertising services offered by internet giants such as google .
but critics say the plan misses the point and burdens domestic companies instead . as online advertising continues to grow rapidly throughout europe , french senators this week approved a new tax law aimed at securing the government to a piece of the revenue pie .
although the measure is popularly known as the " google tax " , it does not directly impact the internet giant , which has based its advertising business offshore and out of reach of french tax collectors .
instead , the one-percent charge will be levied on all french-based companies purchasing online publicity services .
the measure is expected to become law in 2011 and generate between 10 and 20 million euros per year if it is passed by the national assembly , as predicted .
supporters of the tax say it will put online advertising on an equality footing with other media .
broadcast and print advertisements are already subject to taxation in france .
television advertising alone pumps roughly 70 million euros into government coffers annually .
but critics say the government 's plan fails to meet its original goal : to tax the french operations of internet giants such as google , microsoft , ebay and amazon , which are located strategically in european countries with low corporate tax rates , such as ireland and luxembourg .
french business leaders fear the measure will burden small advertisers and lead to an exodus of larger internet stakeholders from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original goal of the levy was to tax offshore internet giants ' profits according to iab europe – an umbrella organization representing national trade associations for digital and interactive marketing – france 's online advertising market is europe 's third largest after the united kingdom and germany .
in 2009 , the uk market was worth 4 billion euros , the german market worth 3 billion , and the french market worth 1.7 billion .
kimon zorbas , vice president of iab europe , says the proposed law is shortsighted in that it hits french companies while giving their foreign competitors a break .
" our position is that this is a market which is already less than half the size of the english market .
france has a lot of catching up to do , and such a tax on a developing market is doubly negative , " he told deutsche welle .
" any tax is bound to have an effect on the market .
naturally the question now is how big of an effect , and that 's something we ca n't yet know . "
pattern of intervention recently , a distinctly french approach to the economic and cultural challenges presented by the internet has emerged .
in october the country announced a subsidy system under which young people can buy partially subsidized cards to purchase and download music with .
the program is intended to encourage the legal downloading of music over internet piracy .
it has also begun to send piracy warnings via email to illegal file sharers .
and in november france extended its 1981 lang law – which lets publishers set book prices and forbids booksellers from giving more than a 5 percent discount – to apply to e-books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy 's government has been grappling with internet issues karin von abrams , a london-based analyst for emarketer , tracks the french market and says that while governments are generally " very wary of hindering " the growth of online markets , it 's not surprising that france would seek to tax them .
" france has a history of very deliberate federal supervision of – and sometimes intervention in – the media , " she told deutsche welle .
" they also have a very strong history of federal subsidies for culture … they see inequalities developing , and are perhaps more likely to intervene because of their historical attitudes in this respect . "
zorbas added that specialized national taxes could create disunity among european nations trying to increase their combined market share , and that attempts to create boundaries in the internet " just ca n't work out . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.11.2010 eu welcomes irish austerity plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dublin hopes to reduce it 's deficit to three percent - down from 32 the european union says its confident about ireland 's proposed austerity measures .
yet financial markets remain nervous , fearing that spain and portugal may be next in line for eu aid . eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs olli rehn has applauded ireland 's 15-billion-euro -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- austerity package as " a sound basis for the negotiations " on an international bailout . ireland has set out a four-year plan to save the 15 billion euros in order to secure an international bailout expected to be in the region of 85 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts do not necessarily share olli rehn 's confidence under the national recovery plan , the irish republic aims to bring its budget deficit down from a projected 32 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to three percent of gdp by 2014 by imposing tax increases , wage cuts and by curbing public spending .
irish prime minister brian cowen conceded that the average living standard in his country was likely to suffer as a result of the severe cuts .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicholas sarkozy were said to be " impressed " with the recovery program , after discussing the situation in ireland by telephone on thursday .
a statement from the chancellor 's office added that both leaders " agreed that negotiations with the irish government must be rapidly concluded . " 85 billion - or more the drastic austerity measures are the condition for ireland to receive help from eu funds .
cowen has given 85 billion euros as the sum that his country would need , but negotiations with brussels and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- are still ongoing .
experts , however , warn that more money could be needed to avoid the former celtic tiger from sliding into bankruptcy .
constantin gurdgiev , an economist at trinity college in dublin , said the situation was even worse than in greece .
" our economy has more than three times more debt .
if greece is bankrupt - what then are we ? " he asked .
in the wake of the crisis in ireland international financial markets are getting increasingly nervous about portugal and spain .
both countries are feared to be the next possible candidates in need of an eu bailout .
" there 's nothing that politics can do to ease that tension on the markets , " lueder gerken , head of the center for european policy , told the neue rhein zeitung daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is expected by many to be the next eu country in need of help from brussels " of course there will be a domino effect - regardless of what 'll happen in ireland .
the markets have already set their eyes on portugal , and spain too looks to be set for trouble , " he added .
portugal , spain insist they wo n't be next herman van rompuy , head of the eu council , is trying to calm those concerns .
he said that any fears of a repeat of the irish crisis in portugal were baseless .
portugal 's debt was lower , there was n't a real estate crisis there , and the banks had enough capital reserves , van rompuy said .
" all that talk has neither an economic nor a rational basis . "
portuguese prime minister jose socrates also tried to reassure the public that his country would not need any eu help .
but his government 's plans for tough austerity measures have met with strong opposition , strikes and demonstrations - and a one-day general strike on tuesday .
spain , too , tried to dismiss fears that it would soon need eu aid .
" we are worlds apart from ireland , " deputy economics minister jose manual campa said .
unlike ireland , spain was a country with a comparatively low deficit and already in the process of consolidation , he added .
yet experts are somewhat less optimistic than madrid .
unemployment in spain has reached 20 percent , and economic growth is stagnating .

there is also a shiny new tram line , but very few people waiting to use it .
it is hard to find irish residents living in this development off the banks of the river liffey and just outside the center of dublin .
mikaela ekman moved here from sweden .
she acknowledged the strange atmosphere in the largely empty neighborhood .
" yeah , it 's very half finished ! " she said , laughing and pointing to the cranes around nearby buildings .
spencer dock 's developers have even had to launch legal action against customers who agreed to buy property on the site but have changed their mind in view of plummeting home values and low residency .
a problem not confined to dublin there are far too many buildings for people in ireland , according to brendan williams , a lecturer in urban development at university college dublin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williams says housing supply vastly outstrips demand " we estimate that the overproduction or oversupply in the housing area is approximately 17 percent ; in other areas , such as commercial and offices , it 's of the order of 20 percent , " he said .
" there is also an oversupply in other sectors as well , such as hotels . "
williams says construction continued at a rapid pace in the irish republic long after signs appeared that the economy was cooling , with disastrous effects for irish banks that invested heavily in the housing boom .
" in a general sense , there was an oversupply and an overbuilding that continued largely through the period 2004-2009 , which contributed , obviously , to the eventual failure of the property market . "
nearly 100,000 homes were built in 2006 alone .
williams said house prices have crashed by as much as 50 percent from their peak .
that has wiped billions of euros off the balance sheets of the banks .
what now for ghost estates ?
it 's not clear exactly how many homes are unoccupied across ireland .
some estimates put the figure as high as 300,000 .
what is clear is that for the few residents who live in the ghost estates , life can be miserable .
some have such low occupancy rates that shopkeepers have declined to open in the area ; on some one side of the road is finished , while the other is not .

he has done so because rent is cheap , but admits there is a downside .
" i 've had my car broken into three times this year , " he said , acknowledging the problems with crime on estates where little pride is felt by residents for their unfinished surroundings .
steven sympathizes with those people who actually bought property where he lives .
" my heart goes out to working class families that have bought a home , and they open up their windows and they see a half-finished house across the road from them , " he said .

williams says that people need to acknowledge the realities of vast oversupply and start selling unoccupied properties in ghost estates at vastly knocked-down prices .
but there 's another looming problem that could make such steps immaterial : with tens of thousands of people expected to leave ireland in the coming years because of its economic problems , excess supply in the housing market may yet worsen further .

but the opposition thinks not everyone is benefitting from the boom . just in time for the christmas , it seems german consumers are rediscovering the joys of shopping .
speaking to the lower house of the german parliament on thursday , economics minister rainer bruederle said domestic demand was on the upswing and stronger than expected , as consumers were once again feeling comfortable enough to go out and spend .
" we 're consuming again , people are doing well and people are spending again , " said bruederle , calling the economic upswing like something " out of a fairy tale . "
germany 's gross domestic product is expected to grow by about 3.5 percent this year , nearing a two-decade high , and by 2.6 percent in 2011 .
bruederle said under the governing center-right coalition of the christian democrats and the liberal free democrats , germany has become the economic model for all of europe , adding that the country could expect to enjoy its current economic growth for the foreseeable future .
the market research firm gfk said consumer morale rose more than expected in november , for the sixth month in a row .
and german business sentiment rose to its strongest level since 1991 in november , according to the ifo economic think tank .
in october , unemployment fell to an 18-year low , dropping below three million for the first time since november 2008 .
bruederle is convinced that full employment could soon be a possibility , adding that in many regions in the south of the country this was already a reality .
opposition calls for wage increases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said germany had become the economic model for all of europe however , the opposition greens , social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and left party criticized bruederle 's comments , saying the economic boom was leaving the unemployed , retired and poor behind .
garrelt duin , of the spd , said the economic upswing was not stable or balanced .
he said both domestic investment and wages needed to increase , to support the increased domestic demand .
michael schlecht of the left party pointed out that while businesses were enjoying a growth in profits of up to 40 percent , wages had hardly followed suit .
he said that since 2000 , businesses had seen incomes increase by at least 50 percent , but the income of the average worker has actually dropped .
schlecht also said austerity programs in other european union countries , such as greece and ireland , would have a negative trickledown effect on german exports , on which germany has traditionally relied to support its growth .
he called for a reversal of the reforms to the “ hartz iv ” welfare subsidy program and for the introduction of a set minimum wage of 10 euros -lrb- $ 13.4 -rrb- per hour , to shore up the domestic growth sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 25.11.2010 december 2010 : dw 's culture calendar from music and art to film and dance - find out what 's going on in germany 's cultural scene .
deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . nikolaus is coming he may look similar to santa claus , but he is not quite the same thing .
in germany , saint nicholas - known as nikolaus - also has a white beard and carries a sack full of presents on his back , but he visits children in the wee hours of december 6 .
this date is not incidental , as december 6 is when people called nikolaus celebrate their name day in germany , in honor of the saint 's birthday . the story behind the event goes back to the third and fourth century ad .
saint nicholas - originally known as nikolaos of myra - was a greek bishop .
he had a reputation for gift-giving , which is why he also became the model for santa claus .
he is also known as the patron saint of children . in germany , kids eagerly await nikolaus each year .
they traditionally put a boot outside the front door on the evening of december 5 , expecting saint nicholas to fill it with gifts and sweets while they sleep .
this crucial part is usually performed by the parents , of course , but they like to make their children believe that saint nicholas rewards those who have been good and polite throughout the year . on the other hand , the german equivalent of santa claus - called weihnachtsmann -lrb- christmas man -rrb- - comes on christmas eve , along with the christkind -lrb- christ child -rrb- who is also a traditional gift-bringer in germany and other parts of central europe .
the figure of the christkind goes back to the times of martin luther , who , in line with his protestant teachings , discouraged the worship of saints , including saint nicholas . bildunterschrift : both nikolaus and santa claus were based on the same early christian saint results of the latest education study how good is the german education system ?
when the first pisa -lrb- programme for international student assessment -rrb- study came out in 2001 - a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school students ' scholastic performance - germany did not score particularly well .
the country 's media used terms like " pisa shock " to reflect the general disappointment . the study has been carried out every three years since then , with the latest results , due to be released on december 7 , focusing on reading abilities .
however , there is some controversy about how accurately the study really reflects the quality of an education system .
some critics point out that a student 's performance is influenced by many factors , and so it can not be explained by the quality of the school system alone . nevertheless , since the study came into existence , many are looking toward finland for guidance , as this northern european nation regularly scores excellent marks in pisa .
some believe that the german school system may be at fault after all .
the german tradition of dividing students into different types of high schools based on their academic performance has already been disputed and debated for quite some time .
and the pisa study only helps to fan the flames of this debate . big names on the big screen a much talked-about new movie by florian henckel von donnersmarck , " the tourist , " debuts in german movie theaters on december 16 .
the director won the academy award for best foreign language film in 2007 for his east-germany-based drama " the lives of others . " the film , which features hollywood stars angelina jolie and johnny depp in the main roles , is a thriller set in venice about an american tourist -lrb- depp -rrb- who is used by an english woman -lrb- jolie -rrb- in an attempt to mislead those following her criminal ex-lover . bildunterschrift : angelina jolie und johnny depp star in " the tourist " napoleon exhibition talking about your country 's history is not always easy - the germans know this all too well .
in the case of france , this problem relates to its former ruler and military leader napoleon bonaparte .
many french people are not proud of his imperialistic conquests and demonstrations of power , so it is not easy to organize an exhibition on the topic in his homeland , according to the spokesperson for the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany in bonn . from december 17 , the art and exhibition hall will host the exhibition " napoleon and europe .
dream and trauma , " which aims to explain who napoleon really was and how he rose to power .
items on display include original documents , paintings and everyday objects .
the exhibition 's curator is french scholar benedicte savoy , who teaches art history at the berlin institute of technology .
the exhibition will travel to france in march next year .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . nikolaus is coming he may look similar to santa claus , but he is not quite the same thing .
in germany , saint nicholas - known as nikolaus - also has a white beard and carries a sack full of presents on his back , but he visits children in the wee hours of december 6 .
this date is not incidental , as december 6 is when people called nikolaus celebrate their name day in germany , in honor of the saint 's birthday . the story behind the event goes back to the third and fourth century ad .
saint nicholas - originally known as nikolaos of myra - was a greek bishop .
he had a reputation for gift-giving , which is why he also became the model for santa claus .
he is also known as the patron saint of children . in germany , kids eagerly await nikolaus each year .
they traditionally put a boot outside the front door on the evening of december 5 , expecting saint nicholas to fill it with gifts and sweets while they sleep .
this crucial part is usually performed by the parents , of course , but they like to make their children believe that saint nicholas rewards those who have been good and polite throughout the year . on the other hand , the german equivalent of santa claus - called weihnachtsmann -lrb- christmas man -rrb- - comes on christmas eve , along with the christkind -lrb- christ child -rrb- who is also a traditional gift-bringer in germany and other parts of central europe .
the figure of the christkind goes back to the times of martin luther , who , in line with his protestant teachings , discouraged the worship of saints , including saint nicholas . bildunterschrift : both nikolaus and santa claus were based on the same early christian saint results of the latest education study how good is the german education system ?
when the first pisa -lrb- programme for international student assessment -rrb- study came out in 2001 - a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school students ' scholastic performance - germany did not score particularly well .
the country 's media used terms like " pisa shock " to reflect the general disappointment . the study has been carried out every three years since then , with the latest results , due to be released on december 7 , focusing on reading abilities .
however , there is some controversy about how accurately the study really reflects the quality of an education system .
some critics point out that a student 's performance is influenced by many factors , and so it can not be explained by the quality of the school system alone . nevertheless , since the study came into existence , many are looking toward finland for guidance , as this northern european nation regularly scores excellent marks in pisa .
some believe that the german school system may be at fault after all .
the german tradition of dividing students into different types of high schools based on their academic performance has already been disputed and debated for quite some time .
and the pisa study only helps to fan the flames of this debate . big names on the big screen a much talked-about new movie by florian henckel von donnersmarck , " the tourist , " debuts in german movie theaters on december 16 .
the director won the academy award for best foreign language film in 2007 for his east-germany-based drama " the lives of others . " the film , which features hollywood stars angelina jolie and johnny depp in the main roles , is a thriller set in venice about an american tourist -lrb- depp -rrb- who is used by an english woman -lrb- jolie -rrb- in an attempt to mislead those following her criminal ex-lover . bildunterschrift : angelina jolie und johnny depp star in " the tourist " napoleon exhibition talking about your country 's history is not always easy - the germans know this all too well .
in the case of france , this problem relates to its former ruler and military leader napoleon bonaparte .
many french people are not proud of his imperialistic conquests and demonstrations of power , so it is not easy to organize an exhibition on the topic in his homeland , according to the spokesperson for the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany in bonn . from december 17 , the art and exhibition hall will host the exhibition " napoleon and europe .
dream and trauma , " which aims to explain who napoleon really was and how he rose to power .
items on display include original documents , paintings and everyday objects .
the exhibition 's curator is french scholar benedicte savoy , who teaches art history at the berlin institute of technology .
the exhibition will travel to france in march next year .
bildunterschrift : the exhibition features paintings depicting the life of napoleon , including battle scenes merry christmas and happy new year in germany , advent marks the countdown to christmas , which celebrates the birth of jesus christ .
during this time , an advent wreath decorates the tables in many german households .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 25.11.2010 majority of germans do not want their monarchy back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth is popular in germany , though the germans do n't want a queen of their own all of germany celebrated when the news broke of the upcoming royal wedding in england .
while germans follow their royal neighbors with great interest , a new poll shows they 're quite content without a monarchy . despite massive interest in the royal families of other european countries , 67 percent of the germans surveyed do n't want their own royal family back .
the poll was commissioned as a new wave of royal wedding fever sweeps the country with the recent engagement of prince william and kate middleton making the front pages of almost all daily newspapers and glossy magazines . yet despite this keen interest in the affairs of other countries ' royal families , the majority of germans are content to observe the ups and downs of royal life beyond their own borders without wishing for a return to the days when germany itself boasted a royal court .
content with status quo on the streets of berlin , the general opinion of passersby certainly confirmed the findings of the stern survey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william and kate 's engagement caused a blizzard of press interest " we certainly do n't need a monarchy , " said one woman , " and all this hullaballoo they are making in england about it , i find that rather difficult to comprehend . "
" for germany , it 's definitely not something we need , " said one man , " i 'm happy that we 're a republic with a solid constitution .
it 's enough for me to read about this kind of thing in the paper . "
" i read in the paper just how much the british monarchy costs the taxpayer , " explained one man , " and for that reason alone it 's something we should n't indulge in ourselves . "
" we do still have a royal house of sorts , " explained one young woman , " and -lsb- defense minister -rsb- karl-theodor zu guttenberg has kind of become an ersatz king if you like .
he has the name , the heritage , the popularity and represents that there is a need for this kind of person in germany . "
nearly a century ago germany 's monarchy was abolished in 1918 at the end of world war i and the abdication of kaiser wilhelm ii .
after giving up the german throne , he fled to the netherlands and spent the rest of his life there in relative obscurity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiser wilhelm ii , germany 's last emperor , held office from 1888-1918 while the kaiser 's descendants today are rarely mentioned in the german press , wilhelm 's crypt in huis doorn , netherlands , is an annual meeting place for a small but dedicated number of german monarchists who come together on the anniversary of his death on november 18 .
kaiser wilhelm ii 's involvement in world war i is arguably the reason why he is not glorified by germans today and why they seek their royal role models elsewhere .
the june wedding of victoria , crown princess of sweden to daniel westling was watched by a global audience of around 1 billion while the couple 's popularity in their home country soared with around 70 percent of swedes declaring their support for the monarchy .
since prince william and kate middleton 's engagement in kenya in october , germans have been keenly following the story and will no doubt be glued to the television when the couple ties the knot in 2011 .

but critics say the plan misses the point and burdens domestic companies instead . as online advertising continues to grow rapidly throughout europe , french senators this week approved a new tax law aimed at securing the government to a piece of the revenue pie .
although the measure is popularly known as the " google tax " , it does not directly impact the internet giant , which has based its advertising business offshore and out of reach of french tax collectors .
instead , the one-percent charge will be levied on all french-based companies purchasing online publicity services .
the measure is expected to become law in 2011 and generate between 10 and 20 million euros per year if it is passed by the national assembly , as predicted .
supporters of the tax say it will put online advertising on an equality footing with other media .
broadcast and print advertisements are already subject to taxation in france .
television advertising alone pumps roughly 70 million euros into government coffers annually .
but critics say the government 's plan fails to meet its original goal : to tax the french operations of internet giants such as google , microsoft , ebay and amazon , which are located strategically in european countries with low corporate tax rates , such as ireland and luxembourg .
french business leaders fear the measure will burden small advertisers and lead to an exodus of larger internet stakeholders from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original goal of the levy was to tax offshore internet giants ' profits according to iab europe – an umbrella organization representing national trade associations for digital and interactive marketing – france 's online advertising market is europe 's third largest after the united kingdom and germany .
in 2009 , the uk market was worth 4 billion euros , the german market worth 3 billion , and the french market worth 1.7 billion .
kimon zorbas , vice president of iab europe , says the proposed law is shortsighted in that it hits french companies while giving their foreign competitors a break .
" our position is that this is a market which is already less than half the size of the english market .
france has a lot of catching up to do , and such a tax on a developing market is doubly negative , " he told deutsche welle .
" any tax is bound to have an effect on the market .
naturally the question now is how big of an effect , and that 's something we ca n't yet know . "

it has also begun to send piracy warnings via email to illegal file sharers .
and in november france extended its 1981 lang law – which lets publishers set book prices and forbids booksellers from giving more than a 5 percent discount – to apply to e-books .

" they also have a very strong history of federal subsidies for culture … they see inequalities developing , and are perhaps more likely to intervene because of their historical attitudes in this respect . "

this discovery could be used to develop better microchips for computers or more efficient solar energy technology , according to their research which was published in the journal nature on thursday .
bose-einstein condensates -lrb- bec -rrb- were first proposed in the 1920s by satyendra nath bose and albert einstein , who asserted that atoms , chilled to very near absolute zero , would take on quantum characteristics , so that the atoms " overlap , and behave as a giant meta-wave , " or a sort of super-atom , wherein a collection of atoms all act in concert , weitz told deutsche welle .
not everyone in the field of quantum optics is happy with the term super-atom or super-photon though , such as aephraim steinberg , a quantum physicist at the university of toronto .
" i find the word a little confusing and misleading , so i wouldn ’ t really want to call this a super photon , " steinberg said . within the bec there is still a collection of weakly interacting particles ; they don ’ t merge together to create a new molecule or new solid , but they take on an additional property that they all want to behave the same way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin weitz and his team worked on the experiment for three years " so it 's no more a super-atom than an army is a super person ; there may be ten thousand people marching in the same direction , but they 're not some sort of new creature , " steinberg said . the bec state was previously believed to apply only to atoms and not to photons , since the cooling process would force the photons to be absorbed by surrounding atoms in the apparatus . " if you cool down light , normally the light goes away , " weitz explained .
" if you turn off a light bulb then the filament cools down and it changes its color from yellow to red , as the number of photons is reduced , becoming dimmer and dimmer until they disappear entirely . " photons acting like atoms but now weitz , along with jan klaers , julian schmitt and frank vewinger , has managed to create a photonic bec at room temperature by trapping photons between two concave mirrors . the experiment also made use of liquid dye pigment that cooled the photons down to room temperature while they were trapped between the two mirrors .
when enough photons were pumped into this apparatus , a bec state was observed " which appeared as a yellow peak in the middle and there the photons marched in step , " weitz said . the discovery took three years of research and is being hailed as a major breakthrough in the field of quantum physics . matthias weidemueller , a quantum physicist at the university of freiburg , said in the journal nature that the experiment was " truly ingenious . " " compared to bose-einstein condensation with ultracold atoms , the current experiment is ridiculously simple , " he said . but some in the field maintain that , while the results are welcome and that the concept of a bec of photons was controversial , it 's not completely unexpected .
aephraim steinberg , a quantum physicist at the university of toronto , says quantum mechanics basically dictate that all bosons , a category which includes rubidium-87 atoms used in atomic bec , as well as photons , want to act in the same way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one potential application would be the creation of shortwave lasers " i think there 's been a lot of confusion and i think -lrb- this experiment -rrb- helps clarify some fundamental physics to see that , at a deep level , all particles are really the same , whether it ’ s a boson of light or a boson of rubidium , they really do have the same properties if you put them in the right circumstances , " steinberg said in a telephone interview . putting it to work weitz has a couple of ideas for applications resulting from the research at the university of bonn .
creating shortwave lasers in the x-ray or ultra-violet spectrum is one such idea . such shortwave lasers would be well-suited to the manufacture of computer chips as the process uses lasers to etch logic circuits onto semiconductor materials .
the precision of shortwave lasers is superior to those with longer wavelengths , which would allow chip designers to create more complex circuitry on the same area of silcon . another possible application using this apparatus , but with less light , weitz said , would be to concentrate the light for solar cells .
by placing the apparatus before a solar cell , " you could save a lot of money because you could use smaller solar cells but nevertheless , get all the light , " weitz said . weitz and his colleagues will now be focusing on learning more about the photonic bec they 've created , and also attempting to simplify the apparatus by switching out the liquid dye currently used , for a solid-state dye , which would require less equipment to manage . author : stuart tiffen editor : nicole goebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 25.11.2010 schalke 's confidence soars in europe while bremen plumbs new depths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could raul and schalke be about to take flight in europe ?
schalke 04 joined bayern munich in the last 16 of the champions league after a confident 3-0 win over lyon which hinted at a long-awaited return to form .
meanwhile , werder bremen continue to plumb the depths of despair . a team which had been struggling with a new faces and new tactics suddenly finds its feet in november , begins climbing the rungs in the bundesliga and marches in to the knockout stage of the champions league .
sound familiar ?
the story of bayern munich 's rise last season began , in some ways , like the unfolding tale of schalke 04 's campaign this time around .
bayern may never have flirted with the drop zone , but they began the season far off the pace .
right around the time christmas markets began opening up across the land , however , they found their rhythm - and built up the head of steam which carried them to their very successful end .
it remains fanciful to believe that schalke ’ s recent rampant form will be the start of a rise from the bottom to the top , resulting in schalke snatching the title in may , but it certainly appears - like bayern before them - that november is the month in which this schalke team began to click .
europe becomes schalke 's playground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huntelaar -lrb- m . -rrb- scored twice in schalke 's win over lyon schalke , in contrast to their wretched league from , have played well in europe nearly from the outset .
after a blip in their first group game at lyon , they have since won three and drawn one , a run of results which has seen them qualify for the knock-out rounds with a game to spare .
they could even go through as group winners .
wednesday night 's performance at home to lyon was the strongest indicator yet that schalke have turned a corner .
the team 's movement and one-touch passing was of such quality that it was hard to believe they were the same group that had sunk so desperately low in the bundesliga .
this was a truly european performance , with jefferson farfan and jose manuel jurado showing ingenuity and pace enough to rip the french defense to shreds .
raul , meanwhile , showed a growing belief in his new team , and klaas jan huntelaar 's rediscovered scoring touch can only bode well for the coming weeks .
schalke looked like they knew exactly what to do , and precisely what coach felix magath wanted from them .
even the royal blues ' defense , which has been shaky at best for most of the season , gave a commanding performance ; the much-maligned christoph metzelder and benedikt hoewedes in particular gave towering displays to cut out the threat from lyon 's ordinarily potent offense led by yoann gourcuff and lisandro lopez .
magath will now have confidence that his jigsaw is finally settling in place and that schalke can continue their climb out of the lower reaches of the bundesliga while progressing with flair in europe .
bremen in crisis as confidence goes awol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down and out : bremen 's loss to spurs ended their hopes werder bremen coach thomas schaaf has it worse - much worse .
taken apart by schalke last weekend in the league and dumped out of europe by tottenham hotspur on wednesday night , the north german club look destined to spend the remaining months of the season engaged in a fight for belief , if not survival , while felix magath 's side rub shoulders with the likes of barcelona , real madrid and manchester united .
bremen look such a broken team that it 's hard to see where any kind of recovery will come from .
the team werder sent out at white hart lane on wednesday was a mix of shell-shocked veterans and overwhelmed reserves who were getting a game only because of the team ’ s injury woes .
tottenham were 2-0 up at half time , but the way the beleaguered bremen squad left the pitch at the interval , they may as well have stayed in the locker room and taken the forfeit .
-lrb- the game did end 3-0 , as it happened . -rrb-
in the end , it did n't matter what the deficit was - werder were eliminated from the champions league .
moreover , they would need to beat european champions inter milan in their final group game , and make up a seven goal difference on fc twente to even have a chance of a place in the europa league place .
in other words , it ’ s not happening .
bremen have a north german derby on sunday against fc st. pauli which would usually be billed as a david and goliath clash .
on recent form though , it 's hard to say which is the skinny boy with the sling .
bremen 's response to dropping out of european competition for another season at home to pauli this weekend may determine their season .

schalke 04 joined bayern munich in the last 16 of the champions league after a confident 3-0 win over lyon which hinted at a long-awaited return to form .
meanwhile , werder bremen continue to plumb the depths of despair . a team which had been struggling with a new faces and new tactics suddenly finds its feet in november , begins climbing the rungs in the bundesliga and marches in to the knockout stage of the champions league .
sound familiar ?
the story of bayern munich 's rise last season began , in some ways , like the unfolding tale of schalke 04 's campaign this time around .
bayern may never have flirted with the drop zone , but they began the season far off the pace .
right around the time christmas markets began opening up across the land , however , they found their rhythm - and built up the head of steam which carried them to their very successful end .
it remains fanciful to believe that schalke ’ s recent rampant form will be the start of a rise from the bottom to the top , resulting in schalke snatching the title in may , but it certainly appears - like bayern before them - that november is the month in which this schalke team began to click .
europe becomes schalke 's playground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huntelaar -lrb- m . -rrb- scored twice in schalke 's win over lyon schalke , in contrast to their wretched league from , have played well in europe nearly from the outset .
after a blip in their first group game at lyon , they have since won three and drawn one , a run of results which has seen them qualify for the knock-out rounds with a game to spare .
they could even go through as group winners .
wednesday night 's performance at home to lyon was the strongest indicator yet that schalke have turned a corner .
the team 's movement and one-touch passing was of such quality that it was hard to believe they were the same group that had sunk so desperately low in the bundesliga .
this was a truly european performance , with jefferson farfan and jose manuel jurado showing ingenuity and pace enough to rip the french defense to shreds .
raul , meanwhile , showed a growing belief in his new team , and klaas jan huntelaar 's rediscovered scoring touch can only bode well for the coming weeks .
schalke looked like they knew exactly what to do , and precisely what coach felix magath wanted from them .
even the royal blues ' defense , which has been shaky at best for most of the season , gave a commanding performance ; the much-maligned christoph metzelder and benedikt hoewedes in particular gave towering displays to cut out the threat from lyon 's ordinarily potent offense led by yoann gourcuff and lisandro lopez .
magath will now have confidence that his jigsaw is finally settling in place and that schalke can continue their climb out of the lower reaches of the bundesliga while progressing with flair in europe .
bremen in crisis as confidence goes awol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down and out : bremen 's loss to spurs ended their hopes werder bremen coach thomas schaaf has it worse - much worse .
taken apart by schalke last weekend in the league and dumped out of europe by tottenham hotspur on wednesday night , the north german club look destined to spend the remaining months of the season engaged in a fight for belief , if not survival , while felix magath 's side rub shoulders with the likes of barcelona , real madrid and manchester united .
bremen look such a broken team that it 's hard to see where any kind of recovery will come from .
the team werder sent out at white hart lane on wednesday was a mix of shell-shocked veterans and overwhelmed reserves who were getting a game only because of the team ’ s injury woes .
tottenham were 2-0 up at half time , but the way the beleaguered bremen squad left the pitch at the interval , they may as well have stayed in the locker room and taken the forfeit .
-lrb- the game did end 3-0 , as it happened . -rrb-
in the end , it did n't matter what the deficit was - werder were eliminated from the champions league .
moreover , they would need to beat european champions inter milan in their final group game , and make up a seven goal difference on fc twente to even have a chance of a place in the europa league place .
in other words , it ’ s not happening .
bremen have a north german derby on sunday against fc st. pauli which would usually be billed as a david and goliath clash .
on recent form though , it 's hard to say which is the skinny boy with the sling .
bremen 's response to dropping out of european competition for another season at home to pauli this weekend may determine their season .

his comments come ahead of a two-day visit to germany . russia is aiming for a free trade zone and a common industrial policy with the european union .
prime minister vladimir putin , writing in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung on thursday , said his goal was to create " a harmonious economic community from lisbon to vladivostok . "
cooperation between russia and the eu could even result in a free trade agreement or similar forms of economic integration eventually leading to a " common continental market . "
" we should be frank about it : the global economic crisis has revealed both russia and the eu to be economically very vulnerable , " putin wrote .
russia , he argued , was still too dependent on its energy exports , while the eu was in danger of jeopardizing its position on the international markets , due to a decrease in its industrial productivity .
" what 's on the agenda : how can we trigger a new wave of industrialization to roll across europe , " putin wrote .
different takes on energy cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' both russia and the eu have been shown to be economically very vulnerable ' : putin he suggested strategic alliances in key industries , including shipbuilding , car manufacturing , space exploration and the pharmaceutical industry .
energy policy , putin wrote , was another field where closer cooperation was needed .
from nuclear technology to gas and oil exploitation , there was a need for closer ties with brussels .
the european union gets around 25 percent of its natural gas from russia .
in the past , however , brussels has left little doubt that it wants to diversify its energy supply to reduce dependency on russia .
interruptions to the supply have in recent years lead to energy shortages in several eu member states .
putin also called for easing and eventually lifting visa restrictions between the eu and russia .
this , he wrote , would bring about not the end but rather the beginning of true integration between his country and the 27-nation bloc .
putin 's comments preceded his visit to germany , which starts on thursday .
he is scheduled to meet with german chancellor angela merkel on friday .
merkel , meanwhile , has downplayed the chances of a possible free trade zone .
speaking to reporters in berlin on thursday , she pointed to russian high tariffs and moscow 's trade relations with neighboring countries as potential stumbling blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas transit interruptions have led to tensions with moscow " of course we support the idea of a free trade zone between the eu and russia but i have to pour a bit of cold water on it , " she said .
" the steps that russia has taken recently do not point in that direction . "
she pointed out that russia , not yet part of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , has established trade ties with kazakhstan and belarus , countries whose statuses as potential wto members are far less certain than russia 's .
eon , gazprom on the agenda merkel and putin are also expected to discuss german energy company eon possibly selling its shares in russia 's gazprom .
media reports on wednesday suggested eon plans to drop the 3.5 percent stake it holds in the russian energy giant .
eon had dismissed reports that it would sell its 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- in shares , while a government spokesman in berlin confirmed the issue was on the agenda of the merkel-putin talks .
the eu is russia 's largest trading partner , making up about one half of its foreign trade .
total trade in the first half of the year was $ 141.9 billion -lrb- 106.3 billion euros -rrb- , according to the russian federal customs agency .

but critics say the plan misses the point and burdens domestic companies instead . as online advertising continues to grow rapidly throughout europe , french senators this week approved a new tax law aimed at securing the government to a piece of the revenue pie .
although the measure is popularly known as the " google tax " , it does not directly impact the internet giant , which has based its advertising business offshore and out of reach of french tax collectors .
instead , the one-percent charge will be levied on all french-based companies purchasing online publicity services .
the measure is expected to become law in 2011 and generate between 10 and 20 million euros per year if it is passed by the national assembly , as predicted .
supporters of the tax say it will put online advertising on an equality footing with other media .
broadcast and print advertisements are already subject to taxation in france .
television advertising alone pumps roughly 70 million euros into government coffers annually .
but critics say the government 's plan fails to meet its original goal : to tax the french operations of internet giants such as google , microsoft , ebay and amazon , which are located strategically in european countries with low corporate tax rates , such as ireland and luxembourg .
french business leaders fear the measure will burden small advertisers and lead to an exodus of larger internet stakeholders from france .

kimon zorbas , vice president of iab europe , says the proposed law is shortsighted in that it hits french companies while giving their foreign competitors a break .
" our position is that this is a market which is already less than half the size of the english market .
france has a lot of catching up to do , and such a tax on a developing market is doubly negative , " he told deutsche welle .
" any tax is bound to have an effect on the market .

" they also have a very strong history of federal subsidies for culture … they see inequalities developing , and are perhaps more likely to intervene because of their historical attitudes in this respect . "
zorbas added that specialized national taxes could create disunity among european nations trying to increase their combined market share , and that attempts to create boundaries in the internet " just ca n't work out . "

zorbas added that specialized national taxes could create disunity among european nations trying to increase their combined market share , and that attempts to create boundaries in the internet " just ca n't work out . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 25.11.2010 eu welcomes irish austerity plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dublin hopes to reduce it 's deficit to three percent - down from 32 the european union says its confident about ireland 's proposed austerity measures .
yet financial markets remain nervous , fearing that spain and portugal may be next in line for eu aid . eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs olli rehn has applauded ireland 's 15-billion-euro -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- austerity package as " a sound basis for the negotiations " on an international bailout . ireland has set out a four-year plan to save the 15 billion euros in order to secure an international bailout expected to be in the region of 85 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts do not necessarily share olli rehn 's confidence under the national recovery plan , the irish republic aims to bring its budget deficit down from a projected 32 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to three percent of gdp by 2014 by imposing tax increases , wage cuts and by curbing public spending .
irish prime minister brian cowen conceded that the average living standard in his country was likely to suffer as a result of the severe cuts .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicholas sarkozy were said to be " impressed " with the recovery program , after discussing the situation in ireland by telephone on thursday .
a statement from the chancellor 's office added that both leaders " agreed that negotiations with the irish government must be rapidly concluded . " 85 billion - or more the drastic austerity measures are the condition for ireland to receive help from eu funds .
cowen has given 85 billion euros as the sum that his country would need , but negotiations with brussels and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- are still ongoing .
experts , however , warn that more money could be needed to avoid the former celtic tiger from sliding into bankruptcy .
constantin gurdgiev , an economist at trinity college in dublin , said the situation was even worse than in greece .
" our economy has more than three times more debt .
if greece is bankrupt - what then are we ? " he asked .
in the wake of the crisis in ireland international financial markets are getting increasingly nervous about portugal and spain .
both countries are feared to be the next possible candidates in need of an eu bailout .
" there 's nothing that politics can do to ease that tension on the markets , " lueder gerken , head of the center for european policy , told the neue rhein zeitung daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is expected by many to be the next eu country in need of help from brussels " of course there will be a domino effect - regardless of what 'll happen in ireland .
the markets have already set their eyes on portugal , and spain too looks to be set for trouble , " he added .
portugal , spain insist they wo n't be next herman van rompuy , head of the eu council , is trying to calm those concerns .
he said that any fears of a repeat of the irish crisis in portugal were baseless .
portugal 's debt was lower , there was n't a real estate crisis there , and the banks had enough capital reserves , van rompuy said .
" all that talk has neither an economic nor a rational basis . "
portuguese prime minister jose socrates also tried to reassure the public that his country would not need any eu help .
but his government 's plans for tough austerity measures have met with strong opposition , strikes and demonstrations - and a one-day general strike on tuesday .
spain , too , tried to dismiss fears that it would soon need eu aid .
" we are worlds apart from ireland , " deputy economics minister jose manual campa said .
unlike ireland , spain was a country with a comparatively low deficit and already in the process of consolidation , he added .
yet experts are somewhat less optimistic than madrid .
unemployment in spain has reached 20 percent , and economic growth is stagnating .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 25.11.2010 female genital mutilation is also an issue in europe , say activists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new campaign hopes to give fgm a top spot on the agendas of eu countries the european commission and ngos are calling on eu member states to support victims living within their borders and protect girls who are at risk of undergoing a practice that violates numerous human rights . practiced in africa as well as in certain countries in the middle east and communities in asia and latin america , female genital mutilation is the internationally-acknowledged name for the practice of cutting women 's genitalia .
girls are subjected to fgm for a variety of reasons , explained christine loudes , director of the endfgm campaign at amnesty international .
" fgm is performed for non-therapeutic reasons , " loudes said .
" it 's done in the name of tradition , in the name of aesthetics and sometimes in the name of religion . "
fgm involves partially or completely removing the external female genitalia , and the practice is usually performed under unhygienic conditions and without anaesthesia on girls from their birth to 15 years of age .
fgm represents a severe violation of human rights .
" it constitutes torture and degrading treatment ; it violates women 's rights , and it violates rights to physical integrity as well as to children 's rights , to name a few , " loudes added .
fgm crosses borders africa is the most notable perpetrator regarding fgm , with some 30 countries subjecting girls to the practice .
but girls are threatened by the practice on other continents as well .
according to the european parliament , roughly 500,000 girls and women in europe have already been subjected to fgm or are in danger of becoming victims .
that number includes 75,000 girls and women in the uk , 65,000 in france and 30,000 in germany .
as loudes explains , it 's difficult to prove that fgm is actually being carried out on the ground in europe , but amnesty international does not want to rule out the possibility .
" i can not say that it 's hard evidence .
there 's anecdotal evidence that this is done in europe and that actually there is a cross-border dimension to it , " loudes said .
" but mostly we know that it 's happening when girls are going with their parents on holiday to their parents ' country of origin , and that 's where they are most at risk . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fgm is usually carried out under unhygienic conditions and without anaesthesia one fgm victim living in europe is aissatou diallo , a native of guinea who was mutilated in her home country at the age of 14 .
fearing that her own daughters might meet the same fate , the family came to belgium in 2007 as refugees .
diallo says she now lives with a sense of security .
" i 've noticed that since coming to belgium i 've had peace of mind , because my children go to school and they are safe here , " diallo said .
" i do n't come home and ask , ‘ where are my girls ?
did someone take them away to cut them ? ' , which is what often happens in my country .
so here i 've been able to enjoy life again , and i 've learned to rebuild myself psychologically . "
diallo may have found her footing in belgium , but christine loudes says that the recovery process is long and demanding for fgm victims who arrive in europe .
" they need a lot of healthcare support , " she stressed .
" in particular , some form of reparation is required for women whose vagina has been stitched together .
these women will need to be unstitched and they will need psychological support because it 's a practice that brings a lot of psychological and physical trauma . "
support for victims and health professionals run by amnesty international in coordination with non-government organizations in 11 different european countries , the endfgm campaign has set accessible healthcare for fgm victims living in europe as a priority .
in germany , for example , there is still work to be done in achieving this goal .
" the treatment and the operations needed for fgm victims are not covered by health insurance here , " explained shewa sium , director of the cologne-based refugee support organization agisra .
" the women have to pay for it themselves .
right now , we 're collecting signatures for a petition so that medical treatment for victims of fgm can also be covered by insurance companies . "
but it 's not just the fgm victims who need support .
organizations like amnesty international and agisra are calling on eu member states to give government workers the resources and training they need to tackle an issue they are unlikely to have encountered before .
" we hear a lot of health professionals , teachers and social workers are confronted with the practice , and they do n't know how to deal with the situation , " said christine loudes .
" the most difficult moment is at the time of giving birth , during which there is a lot of risk for the mother and the baby .
the fact that health professionals are not used to dealing with women who have undergone fgm means that there is often an emergency caesarean section .
this leads to increased costs in the health system as well as a higher risk for the women . "
because fgm has a lifelong physical and psychological impact on its victims , organizations like amnesty international also emphasize the need to protect girls and women at risk , often via asylum in europe .
the european union , however , lacks unified procedures and legislation when it comes to fgm .
" what is problematic is that each member state has a very different approach in relation to fgm , " explains loudes .
" in some cases it is recognized as persecution , and in other cases you get another status that is less protective and is only temporary .
in some countries , the level of awareness is very low , in particular in the new countries that have joined the eu .
we are trying to change this by providing some education to asylum officers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls are usually subjected to fgm between infancy and 15 years of age eu countries must act , says commisssion in an effort to achieve a streamlined , forceful approach against fgm from eu member states , the european commission is also taking steps .
viviane reding , the justice and fundamental rights commissioner , has flagged fgm as an issue in a five-year strategy for equality between women and men , and the commission may further target fgm in a new policy paper due out in february 2011 .
" the commission is going to come out with a strategy policy paper on violence in general and victims .
fgm is one of the priorities for the commission , " said mathew newman , spokesperson for commissioner reding .
" it 's possible that we will include it in the victims ' strategy .
it 's a horrible practice , and people need to know that .
they also need to know that the european union is working with member states to raise awareness and doing everything we can to stop it . "
while the eu 's efforts are welcome news for women like aissatou diallo , she cautions that european countries and their citizens must also treat the issue of fgm with sensitivity to avoid stigmatizing its victims .
" when we talk about terrible things that others do n't understand , we simply need to tell them : it 's as if you would take a child in europe and cut off an ear , an arm , or an eye .
the child has been mutilated ; it 's as simple as that , " she explained .
" it 's true that we 're not seen as complete women .
we 're seen as handicapped , almost .
but we are people like you , and as africans , we are fighting for change .
our hope is to be the last women in the world who have suffered from this practice . "

his comments come ahead of a two-day visit to germany . russia is aiming for a free trade zone and a common industrial policy with the european union .
prime minister vladimir putin , writing in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung on thursday , said his goal was to create " a harmonious economic community from lisbon to vladivostok . "
cooperation between russia and the eu could even result in a free trade agreement or similar forms of economic integration eventually leading to a " common continental market . "
" we should be frank about it : the global economic crisis has revealed both russia and the eu to be economically very vulnerable , " putin wrote .
russia , he argued , was still too dependent on its energy exports , while the eu was in danger of jeopardizing its position on the international markets , due to a decrease in its industrial productivity .
" what 's on the agenda : how can we trigger a new wave of industrialization to roll across europe , " putin wrote .
different takes on energy cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' both russia and the eu have been shown to be economically very vulnerable ' : putin he suggested strategic alliances in key industries , including shipbuilding , car manufacturing , space exploration and the pharmaceutical industry .
energy policy , putin wrote , was another field where closer cooperation was needed .
from nuclear technology to gas and oil exploitation , there was a need for closer ties with brussels .
the european union gets around 25 percent of its natural gas from russia .
in the past , however , brussels has left little doubt that it wants to diversify its energy supply to reduce dependency on russia .
interruptions to the supply have in recent years lead to energy shortages in several eu member states .
putin also called for easing and eventually lifting visa restrictions between the eu and russia .
this , he wrote , would bring about not the end but rather the beginning of true integration between his country and the 27-nation bloc .
putin 's comments preceded his visit to germany , which starts on thursday .
he is scheduled to meet with german chancellor angela merkel on friday .
merkel , meanwhile , has downplayed the chances of a possible free trade zone .
speaking to reporters in berlin on thursday , she pointed to russian high tariffs and moscow 's trade relations with neighboring countries as potential stumbling blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas transit interruptions have led to tensions with moscow " of course we support the idea of a free trade zone between the eu and russia but i have to pour a bit of cold water on it , " she said .
" the steps that russia has taken recently do not point in that direction . "
she pointed out that russia , not yet part of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , has established trade ties with kazakhstan and belarus , countries whose statuses as potential wto members are far less certain than russia 's .
eon , gazprom on the agenda merkel and putin are also expected to discuss german energy company eon possibly selling its shares in russia 's gazprom .
media reports on wednesday suggested eon plans to drop the 3.5 percent stake it holds in the russian energy giant .
eon had dismissed reports that it would sell its 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- in shares , while a government spokesman in berlin confirmed the issue was on the agenda of the merkel-putin talks .
the eu is russia 's largest trading partner , making up about one half of its foreign trade .
total trade in the first half of the year was $ 141.9 billion -lrb- 106.3 billion euros -rrb- , according to the russian federal customs agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 25.11.2010 schalke 's confidence soars in europe while bremen plumbs new depths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could raul and schalke be about to take flight in europe ?
schalke 04 joined bayern munich in the last 16 of the champions league after a confident 3-0 win over lyon which hinted at a long-awaited return to form .
meanwhile , werder bremen continue to plumb the depths of despair . a team which had been struggling with a new faces and new tactics suddenly finds its feet in november , begins climbing the rungs in the bundesliga and marches in to the knockout stage of the champions league .
sound familiar ?
the story of bayern munich 's rise last season began , in some ways , like the unfolding tale of schalke 04 's campaign this time around .
bayern may never have flirted with the drop zone , but they began the season far off the pace .
right around the time christmas markets began opening up across the land , however , they found their rhythm - and built up the head of steam which carried them to their very successful end .
it remains fanciful to believe that schalke ’ s recent rampant form will be the start of a rise from the bottom to the top , resulting in schalke snatching the title in may , but it certainly appears - like bayern before them - that november is the month in which this schalke team began to click .
europe becomes schalke 's playground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huntelaar -lrb- m . -rrb- scored twice in schalke 's win over lyon schalke , in contrast to their wretched league from , have played well in europe nearly from the outset .
after a blip in their first group game at lyon , they have since won three and drawn one , a run of results which has seen them qualify for the knock-out rounds with a game to spare .
they could even go through as group winners .
wednesday night 's performance at home to lyon was the strongest indicator yet that schalke have turned a corner .
the team 's movement and one-touch passing was of such quality that it was hard to believe they were the same group that had sunk so desperately low in the bundesliga .
this was a truly european performance , with jefferson farfan and jose manuel jurado showing ingenuity and pace enough to rip the french defense to shreds .
raul , meanwhile , showed a growing belief in his new team , and klaas jan huntelaar 's rediscovered scoring touch can only bode well for the coming weeks .
schalke looked like they knew exactly what to do , and precisely what coach felix magath wanted from them .
even the royal blues ' defense , which has been shaky at best for most of the season , gave a commanding performance ; the much-maligned christoph metzelder and benedikt hoewedes in particular gave towering displays to cut out the threat from lyon 's ordinarily potent offense led by yoann gourcuff and lisandro lopez .
magath will now have confidence that his jigsaw is finally settling in place and that schalke can continue their climb out of the lower reaches of the bundesliga while progressing with flair in europe .
bremen in crisis as confidence goes awol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down and out : bremen 's loss to spurs ended their hopes werder bremen coach thomas schaaf has it worse - much worse .
taken apart by schalke last weekend in the league and dumped out of europe by tottenham hotspur on wednesday night , the north german club look destined to spend the remaining months of the season engaged in a fight for belief , if not survival , while felix magath 's side rub shoulders with the likes of barcelona , real madrid and manchester united .
bremen look such a broken team that it 's hard to see where any kind of recovery will come from .
the team werder sent out at white hart lane on wednesday was a mix of shell-shocked veterans and overwhelmed reserves who were getting a game only because of the team ’ s injury woes .
tottenham were 2-0 up at half time , but the way the beleaguered bremen squad left the pitch at the interval , they may as well have stayed in the locker room and taken the forfeit .
-lrb- the game did end 3-0 , as it happened . -rrb-
in the end , it did n't matter what the deficit was - werder were eliminated from the champions league .
moreover , they would need to beat european champions inter milan in their final group game , and make up a seven goal difference on fc twente to even have a chance of a place in the europa league place .
in other words , it ’ s not happening .
bremen have a north german derby on sunday against fc st. pauli which would usually be billed as a david and goliath clash .
on recent form though , it 's hard to say which is the skinny boy with the sling .
bremen 's response to dropping out of european competition for another season at home to pauli this weekend may determine their season .

schalke 04 joined bayern munich in the last 16 of the champions league after a confident 3-0 win over lyon which hinted at a long-awaited return to form .
meanwhile , werder bremen continue to plumb the depths of despair . a team which had been struggling with a new faces and new tactics suddenly finds its feet in november , begins climbing the rungs in the bundesliga and marches in to the knockout stage of the champions league .
sound familiar ?
the story of bayern munich 's rise last season began , in some ways , like the unfolding tale of schalke 04 's campaign this time around .
bayern may never have flirted with the drop zone , but they began the season far off the pace .
right around the time christmas markets began opening up across the land , however , they found their rhythm - and built up the head of steam which carried them to their very successful end .
it remains fanciful to believe that schalke ’ s recent rampant form will be the start of a rise from the bottom to the top , resulting in schalke snatching the title in may , but it certainly appears - like bayern before them - that november is the month in which this schalke team began to click .
europe becomes schalke 's playground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huntelaar -lrb- m . -rrb- scored twice in schalke 's win over lyon schalke , in contrast to their wretched league from , have played well in europe nearly from the outset .
after a blip in their first group game at lyon , they have since won three and drawn one , a run of results which has seen them qualify for the knock-out rounds with a game to spare .
they could even go through as group winners .
wednesday night 's performance at home to lyon was the strongest indicator yet that schalke have turned a corner .
the team 's movement and one-touch passing was of such quality that it was hard to believe they were the same group that had sunk so desperately low in the bundesliga .
this was a truly european performance , with jefferson farfan and jose manuel jurado showing ingenuity and pace enough to rip the french defense to shreds .
raul , meanwhile , showed a growing belief in his new team , and klaas jan huntelaar 's rediscovered scoring touch can only bode well for the coming weeks .
schalke looked like they knew exactly what to do , and precisely what coach felix magath wanted from them .
even the royal blues ' defense , which has been shaky at best for most of the season , gave a commanding performance ; the much-maligned christoph metzelder and benedikt hoewedes in particular gave towering displays to cut out the threat from lyon 's ordinarily potent offense led by yoann gourcuff and lisandro lopez .
magath will now have confidence that his jigsaw is finally settling in place and that schalke can continue their climb out of the lower reaches of the bundesliga while progressing with flair in europe .
bremen in crisis as confidence goes awol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down and out : bremen 's loss to spurs ended their hopes werder bremen coach thomas schaaf has it worse - much worse .
taken apart by schalke last weekend in the league and dumped out of europe by tottenham hotspur on wednesday night , the north german club look destined to spend the remaining months of the season engaged in a fight for belief , if not survival , while felix magath 's side rub shoulders with the likes of barcelona , real madrid and manchester united .
bremen look such a broken team that it 's hard to see where any kind of recovery will come from .
the team werder sent out at white hart lane on wednesday was a mix of shell-shocked veterans and overwhelmed reserves who were getting a game only because of the team ’ s injury woes .
tottenham were 2-0 up at half time , but the way the beleaguered bremen squad left the pitch at the interval , they may as well have stayed in the locker room and taken the forfeit .
-lrb- the game did end 3-0 , as it happened . -rrb-
in the end , it did n't matter what the deficit was - werder were eliminated from the champions league .
moreover , they would need to beat european champions inter milan in their final group game , and make up a seven goal difference on fc twente to even have a chance of a place in the europa league place .
in other words , it ’ s not happening .
bremen have a north german derby on sunday against fc st. pauli which would usually be billed as a david and goliath clash .
on recent form though , it 's hard to say which is the skinny boy with the sling .
bremen 's response to dropping out of european competition for another season at home to pauli this weekend may determine their season .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . nikolaus is coming he may look similar to santa claus , but he is not quite the same thing .
in germany , saint nicholas - known as nikolaus - also has a white beard and carries a sack full of presents on his back , but he visits children in the wee hours of december 6 .
this date is not incidental , as december 6 is when people called nikolaus celebrate their name day in germany , in honor of the saint 's birthday . the story behind the event goes back to the third and fourth century ad .
saint nicholas - originally known as nikolaos of myra - was a greek bishop .
he had a reputation for gift-giving , which is why he also became the model for santa claus .
he is also known as the patron saint of children . in germany , kids eagerly await nikolaus each year .
they traditionally put a boot outside the front door on the evening of december 5 , expecting saint nicholas to fill it with gifts and sweets while they sleep .
this crucial part is usually performed by the parents , of course , but they like to make their children believe that saint nicholas rewards those who have been good and polite throughout the year . on the other hand , the german equivalent of santa claus - called weihnachtsmann -lrb- christmas man -rrb- - comes on christmas eve , along with the christkind -lrb- christ child -rrb- who is also a traditional gift-bringer in germany and other parts of central europe .
the figure of the christkind goes back to the times of martin luther , who , in line with his protestant teachings , discouraged the worship of saints , including saint nicholas . bildunterschrift : both nikolaus and santa claus were based on the same early christian saint results of the latest education study how good is the german education system ?
when the first pisa -lrb- programme for international student assessment -rrb- study came out in 2001 - a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school students ' scholastic performance - germany did not score particularly well .
the country 's media used terms like " pisa shock " to reflect the general disappointment . the study has been carried out every three years since then , with the latest results , due to be released on december 7 , focusing on reading abilities .
however , there is some controversy about how accurately the study really reflects the quality of an education system .
some critics point out that a student 's performance is influenced by many factors , and so it can not be explained by the quality of the school system alone . nevertheless , since the study came into existence , many are looking toward finland for guidance , as this northern european nation regularly scores excellent marks in pisa .
some believe that the german school system may be at fault after all .
the german tradition of dividing students into different types of high schools based on their academic performance has already been disputed and debated for quite some time .
and the pisa study only helps to fan the flames of this debate . big names on the big screen a much talked-about new movie by florian henckel von donnersmarck , " the tourist , " debuts in german movie theaters on december 16 .
the director won the academy award for best foreign language film in 2007 for his east-germany-based drama " the lives of others . " the film , which features hollywood stars angelina jolie and johnny depp in the main roles , is a thriller set in venice about an american tourist -lrb- depp -rrb- who is used by an english woman -lrb- jolie -rrb- in an attempt to mislead those following her criminal ex-lover . bildunterschrift : angelina jolie und johnny depp star in " the tourist " napoleon exhibition talking about your country 's history is not always easy - the germans know this all too well .
in the case of france , this problem relates to its former ruler and military leader napoleon bonaparte .
many french people are not proud of his imperialistic conquests and demonstrations of power , so it is not easy to organize an exhibition on the topic in his homeland , according to the spokesperson for the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany in bonn . from december 17 , the art and exhibition hall will host the exhibition " napoleon and europe .
dream and trauma , " which aims to explain who napoleon really was and how he rose to power .
items on display include original documents , paintings and everyday objects .
the exhibition 's curator is french scholar benedicte savoy , who teaches art history at the berlin institute of technology .
the exhibition will travel to france in march next year .
bildunterschrift : the exhibition features paintings depicting the life of napoleon , including battle scenes merry christmas and happy new year in germany , advent marks the countdown to christmas , which celebrates the birth of jesus christ .
during this time , an advent wreath decorates the tables in many german households .
this tradition can be traced back to johann hinrich wichern , a 19th-century german protestant pastor , who invented the wreath to make the advent time seem shorter for children , since they could light one candle in it each day . some theaters in germany offer a special advent program , where on each of the days between december 1 and december 24 -lrb- christmas eve -rrb- a little " door " is opened to reveal entertaining acts such as story-reading , dancing and music . and once christmas is over , it is soon time for new year 's eve .
as is customary on this special night , a large fireworks show will take place at the brandenburg gate in berlin to ring in 2011 when the clock strikes midnight . bildunterschrift : advent calendars were invented to contain children 's excitement ahead of christmas author : petra lambeck -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? # morewwwlinkstext # napoleon exhibition at bonn 's art and exhibition hall 02 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

29 and 30 .
until now , only a few limited deals - so-called economic partnership agreements - have been made between the eu and select acp nations .
while the eu and the acp group of nations have had a common free-trade agreement since 2002 , so far , that agreement has done little for africa , according to ngos like oxfam , misereor and the german church development group , evangelischer entwicklungsdienst .
and according to these groups , the blame lies entirely with europe .
skepticism , hope ahead of meeting now , the african nations are demanding that 80 percent of all tariffs on imported goods be abolished .
at the same time , they want the export of raw materials to be restricted .
for its part , the european union is pressing for free-trade for services . african countries would have little hope of being able to export services themselves , since the service industry is far less expansive there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxfam is one of the groups calling for change after years of unsuccessful negotiations , oxfam trade policy advisor david hachfeld said he is sceptical about the chances that next week ’ s summit will bring the two continents onto the same page .
and he is worried that individual countries may decide to take unilateral action .
" if most of the countries in a particular region want to refuse services , but one or two countries in that region want the services , then the european union is prepared to keep working with those one or two countries , " hachfield said .
" that would be devastating in my opinion , and i hope the african countries won ’ t let themselves be divided like that . "
but offah obale , a cameroonian consultant for the african union , is more optimistic .
he says the fact that 80 heads of state are expected to attend the tripoli summit make it a unique opportunity to resolve the trade dispute between the eu and africa at the highest political level .
warning on increased poverty " i think it will be hypocritical for african and european leaders to continue going to new york and talk about achieving millenium goals by 2015 and not talk about the major instrument , " obale said .
" so my major expectation in the area of trade is that the summit at the end of this month will come out with a consensus on the way forward with respect to economic partnership agreements . "
senegalese ndiaga mboub , who works with the world health organisation in geneva , switzerland , added that if nothing changes , trade policy between africa and the eu will only serve to increase poverty across africa .
more far-reaching change in african industry is needed to overcome what he described as a new kind of colonialism .
" the problem is that africa ca n't develop on its own , in that it exports raw materials and agricultural products to europe , " he said .
" not one single country is going to make any progress if it doesn ’ t develop its own industry .
it 's still the case that africa sends raw materials off to european factories where they 're processed further , for example in the oil industry . "
oxfam 's hachfeld said that he increasingly questions the eu 's africa strategy because other countries are already on the way to outpacing the eu in terms of striking trade deals .
" why should african countries be so reliant on the european union when they can see that the growth rates in trade with india , china , and brazil are three times as high as they are with the eu ? " he asks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some farmers in africa have suffered under increased eu exports poultry and dairy industries suffer african agriculture has suffered under the current trade imbalances .
for example , poultry breeding and processing in ghana has ground almost to a halt , because the eu has increased its exports to the country from almost 5,000 tons in 1998 to 90,000 tons in 2009 .
another example is dairy exports to africa , which rose by over 40 percent between 2005 and 2008 .
these jumps in eu exports might be good news for european farmers .
but german development groups have said they are coming at the expense of african farmers , and they want the situation to change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 25.11.2010 december 2010 : dw 's culture calendar from music and art to film and dance - find out what 's going on in germany 's cultural scene .
deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . nikolaus is coming he may look similar to santa claus , but he is not quite the same thing .
in germany , saint nicholas - known as nikolaus - also has a white beard and carries a sack full of presents on his back , but he visits children in the wee hours of december 6 .
this date is not incidental , as december 6 is when people called nikolaus celebrate their name day in germany , in honor of the saint 's birthday . the story behind the event goes back to the third and fourth century ad .
saint nicholas - originally known as nikolaos of myra - was a greek bishop .
he had a reputation for gift-giving , which is why he also became the model for santa claus .
he is also known as the patron saint of children . in germany , kids eagerly await nikolaus each year .
they traditionally put a boot outside the front door on the evening of december 5 , expecting saint nicholas to fill it with gifts and sweets while they sleep .
this crucial part is usually performed by the parents , of course , but they like to make their children believe that saint nicholas rewards those who have been good and polite throughout the year . on the other hand , the german equivalent of santa claus - called weihnachtsmann -lrb- christmas man -rrb- - comes on christmas eve , along with the christkind -lrb- christ child -rrb- who is also a traditional gift-bringer in germany and other parts of central europe .
the figure of the christkind goes back to the times of martin luther , who , in line with his protestant teachings , discouraged the worship of saints , including saint nicholas . bildunterschrift : both nikolaus and santa claus were based on the same early christian saint results of the latest education study how good is the german education system ?
when the first pisa -lrb- programme for international student assessment -rrb- study came out in 2001 - a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school students ' scholastic performance - germany did not score particularly well .
the country 's media used terms like " pisa shock " to reflect the general disappointment . the study has been carried out every three years since then , with the latest results , due to be released on december 7 , focusing on reading abilities .
however , there is some controversy about how accurately the study really reflects the quality of an education system .
some critics point out that a student 's performance is influenced by many factors , and so it can not be explained by the quality of the school system alone . nevertheless , since the study came into existence , many are looking toward finland for guidance , as this northern european nation regularly scores excellent marks in pisa .
some believe that the german school system may be at fault after all .
the german tradition of dividing students into different types of high schools based on their academic performance has already been disputed and debated for quite some time .
and the pisa study only helps to fan the flames of this debate . big names on the big screen a much talked-about new movie by florian henckel von donnersmarck , " the tourist , " debuts in german movie theaters on december 16 .
the director won the academy award for best foreign language film in 2007 for his east-germany-based drama " the lives of others . " the film , which features hollywood stars angelina jolie and johnny depp in the main roles , is a thriller set in venice about an american tourist -lrb- depp -rrb- who is used by an english woman -lrb- jolie -rrb- in an attempt to mislead those following her criminal ex-lover . bildunterschrift : angelina jolie und johnny depp star in " the tourist " napoleon exhibition talking about your country 's history is not always easy - the germans know this all too well .
in the case of france , this problem relates to its former ruler and military leader napoleon bonaparte .
many french people are not proud of his imperialistic conquests and demonstrations of power , so it is not easy to organize an exhibition on the topic in his homeland , according to the spokesperson for the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany in bonn . from december 17 , the art and exhibition hall will host the exhibition " napoleon and europe .
dream and trauma , " which aims to explain who napoleon really was and how he rose to power .
items on display include original documents , paintings and everyday objects .
the exhibition 's curator is french scholar benedicte savoy , who teaches art history at the berlin institute of technology .
the exhibition will travel to france in march next year .
bildunterschrift : the exhibition features paintings depicting the life of napoleon , including battle scenes merry christmas and happy new year in germany , advent marks the countdown to christmas , which celebrates the birth of jesus christ .

schalke 04 joined bayern munich in the last 16 of the champions league after a confident 3-0 win over lyon which hinted at a long-awaited return to form .

bayern may never have flirted with the drop zone , but they began the season far off the pace .
right around the time christmas markets began opening up across the land , however , they found their rhythm - and built up the head of steam which carried them to their very successful end .
it remains fanciful to believe that schalke ’ s recent rampant form will be the start of a rise from the bottom to the top , resulting in schalke snatching the title in may , but it certainly appears - like bayern before them - that november is the month in which this schalke team began to click .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de research -pipe- 25.11.2010 german scientists create ' super-photon ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by cooling and trapping light , scientists made a super-photon scientists in germany have disproven assumptions that creating a " super-photon " was impossible , by finding a solution with a comparatively simple experiment . a team of physicists , lead by the university of bonn 's martin weitz , have managed to create a bose-einstein condensate out of photons , or particles of light .
this discovery could be used to develop better microchips for computers or more efficient solar energy technology , according to their research which was published in the journal nature on thursday .
bose-einstein condensates -lrb- bec -rrb- were first proposed in the 1920s by satyendra nath bose and albert einstein , who asserted that atoms , chilled to very near absolute zero , would take on quantum characteristics , so that the atoms " overlap , and behave as a giant meta-wave , " or a sort of super-atom , wherein a collection of atoms all act in concert , weitz told deutsche welle .
not everyone in the field of quantum optics is happy with the term super-atom or super-photon though , such as aephraim steinberg , a quantum physicist at the university of toronto .
" i find the word a little confusing and misleading , so i wouldn ’ t really want to call this a super photon , " steinberg said . within the bec there is still a collection of weakly interacting particles ; they don ’ t merge together to create a new molecule or new solid , but they take on an additional property that they all want to behave the same way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin weitz and his team worked on the experiment for three years " so it 's no more a super-atom than an army is a super person ; there may be ten thousand people marching in the same direction , but they 're not some sort of new creature , " steinberg said . the bec state was previously believed to apply only to atoms and not to photons , since the cooling process would force the photons to be absorbed by surrounding atoms in the apparatus . " if you cool down light , normally the light goes away , " weitz explained .
" if you turn off a light bulb then the filament cools down and it changes its color from yellow to red , as the number of photons is reduced , becoming dimmer and dimmer until they disappear entirely . " photons acting like atoms but now weitz , along with jan klaers , julian schmitt and frank vewinger , has managed to create a photonic bec at room temperature by trapping photons between two concave mirrors . the experiment also made use of liquid dye pigment that cooled the photons down to room temperature while they were trapped between the two mirrors .
when enough photons were pumped into this apparatus , a bec state was observed " which appeared as a yellow peak in the middle and there the photons marched in step , " weitz said . the discovery took three years of research and is being hailed as a major breakthrough in the field of quantum physics . matthias weidemueller , a quantum physicist at the university of freiburg , said in the journal nature that the experiment was " truly ingenious . " " compared to bose-einstein condensation with ultracold atoms , the current experiment is ridiculously simple , " he said . but some in the field maintain that , while the results are welcome and that the concept of a bec of photons was controversial , it 's not completely unexpected .
aephraim steinberg , a quantum physicist at the university of toronto , says quantum mechanics basically dictate that all bosons , a category which includes rubidium-87 atoms used in atomic bec , as well as photons , want to act in the same way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one potential application would be the creation of shortwave lasers " i think there 's been a lot of confusion and i think -lrb- this experiment -rrb- helps clarify some fundamental physics to see that , at a deep level , all particles are really the same , whether it ’ s a boson of light or a boson of rubidium , they really do have the same properties if you put them in the right circumstances , " steinberg said in a telephone interview . putting it to work weitz has a couple of ideas for applications resulting from the research at the university of bonn .
creating shortwave lasers in the x-ray or ultra-violet spectrum is one such idea . such shortwave lasers would be well-suited to the manufacture of computer chips as the process uses lasers to etch logic circuits onto semiconductor materials .
the precision of shortwave lasers is superior to those with longer wavelengths , which would allow chip designers to create more complex circuitry on the same area of silcon . another possible application using this apparatus , but with less light , weitz said , would be to concentrate the light for solar cells .
by placing the apparatus before a solar cell , " you could save a lot of money because you could use smaller solar cells but nevertheless , get all the light , " weitz said . weitz and his colleagues will now be focusing on learning more about the photonic bec they 've created , and also attempting to simplify the apparatus by switching out the liquid dye currently used , for a solid-state dye , which would require less equipment to manage . author : stuart tiffen editor : nicole goebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 25.11.2010 december 2010 : dw 's culture calendar from music and art to film and dance - find out what 's going on in germany 's cultural scene .
deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . nikolaus is coming he may look similar to santa claus , but he is not quite the same thing .
in germany , saint nicholas - known as nikolaus - also has a white beard and carries a sack full of presents on his back , but he visits children in the wee hours of december 6 .
this date is not incidental , as december 6 is when people called nikolaus celebrate their name day in germany , in honor of the saint 's birthday . the story behind the event goes back to the third and fourth century ad .
saint nicholas - originally known as nikolaos of myra - was a greek bishop .
he had a reputation for gift-giving , which is why he also became the model for santa claus .
he is also known as the patron saint of children . in germany , kids eagerly await nikolaus each year .
they traditionally put a boot outside the front door on the evening of december 5 , expecting saint nicholas to fill it with gifts and sweets while they sleep .
this crucial part is usually performed by the parents , of course , but they like to make their children believe that saint nicholas rewards those who have been good and polite throughout the year . on the other hand , the german equivalent of santa claus - called weihnachtsmann -lrb- christmas man -rrb- - comes on christmas eve , along with the christkind -lrb- christ child -rrb- who is also a traditional gift-bringer in germany and other parts of central europe .
the figure of the christkind goes back to the times of martin luther , who , in line with his protestant teachings , discouraged the worship of saints , including saint nicholas . bildunterschrift : both nikolaus and santa claus were based on the same early christian saint results of the latest education study how good is the german education system ?
when the first pisa -lrb- programme for international student assessment -rrb- study came out in 2001 - a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school students ' scholastic performance - germany did not score particularly well .
the country 's media used terms like " pisa shock " to reflect the general disappointment . the study has been carried out every three years since then , with the latest results , due to be released on december 7 , focusing on reading abilities .
however , there is some controversy about how accurately the study really reflects the quality of an education system .
some critics point out that a student 's performance is influenced by many factors , and so it can not be explained by the quality of the school system alone . nevertheless , since the study came into existence , many are looking toward finland for guidance , as this northern european nation regularly scores excellent marks in pisa .
some believe that the german school system may be at fault after all .
the german tradition of dividing students into different types of high schools based on their academic performance has already been disputed and debated for quite some time .
and the pisa study only helps to fan the flames of this debate . big names on the big screen a much talked-about new movie by florian henckel von donnersmarck , " the tourist , " debuts in german movie theaters on december 16 .
the director won the academy award for best foreign language film in 2007 for his east-germany-based drama " the lives of others . " the film , which features hollywood stars angelina jolie and johnny depp in the main roles , is a thriller set in venice about an american tourist -lrb- depp -rrb- who is used by an english woman -lrb- jolie -rrb- in an attempt to mislead those following her criminal ex-lover . bildunterschrift : angelina jolie und johnny depp star in " the tourist " napoleon exhibition talking about your country 's history is not always easy - the germans know this all too well .
in the case of france , this problem relates to its former ruler and military leader napoleon bonaparte .
many french people are not proud of his imperialistic conquests and demonstrations of power , so it is not easy to organize an exhibition on the topic in his homeland , according to the spokesperson for the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany in bonn . from december 17 , the art and exhibition hall will host the exhibition " napoleon and europe .
dream and trauma , " which aims to explain who napoleon really was and how he rose to power .
items on display include original documents , paintings and everyday objects .
the exhibition 's curator is french scholar benedicte savoy , who teaches art history at the berlin institute of technology .
the exhibition will travel to france in march next year .
bildunterschrift : the exhibition features paintings depicting the life of napoleon , including battle scenes merry christmas and happy new year in germany , advent marks the countdown to christmas , which celebrates the birth of jesus christ .
during this time , an advent wreath decorates the tables in many german households .
this tradition can be traced back to johann hinrich wichern , a 19th-century german protestant pastor , who invented the wreath to make the advent time seem shorter for children , since they could light one candle in it each day . some theaters in germany offer a special advent program , where on each of the days between december 1 and december 24 -lrb- christmas eve -rrb- a little " door " is opened to reveal entertaining acts such as story-reading , dancing and music . and once christmas is over , it is soon time for new year 's eve .
as is customary on this special night , a large fireworks show will take place at the brandenburg gate in berlin to ring in 2011 when the clock strikes midnight . bildunterschrift : advent calendars were invented to contain children 's excitement ahead of christmas author : petra lambeck -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? # morewwwlinkstext # napoleon exhibition at bonn 's art and exhibition hall feedback do you celebrate a special tradition in december ?

schalke 04 joined bayern munich in the last 16 of the champions league after a confident 3-0 win over lyon which hinted at a long-awaited return to form .
meanwhile , werder bremen continue to plumb the depths of despair . a team which had been struggling with a new faces and new tactics suddenly finds its feet in november , begins climbing the rungs in the bundesliga and marches in to the knockout stage of the champions league .
sound familiar ?
the story of bayern munich 's rise last season began , in some ways , like the unfolding tale of schalke 04 's campaign this time around .
bayern may never have flirted with the drop zone , but they began the season far off the pace .
right around the time christmas markets began opening up across the land , however , they found their rhythm - and built up the head of steam which carried them to their very successful end .
it remains fanciful to believe that schalke ’ s recent rampant form will be the start of a rise from the bottom to the top , resulting in schalke snatching the title in may , but it certainly appears - like bayern before them - that november is the month in which this schalke team began to click .
europe becomes schalke 's playground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huntelaar -lrb- m . -rrb- scored twice in schalke 's win over lyon schalke , in contrast to their wretched league from , have played well in europe nearly from the outset .
after a blip in their first group game at lyon , they have since won three and drawn one , a run of results which has seen them qualify for the knock-out rounds with a game to spare .
they could even go through as group winners .
wednesday night 's performance at home to lyon was the strongest indicator yet that schalke have turned a corner .
the team 's movement and one-touch passing was of such quality that it was hard to believe they were the same group that had sunk so desperately low in the bundesliga .
this was a truly european performance , with jefferson farfan and jose manuel jurado showing ingenuity and pace enough to rip the french defense to shreds .
raul , meanwhile , showed a growing belief in his new team , and klaas jan huntelaar 's rediscovered scoring touch can only bode well for the coming weeks .
schalke looked like they knew exactly what to do , and precisely what coach felix magath wanted from them .
even the royal blues ' defense , which has been shaky at best for most of the season , gave a commanding performance ; the much-maligned christoph metzelder and benedikt hoewedes in particular gave towering displays to cut out the threat from lyon 's ordinarily potent offense led by yoann gourcuff and lisandro lopez .
magath will now have confidence that his jigsaw is finally settling in place and that schalke can continue their climb out of the lower reaches of the bundesliga while progressing with flair in europe .
bremen in crisis as confidence goes awol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down and out : bremen 's loss to spurs ended their hopes werder bremen coach thomas schaaf has it worse - much worse .
taken apart by schalke last weekend in the league and dumped out of europe by tottenham hotspur on wednesday night , the north german club look destined to spend the remaining months of the season engaged in a fight for belief , if not survival , while felix magath 's side rub shoulders with the likes of barcelona , real madrid and manchester united .
bremen look such a broken team that it 's hard to see where any kind of recovery will come from .
the team werder sent out at white hart lane on wednesday was a mix of shell-shocked veterans and overwhelmed reserves who were getting a game only because of the team ’ s injury woes .
tottenham were 2-0 up at half time , but the way the beleaguered bremen squad left the pitch at the interval , they may as well have stayed in the locker room and taken the forfeit .
-lrb- the game did end 3-0 , as it happened . -rrb-
in the end , it did n't matter what the deficit was - werder were eliminated from the champions league .
moreover , they would need to beat european champions inter milan in their final group game , and make up a seven goal difference on fc twente to even have a chance of a place in the europa league place .
in other words , it ’ s not happening .
bremen have a north german derby on sunday against fc st. pauli which would usually be billed as a david and goliath clash .
on recent form though , it 's hard to say which is the skinny boy with the sling .
bremen 's response to dropping out of european competition for another season at home to pauli this weekend may determine their season .

while germans follow their royal neighbors with great interest , a new poll shows they 're quite content without a monarchy . despite massive interest in the royal families of other european countries , 67 percent of the germans surveyed do n't want their own royal family back .
the poll was commissioned as a new wave of royal wedding fever sweeps the country with the recent engagement of prince william and kate middleton making the front pages of almost all daily newspapers and glossy magazines . yet despite this keen interest in the affairs of other countries ' royal families , the majority of germans are content to observe the ups and downs of royal life beyond their own borders without wishing for a return to the days when germany itself boasted a royal court .
content with status quo on the streets of berlin , the general opinion of passersby certainly confirmed the findings of the stern survey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william and kate 's engagement caused a blizzard of press interest " we certainly do n't need a monarchy , " said one woman , " and all this hullaballoo they are making in england about it , i find that rather difficult to comprehend . "
" for germany , it 's definitely not something we need , " said one man , " i 'm happy that we 're a republic with a solid constitution .
it 's enough for me to read about this kind of thing in the paper . "
" i read in the paper just how much the british monarchy costs the taxpayer , " explained one man , " and for that reason alone it 's something we should n't indulge in ourselves . "
" we do still have a royal house of sorts , " explained one young woman , " and -lsb- defense minister -rsb- karl-theodor zu guttenberg has kind of become an ersatz king if you like .
he has the name , the heritage , the popularity and represents that there is a need for this kind of person in germany . "
nearly a century ago germany 's monarchy was abolished in 1918 at the end of world war i and the abdication of kaiser wilhelm ii .
after giving up the german throne , he fled to the netherlands and spent the rest of his life there in relative obscurity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiser wilhelm ii , germany 's last emperor , held office from 1888-1918 while the kaiser 's descendants today are rarely mentioned in the german press , wilhelm 's crypt in huis doorn , netherlands , is an annual meeting place for a small but dedicated number of german monarchists who come together on the anniversary of his death on november 18 .
kaiser wilhelm ii 's involvement in world war i is arguably the reason why he is not glorified by germans today and why they seek their royal role models elsewhere .
the june wedding of victoria , crown princess of sweden to daniel westling was watched by a global audience of around 1 billion while the couple 's popularity in their home country soared with around 70 percent of swedes declaring their support for the monarchy .
since prince william and kate middleton 's engagement in kenya in october , germans have been keenly following the story and will no doubt be glued to the television when the couple ties the knot in 2011 .

now it barely glimmers in the history books .
however , author and journalist regine beyer , who has just published a new biography of stone entitled " abendkleid und filzstiefen " -lrb- " evening dress and felt boots " -rrb- , hopes her book will see a resurgence in popularity for this vibrant but overlooked singer .
" she was a very optimistic person and i mean optimism in this case as a source of life power , " said beyer , " she was very intelligent , she kept changing with the times , she connected a lot of different kinds of people and that is something that i aspire to as well . "
after more than a decade of weekly meetings gathering material for the book , beyer and stone became firm friends , although this developing affection between the two women did n't color the text which beyer ultimately published .
" i think as a journalist , i know how to keep the balance between journalism and a certain kind of empathy , " she pointed out , " i allowed her a lot of space to keep her spirit in the book . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stone sisters : peggy stone -lrb- r -rrb- with best friend laelia rivlin life upset by war stone was born rosa goldstein in berlin in 1907 to german-jewish parents and shortly after her birth the family moved to bialystok in poland and from there to moscow where the young rosa studied piano .
after the 1917 revolution , mrs. goldstein fled russia with her three daughters and made her way back to berlin via bialystok , where the family was finally reunited with mr. goldstein in 1922 .
at the age of 12 , a love of singing and dance earned rosa the nickname peggy , partly due to her resemblance to the american child actress , peggy montgomery .
it was in weimar-era germany in the 1920s that peggy began her career as a performer .
she cut her teeth singing in cinemas , working as a chorus girl and appearing as a film extra .
her first flush of true success came in 1928 when , with her friend laelia rivilin , she founded the stone sisters .
two girls - each with a piano - performed a wild mix of jazz standards , ragtime , swing and popular german " schlager " music .
the duo 's career was guided by theater impressario kurt robitschek who secured bookings for the girls at important cabarets such as the tivoli , the trocadero and the moulin rouge .
the rise of nazism in germany forced peggy to flee the country in 1933 .
she settled in sweden and then russia where , with the czernowitzer jazz orchestra , she toured military bases and field hospitals entertaining russian servicemen .
at the end of world war ii , she was living in bucharest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author regine beyer spent 10 years interviewing peggy stone in new york new beginning in new york by the early 50s , peggy had re-located once again , this time to israel , but with few opportunities to perform available in the fledgling state , she packed her bags and moved for what would be the last time .
in 1953 , new york would become her permanent home but , by now in her late 40s , her career as a performer was over and she moved instead into the fashion industry working as a successful copyist .
it was here in the late 90s that author regine beyer met stone and began to record her life story , determined one day to turn it into a biography .
britta juergs from the aviva publishing house also fell for stone 's story and agreed to produce the book .
" maybe she 's not so famous , but she 's such an interesting woman , " she said , " in the book we have lots of original peggy .
there are parts of regine and there are parts of peggy stone and i think that 's really great to hear her because she had lots and lots of humor and it 's great to read . "
despite her contribution to the entertainment world and widespread popularity in her day , peggy stone has faded into relative obscurity ; partly because she was n't political or ground-breaking and also because she was active at a time when women had fewer opportunities than men to be recorded and preserved for posterity .
in 10 years of researching her subject , regine beyer was unable to unearth a single professional audio recording of peggy stone performing .
a natural optimist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyer 's new biography of stone now , the public has an opportunity to rediscover the world of peggy stone and her biographer and friend regine beyer wants them to remember her " as a woman who lived through very difficult times , who complained very little , who stood up to the reality , who tried to live her life the best she could and who also had a real great knack for putting people in touch from very different backgrounds . "
" she was a people 's person and she was always believing in life and that 's a great message , " added beyer .

but critics say the plan misses the point and burdens domestic companies instead . as online advertising continues to grow rapidly throughout europe , french senators this week approved a new tax law aimed at securing the government to a piece of the revenue pie .
although the measure is popularly known as the " google tax " , it does not directly impact the internet giant , which has based its advertising business offshore and out of reach of french tax collectors .
instead , the one-percent charge will be levied on all french-based companies purchasing online publicity services .
the measure is expected to become law in 2011 and generate between 10 and 20 million euros per year if it is passed by the national assembly , as predicted .
supporters of the tax say it will put online advertising on an equality footing with other media .
broadcast and print advertisements are already subject to taxation in france .
television advertising alone pumps roughly 70 million euros into government coffers annually .
but critics say the government 's plan fails to meet its original goal : to tax the french operations of internet giants such as google , microsoft , ebay and amazon , which are located strategically in european countries with low corporate tax rates , such as ireland and luxembourg .
french business leaders fear the measure will burden small advertisers and lead to an exodus of larger internet stakeholders from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original goal of the levy was to tax offshore internet giants ' profits according to iab europe – an umbrella organization representing national trade associations for digital and interactive marketing – france 's online advertising market is europe 's third largest after the united kingdom and germany .
in 2009 , the uk market was worth 4 billion euros , the german market worth 3 billion , and the french market worth 1.7 billion .
kimon zorbas , vice president of iab europe , says the proposed law is shortsighted in that it hits french companies while giving their foreign competitors a break .
" our position is that this is a market which is already less than half the size of the english market .
france has a lot of catching up to do , and such a tax on a developing market is doubly negative , " he told deutsche welle .
" any tax is bound to have an effect on the market .

but critics say the plan misses the point and burdens domestic companies instead . as online advertising continues to grow rapidly throughout europe , french senators this week approved a new tax law aimed at securing the government to a piece of the revenue pie .
although the measure is popularly known as the " google tax " , it does not directly impact the internet giant , which has based its advertising business offshore and out of reach of french tax collectors .
instead , the one-percent charge will be levied on all french-based companies purchasing online publicity services .
the measure is expected to become law in 2011 and generate between 10 and 20 million euros per year if it is passed by the national assembly , as predicted .
supporters of the tax say it will put online advertising on an equality footing with other media .
broadcast and print advertisements are already subject to taxation in france .
television advertising alone pumps roughly 70 million euros into government coffers annually .
but critics say the government 's plan fails to meet its original goal : to tax the french operations of internet giants such as google , microsoft , ebay and amazon , which are located strategically in european countries with low corporate tax rates , such as ireland and luxembourg .
french business leaders fear the measure will burden small advertisers and lead to an exodus of larger internet stakeholders from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original goal of the levy was to tax offshore internet giants ' profits according to iab europe – an umbrella organization representing national trade associations for digital and interactive marketing – france 's online advertising market is europe 's third largest after the united kingdom and germany .
in 2009 , the uk market was worth 4 billion euros , the german market worth 3 billion , and the french market worth 1.7 billion .
kimon zorbas , vice president of iab europe , says the proposed law is shortsighted in that it hits french companies while giving their foreign competitors a break .
" our position is that this is a market which is already less than half the size of the english market .
france has a lot of catching up to do , and such a tax on a developing market is doubly negative , " he told deutsche welle .
" any tax is bound to have an effect on the market .
naturally the question now is how big of an effect , and that 's something we ca n't yet know . "

yet financial markets remain nervous , fearing that spain and portugal may be next in line for eu aid . eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs olli rehn has applauded ireland 's 15-billion-euro -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- austerity package as " a sound basis for the negotiations " on an international bailout . ireland has set out a four-year plan to save the 15 billion euros in order to secure an international bailout expected to be in the region of 85 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts do not necessarily share olli rehn 's confidence under the national recovery plan , the irish republic aims to bring its budget deficit down from a projected 32 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to three percent of gdp by 2014 by imposing tax increases , wage cuts and by curbing public spending .
irish prime minister brian cowen conceded that the average living standard in his country was likely to suffer as a result of the severe cuts .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicholas sarkozy were said to be " impressed " with the recovery program , after discussing the situation in ireland by telephone on thursday .
a statement from the chancellor 's office added that both leaders " agreed that negotiations with the irish government must be rapidly concluded . " 85 billion - or more the drastic austerity measures are the condition for ireland to receive help from eu funds .
cowen has given 85 billion euros as the sum that his country would need , but negotiations with brussels and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- are still ongoing .
experts , however , warn that more money could be needed to avoid the former celtic tiger from sliding into bankruptcy .
constantin gurdgiev , an economist at trinity college in dublin , said the situation was even worse than in greece .
" our economy has more than three times more debt .
if greece is bankrupt - what then are we ? " he asked .
in the wake of the crisis in ireland international financial markets are getting increasingly nervous about portugal and spain .
both countries are feared to be the next possible candidates in need of an eu bailout .
" there 's nothing that politics can do to ease that tension on the markets , " lueder gerken , head of the center for european policy , told the neue rhein zeitung daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is expected by many to be the next eu country in need of help from brussels " of course there will be a domino effect - regardless of what 'll happen in ireland .
the markets have already set their eyes on portugal , and spain too looks to be set for trouble , " he added .
portugal , spain insist they wo n't be next herman van rompuy , head of the eu council , is trying to calm those concerns .
he said that any fears of a repeat of the irish crisis in portugal were baseless .
portugal 's debt was lower , there was n't a real estate crisis there , and the banks had enough capital reserves , van rompuy said .
" all that talk has neither an economic nor a rational basis . "
portuguese prime minister jose socrates also tried to reassure the public that his country would not need any eu help .
but his government 's plans for tough austerity measures have met with strong opposition , strikes and demonstrations - and a one-day general strike on tuesday .
spain , too , tried to dismiss fears that it would soon need eu aid .
" we are worlds apart from ireland , " deputy economics minister jose manual campa said .
unlike ireland , spain was a country with a comparatively low deficit and already in the process of consolidation , he added .
yet experts are somewhat less optimistic than madrid .
unemployment in spain has reached 20 percent , and economic growth is stagnating .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 25.11.2010 putin calls for closer economic cooperation with the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin says moscow and brussels need to join forces russian prime minister vladimir putin has said his country wants to work more closely with the european union in the future , possibly establishing a free trade zone .
his comments come ahead of a two-day visit to germany . russia is aiming for a free trade zone and a common industrial policy with the european union .
prime minister vladimir putin , writing in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung on thursday , said his goal was to create " a harmonious economic community from lisbon to vladivostok . "
cooperation between russia and the eu could even result in a free trade agreement or similar forms of economic integration eventually leading to a " common continental market . "
" we should be frank about it : the global economic crisis has revealed both russia and the eu to be economically very vulnerable , " putin wrote .
russia , he argued , was still too dependent on its energy exports , while the eu was in danger of jeopardizing its position on the international markets , due to a decrease in its industrial productivity .
" what 's on the agenda : how can we trigger a new wave of industrialization to roll across europe , " putin wrote .
different takes on energy cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' both russia and the eu have been shown to be economically very vulnerable ' : putin he suggested strategic alliances in key industries , including shipbuilding , car manufacturing , space exploration and the pharmaceutical industry .
energy policy , putin wrote , was another field where closer cooperation was needed .
from nuclear technology to gas and oil exploitation , there was a need for closer ties with brussels .
the european union gets around 25 percent of its natural gas from russia .
in the past , however , brussels has left little doubt that it wants to diversify its energy supply to reduce dependency on russia .
interruptions to the supply have in recent years lead to energy shortages in several eu member states .
putin also called for easing and eventually lifting visa restrictions between the eu and russia .
this , he wrote , would bring about not the end but rather the beginning of true integration between his country and the 27-nation bloc .
putin 's comments preceded his visit to germany , which starts on thursday .
he is scheduled to meet with german chancellor angela merkel on friday .
merkel , meanwhile , has downplayed the chances of a possible free trade zone .
speaking to reporters in berlin on thursday , she pointed to russian high tariffs and moscow 's trade relations with neighboring countries as potential stumbling blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas transit interruptions have led to tensions with moscow " of course we support the idea of a free trade zone between the eu and russia but i have to pour a bit of cold water on it , " she said .
" the steps that russia has taken recently do not point in that direction . "
she pointed out that russia , not yet part of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , has established trade ties with kazakhstan and belarus , countries whose statuses as potential wto members are far less certain than russia 's .
eon , gazprom on the agenda merkel and putin are also expected to discuss german energy company eon possibly selling its shares in russia 's gazprom .
media reports on wednesday suggested eon plans to drop the 3.5 percent stake it holds in the russian energy giant .
eon had dismissed reports that it would sell its 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- in shares , while a government spokesman in berlin confirmed the issue was on the agenda of the merkel-putin talks .
the eu is russia 's largest trading partner , making up about one half of its foreign trade .
total trade in the first half of the year was $ 141.9 billion -lrb- 106.3 billion euros -rrb- , according to the russian federal customs agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 25.11.2010 schalke 's confidence soars in europe while bremen plumbs new depths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could raul and schalke be about to take flight in europe ?
schalke 04 joined bayern munich in the last 16 of the champions league after a confident 3-0 win over lyon which hinted at a long-awaited return to form .
meanwhile , werder bremen continue to plumb the depths of despair . a team which had been struggling with a new faces and new tactics suddenly finds its feet in november , begins climbing the rungs in the bundesliga and marches in to the knockout stage of the champions league .
sound familiar ?
the story of bayern munich 's rise last season began , in some ways , like the unfolding tale of schalke 04 's campaign this time around .
bayern may never have flirted with the drop zone , but they began the season far off the pace .
right around the time christmas markets began opening up across the land , however , they found their rhythm - and built up the head of steam which carried them to their very successful end .
it remains fanciful to believe that schalke ’ s recent rampant form will be the start of a rise from the bottom to the top , resulting in schalke snatching the title in may , but it certainly appears - like bayern before them - that november is the month in which this schalke team began to click .
europe becomes schalke 's playground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huntelaar -lrb- m . -rrb- scored twice in schalke 's win over lyon schalke , in contrast to their wretched league from , have played well in europe nearly from the outset .
after a blip in their first group game at lyon , they have since won three and drawn one , a run of results which has seen them qualify for the knock-out rounds with a game to spare .
they could even go through as group winners .
wednesday night 's performance at home to lyon was the strongest indicator yet that schalke have turned a corner .
the team 's movement and one-touch passing was of such quality that it was hard to believe they were the same group that had sunk so desperately low in the bundesliga .
this was a truly european performance , with jefferson farfan and jose manuel jurado showing ingenuity and pace enough to rip the french defense to shreds .
raul , meanwhile , showed a growing belief in his new team , and klaas jan huntelaar 's rediscovered scoring touch can only bode well for the coming weeks .
schalke looked like they knew exactly what to do , and precisely what coach felix magath wanted from them .
even the royal blues ' defense , which has been shaky at best for most of the season , gave a commanding performance ; the much-maligned christoph metzelder and benedikt hoewedes in particular gave towering displays to cut out the threat from lyon 's ordinarily potent offense led by yoann gourcuff and lisandro lopez .
magath will now have confidence that his jigsaw is finally settling in place and that schalke can continue their climb out of the lower reaches of the bundesliga while progressing with flair in europe .
bremen in crisis as confidence goes awol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down and out : bremen 's loss to spurs ended their hopes werder bremen coach thomas schaaf has it worse - much worse .
taken apart by schalke last weekend in the league and dumped out of europe by tottenham hotspur on wednesday night , the north german club look destined to spend the remaining months of the season engaged in a fight for belief , if not survival , while felix magath 's side rub shoulders with the likes of barcelona , real madrid and manchester united .
bremen look such a broken team that it 's hard to see where any kind of recovery will come from .
the team werder sent out at white hart lane on wednesday was a mix of shell-shocked veterans and overwhelmed reserves who were getting a game only because of the team ’ s injury woes .
tottenham were 2-0 up at half time , but the way the beleaguered bremen squad left the pitch at the interval , they may as well have stayed in the locker room and taken the forfeit .
-lrb- the game did end 3-0 , as it happened . -rrb-
in the end , it did n't matter what the deficit was - werder were eliminated from the champions league .
moreover , they would need to beat european champions inter milan in their final group game , and make up a seven goal difference on fc twente to even have a chance of a place in the europa league place .
in other words , it ’ s not happening .
bremen have a north german derby on sunday against fc st. pauli which would usually be billed as a david and goliath clash .
on recent form though , it 's hard to say which is the skinny boy with the sling .
bremen 's response to dropping out of european competition for another season at home to pauli this weekend may determine their season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.11.2010 specter of ' ghost estates ' haunt post-property boom ireland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's easy to find housing estates like spencer dock in ireland the building boom , when economic times were good in ireland , has led to a huge oversupply of homes across the country .
so-called " ghost estates " now blight the republic , with many homes left unoccupied or unfinished . ask a taxi driver in dublin to take you to a " ghost estate , " and a kind one will point out that you can walk there and do n't actually need a cab .
there are several examples of unfinished or largely unoccupied housing developments in the irish capital , one of which is called spencer dock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while there may be lots of housing , there are few real homes spencer dock 's developers say the project will be completed and residency rates will rise , but it is currently far emptier than they would like , and stationary cranes dot the landscape with unfinished buildings breaking the skyline . apart from the main road a street away , there is little activity - the sound of children playing outside is rarely heard , for example , according to those people who have taken up residence .
there is also a shiny new tram line , but very few people waiting to use it .
it is hard to find irish residents living in this development off the banks of the river liffey and just outside the center of dublin .
mikaela ekman moved here from sweden .
she acknowledged the strange atmosphere in the largely empty neighborhood .
" yeah , it 's very half finished ! " she said , laughing and pointing to the cranes around nearby buildings .
spencer dock 's developers have even had to launch legal action against customers who agreed to buy property on the site but have changed their mind in view of plummeting home values and low residency .
a problem not confined to dublin there are far too many buildings for people in ireland , according to brendan williams , a lecturer in urban development at university college dublin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williams says housing supply vastly outstrips demand " we estimate that the overproduction or oversupply in the housing area is approximately 17 percent ; in other areas , such as commercial and offices , it 's of the order of 20 percent , " he said .
" there is also an oversupply in other sectors as well , such as hotels . "
williams says construction continued at a rapid pace in the irish republic long after signs appeared that the economy was cooling , with disastrous effects for irish banks that invested heavily in the housing boom .
" in a general sense , there was an oversupply and an overbuilding that continued largely through the period 2004-2009 , which contributed , obviously , to the eventual failure of the property market . "
nearly 100,000 homes were built in 2006 alone .
williams said house prices have crashed by as much as 50 percent from their peak .
that has wiped billions of euros off the balance sheets of the banks .
what now for ghost estates ?
it 's not clear exactly how many homes are unoccupied across ireland .
some estimates put the figure as high as 300,000 .
what is clear is that for the few residents who live in the ghost estates , life can be miserable .
some have such low occupancy rates that shopkeepers have declined to open in the area ; on some one side of the road is finished , while the other is not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steven lewis is very aware of the problems of living on a ghost estate steven lewis is one of those who has chosen to live on what he himself describes as a ghost estate just outside dublin .
he has done so because rent is cheap , but admits there is a downside .
" i 've had my car broken into three times this year , " he said , acknowledging the problems with crime on estates where little pride is felt by residents for their unfinished surroundings .
steven sympathizes with those people who actually bought property where he lives .
" my heart goes out to working class families that have bought a home , and they open up their windows and they see a half-finished house across the road from them , " he said .
" they 're now developing sewerage problems and all sorts of other health issues .
my heart seriously goes out to these people because they ca n't move on now . "
a need to face up to reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are new tram connections , but few passengers to use them the solution to these problems is one that may be unpalatable to banks , developers and property owners alike .
williams says that people need to acknowledge the realities of vast oversupply and start selling unoccupied properties in ghost estates at vastly knocked-down prices .
but there 's another looming problem that could make such steps immaterial : with tens of thousands of people expected to leave ireland in the coming years because of its economic problems , excess supply in the housing market may yet worsen further .

this discovery could be used to develop better microchips for computers or more efficient solar energy technology , according to their research which was published in the journal nature on thursday .
bose-einstein condensates -lrb- bec -rrb- were first proposed in the 1920s by satyendra nath bose and albert einstein , who asserted that atoms , chilled to very near absolute zero , would take on quantum characteristics , so that the atoms " overlap , and behave as a giant meta-wave , " or a sort of super-atom , wherein a collection of atoms all act in concert , weitz told deutsche welle .
not everyone in the field of quantum optics is happy with the term super-atom or super-photon though , such as aephraim steinberg , a quantum physicist at the university of toronto .
" i find the word a little confusing and misleading , so i wouldn ’ t really want to call this a super photon , " steinberg said . within the bec there is still a collection of weakly interacting particles ; they don ’ t merge together to create a new molecule or new solid , but they take on an additional property that they all want to behave the same way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin weitz and his team worked on the experiment for three years " so it 's no more a super-atom than an army is a super person ; there may be ten thousand people marching in the same direction , but they 're not some sort of new creature , " steinberg said . the bec state was previously believed to apply only to atoms and not to photons , since the cooling process would force the photons to be absorbed by surrounding atoms in the apparatus . " if you cool down light , normally the light goes away , " weitz explained .
" if you turn off a light bulb then the filament cools down and it changes its color from yellow to red , as the number of photons is reduced , becoming dimmer and dimmer until they disappear entirely . " photons acting like atoms but now weitz , along with jan klaers , julian schmitt and frank vewinger , has managed to create a photonic bec at room temperature by trapping photons between two concave mirrors . the experiment also made use of liquid dye pigment that cooled the photons down to room temperature while they were trapped between the two mirrors .
when enough photons were pumped into this apparatus , a bec state was observed " which appeared as a yellow peak in the middle and there the photons marched in step , " weitz said . the discovery took three years of research and is being hailed as a major breakthrough in the field of quantum physics . matthias weidemueller , a quantum physicist at the university of freiburg , said in the journal nature that the experiment was " truly ingenious . " " compared to bose-einstein condensation with ultracold atoms , the current experiment is ridiculously simple , " he said . but some in the field maintain that , while the results are welcome and that the concept of a bec of photons was controversial , it 's not completely unexpected .
aephraim steinberg , a quantum physicist at the university of toronto , says quantum mechanics basically dictate that all bosons , a category which includes rubidium-87 atoms used in atomic bec , as well as photons , want to act in the same way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one potential application would be the creation of shortwave lasers " i think there 's been a lot of confusion and i think -lrb- this experiment -rrb- helps clarify some fundamental physics to see that , at a deep level , all particles are really the same , whether it ’ s a boson of light or a boson of rubidium , they really do have the same properties if you put them in the right circumstances , " steinberg said in a telephone interview . putting it to work weitz has a couple of ideas for applications resulting from the research at the university of bonn .
creating shortwave lasers in the x-ray or ultra-violet spectrum is one such idea . such shortwave lasers would be well-suited to the manufacture of computer chips as the process uses lasers to etch logic circuits onto semiconductor materials .
the precision of shortwave lasers is superior to those with longer wavelengths , which would allow chip designers to create more complex circuitry on the same area of silcon . another possible application using this apparatus , but with less light , weitz said , would be to concentrate the light for solar cells .
by placing the apparatus before a solar cell , " you could save a lot of money because you could use smaller solar cells but nevertheless , get all the light , " weitz said . weitz and his colleagues will now be focusing on learning more about the photonic bec they 've created , and also attempting to simplify the apparatus by switching out the liquid dye currently used , for a solid-state dye , which would require less equipment to manage . author : stuart tiffen editor : nicole goebel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so-called " ghost estates " now blight the republic , with many homes left unoccupied or unfinished . ask a taxi driver in dublin to take you to a " ghost estate , " and a kind one will point out that you can walk there and do n't actually need a cab .
there are several examples of unfinished or largely unoccupied housing developments in the irish capital , one of which is called spencer dock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while there may be lots of housing , there are few real homes spencer dock 's developers say the project will be completed and residency rates will rise , but it is currently far emptier than they would like , and stationary cranes dot the landscape with unfinished buildings breaking the skyline . apart from the main road a street away , there is little activity - the sound of children playing outside is rarely heard , for example , according to those people who have taken up residence .
there is also a shiny new tram line , but very few people waiting to use it .
it is hard to find irish residents living in this development off the banks of the river liffey and just outside the center of dublin .
mikaela ekman moved here from sweden .
she acknowledged the strange atmosphere in the largely empty neighborhood .
" yeah , it 's very half finished ! " she said , laughing and pointing to the cranes around nearby buildings .
spencer dock 's developers have even had to launch legal action against customers who agreed to buy property on the site but have changed their mind in view of plummeting home values and low residency .
a problem not confined to dublin there are far too many buildings for people in ireland , according to brendan williams , a lecturer in urban development at university college dublin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williams says housing supply vastly outstrips demand " we estimate that the overproduction or oversupply in the housing area is approximately 17 percent ; in other areas , such as commercial and offices , it 's of the order of 20 percent , " he said .
" there is also an oversupply in other sectors as well , such as hotels . "
williams says construction continued at a rapid pace in the irish republic long after signs appeared that the economy was cooling , with disastrous effects for irish banks that invested heavily in the housing boom .
" in a general sense , there was an oversupply and an overbuilding that continued largely through the period 2004-2009 , which contributed , obviously , to the eventual failure of the property market . "
nearly 100,000 homes were built in 2006 alone .
williams said house prices have crashed by as much as 50 percent from their peak .
that has wiped billions of euros off the balance sheets of the banks .
what now for ghost estates ?
it 's not clear exactly how many homes are unoccupied across ireland .
some estimates put the figure as high as 300,000 .
what is clear is that for the few residents who live in the ghost estates , life can be miserable .
some have such low occupancy rates that shopkeepers have declined to open in the area ; on some one side of the road is finished , while the other is not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steven lewis is very aware of the problems of living on a ghost estate steven lewis is one of those who has chosen to live on what he himself describes as a ghost estate just outside dublin .
he has done so because rent is cheap , but admits there is a downside .
" i 've had my car broken into three times this year , " he said , acknowledging the problems with crime on estates where little pride is felt by residents for their unfinished surroundings .
steven sympathizes with those people who actually bought property where he lives .
" my heart goes out to working class families that have bought a home , and they open up their windows and they see a half-finished house across the road from them , " he said .
" they 're now developing sewerage problems and all sorts of other health issues .
my heart seriously goes out to these people because they ca n't move on now . "
a need to face up to reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are new tram connections , but few passengers to use them the solution to these problems is one that may be unpalatable to banks , developers and property owners alike .
williams says that people need to acknowledge the realities of vast oversupply and start selling unoccupied properties in ghost estates at vastly knocked-down prices .
but there 's another looming problem that could make such steps immaterial : with tens of thousands of people expected to leave ireland in the coming years because of its economic problems , excess supply in the housing market may yet worsen further .

this discovery could be used to develop better microchips for computers or more efficient solar energy technology , according to their research which was published in the journal nature on thursday .
bose-einstein condensates -lrb- bec -rrb- were first proposed in the 1920s by satyendra nath bose and albert einstein , who asserted that atoms , chilled to very near absolute zero , would take on quantum characteristics , so that the atoms " overlap , and behave as a giant meta-wave , " or a sort of super-atom , wherein a collection of atoms all act in concert , weitz told deutsche welle .
not everyone in the field of quantum optics is happy with the term super-atom or super-photon though , such as aephraim steinberg , a quantum physicist at the university of toronto .
" i find the word a little confusing and misleading , so i wouldn ’ t really want to call this a super photon , " steinberg said . within the bec there is still a collection of weakly interacting particles ; they don ’ t merge together to create a new molecule or new solid , but they take on an additional property that they all want to behave the same way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin weitz and his team worked on the experiment for three years " so it 's no more a super-atom than an army is a super person ; there may be ten thousand people marching in the same direction , but they 're not some sort of new creature , " steinberg said . the bec state was previously believed to apply only to atoms and not to photons , since the cooling process would force the photons to be absorbed by surrounding atoms in the apparatus . " if you cool down light , normally the light goes away , " weitz explained .
" if you turn off a light bulb then the filament cools down and it changes its color from yellow to red , as the number of photons is reduced , becoming dimmer and dimmer until they disappear entirely . " photons acting like atoms but now weitz , along with jan klaers , julian schmitt and frank vewinger , has managed to create a photonic bec at room temperature by trapping photons between two concave mirrors . the experiment also made use of liquid dye pigment that cooled the photons down to room temperature while they were trapped between the two mirrors .
when enough photons were pumped into this apparatus , a bec state was observed " which appeared as a yellow peak in the middle and there the photons marched in step , " weitz said . the discovery took three years of research and is being hailed as a major breakthrough in the field of quantum physics . matthias weidemueller , a quantum physicist at the university of freiburg , said in the journal nature that the experiment was " truly ingenious . " " compared to bose-einstein condensation with ultracold atoms , the current experiment is ridiculously simple , " he said . but some in the field maintain that , while the results are welcome and that the concept of a bec of photons was controversial , it 's not completely unexpected .
aephraim steinberg , a quantum physicist at the university of toronto , says quantum mechanics basically dictate that all bosons , a category which includes rubidium-87 atoms used in atomic bec , as well as photons , want to act in the same way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one potential application would be the creation of shortwave lasers " i think there 's been a lot of confusion and i think -lrb- this experiment -rrb- helps clarify some fundamental physics to see that , at a deep level , all particles are really the same , whether it ’ s a boson of light or a boson of rubidium , they really do have the same properties if you put them in the right circumstances , " steinberg said in a telephone interview . putting it to work weitz has a couple of ideas for applications resulting from the research at the university of bonn .

faber escaped a dutch prison in 1952 and has since lived a quiet life in germany . authorities in the netherlands have issued a european arrest warrant for a convicted nazi war criminal living in germany .
dutch-born klaas carel faber had been sentenced to death by a netherlands court in 1947 for the murder of several prisoners in the westerbork transit camp in 1944 .
the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1948 .
faber escaped from prison in 1952 .
he fled across the border to west germany , where he later received citizenship , and moved to bavaria .
faber served in a special ss death squad that was tasked with killing dutch civilians classified as " anti-german " or linked to dutch resistance in the german-occupied netherlands .
the 88-year old is high on the simon wiesenthal center 's list of wanted nazi criminals .
the israeli government has also repeatedly called for him to be brought to justice .
extradition request to follow berlin , however , has so far refused to extradite him .
in 1957 a court in dusseldorf dismissed charges against faber for lack of evidence brought against him .
a dutch extradition request in 2004 was turned down with reference to that 1957 decision .
in 2006 new evidence was brought before a court in munich , but the judges saw the cases as manslaughter rather than murder - which meant the crimes had lapsed under the statute of limitations .
in order to re-examine the case with new evidence , a new arrest warrant from dutch authorities was needed .
dutch public prosecutors are for the first time trying to use the european arrest warrant system , which has been in place since 2002 .
the arrest warrant for faber is a preliminary step before the formal extradition request to germany .
in march 2010 a german court convicted heinrich boere - another member of faber 's unit - and sentenced him to life imprisonment .
boere 's lawyers have appealed the verdict .

faber escaped a dutch prison in 1952 and has since lived a quiet life in germany . authorities in the netherlands have issued a european arrest warrant for a convicted nazi war criminal living in germany .
dutch-born klaas carel faber had been sentenced to death by a netherlands court in 1947 for the murder of several prisoners in the westerbork transit camp in 1944 .
the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1948 .
faber escaped from prison in 1952 .
he fled across the border to west germany , where he later received citizenship , and moved to bavaria .
faber served in a special ss death squad that was tasked with killing dutch civilians classified as " anti-german " or linked to dutch resistance in the german-occupied netherlands .
the 88-year old is high on the simon wiesenthal center 's list of wanted nazi criminals .
the israeli government has also repeatedly called for him to be brought to justice .
extradition request to follow berlin , however , has so far refused to extradite him .
in 1957 a court in dusseldorf dismissed charges against faber for lack of evidence brought against him .
a dutch extradition request in 2004 was turned down with reference to that 1957 decision .
in 2006 new evidence was brought before a court in munich , but the judges saw the cases as manslaughter rather than murder - which meant the crimes had lapsed under the statute of limitations .
in order to re-examine the case with new evidence , a new arrest warrant from dutch authorities was needed .
dutch public prosecutors are for the first time trying to use the european arrest warrant system , which has been in place since 2002 .
the arrest warrant for faber is a preliminary step before the formal extradition request to germany .
in march 2010 a german court convicted heinrich boere - another member of faber 's unit - and sentenced him to life imprisonment .
boere 's lawyers have appealed the verdict .

but the opposition thinks not everyone is benefitting from the boom . just in time for the christmas , it seems german consumers are rediscovering the joys of shopping .
speaking to the lower house of the german parliament on thursday , economics minister rainer bruederle said domestic demand was on the upswing and stronger than expected , as consumers were once again feeling comfortable enough to go out and spend .
" we 're consuming again , people are doing well and people are spending again , " said bruederle , calling the economic upswing like something " out of a fairy tale . "
germany 's gross domestic product is expected to grow by about 3.5 percent this year , nearing a two-decade high , and by 2.6 percent in 2011 .
bruederle said under the governing center-right coalition of the christian democrats and the liberal free democrats , germany has become the economic model for all of europe , adding that the country could expect to enjoy its current economic growth for the foreseeable future .
the market research firm gfk said consumer morale rose more than expected in november , for the sixth month in a row .
and german business sentiment rose to its strongest level since 1991 in november , according to the ifo economic think tank .
in october , unemployment fell to an 18-year low , dropping below three million for the first time since november 2008 .
bruederle is convinced that full employment could soon be a possibility , adding that in many regions in the south of the country this was already a reality .
opposition calls for wage increases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said germany had become the economic model for all of europe however , the opposition greens , social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and left party criticized bruederle 's comments , saying the economic boom was leaving the unemployed , retired and poor behind .
garrelt duin , of the spd , said the economic upswing was not stable or balanced .
he said both domestic investment and wages needed to increase , to support the increased domestic demand .
michael schlecht of the left party pointed out that while businesses were enjoying a growth in profits of up to 40 percent , wages had hardly followed suit .
he said that since 2000 , businesses had seen incomes increase by at least 50 percent , but the income of the average worker has actually dropped .
schlecht also said austerity programs in other european union countries , such as greece and ireland , would have a negative trickledown effect on german exports , on which germany has traditionally relied to support its growth .
he called for a reversal of the reforms to the “ hartz iv ” welfare subsidy program and for the introduction of a set minimum wage of 10 euros -lrb- $ 13.4 -rrb- per hour , to shore up the domestic growth sector .

his comments come ahead of a two-day visit to germany . russia is aiming for a free trade zone and a common industrial policy with the european union .
prime minister vladimir putin , writing in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung on thursday , said his goal was to create " a harmonious economic community from lisbon to vladivostok . "
cooperation between russia and the eu could even result in a free trade agreement or similar forms of economic integration eventually leading to a " common continental market . "
" we should be frank about it : the global economic crisis has revealed both russia and the eu to be economically very vulnerable , " putin wrote .
russia , he argued , was still too dependent on its energy exports , while the eu was in danger of jeopardizing its position on the international markets , due to a decrease in its industrial productivity .
" what 's on the agenda : how can we trigger a new wave of industrialization to roll across europe , " putin wrote .
different takes on energy cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' both russia and the eu have been shown to be economically very vulnerable ' : putin he suggested strategic alliances in key industries , including shipbuilding , car manufacturing , space exploration and the pharmaceutical industry .
energy policy , putin wrote , was another field where closer cooperation was needed .
from nuclear technology to gas and oil exploitation , there was a need for closer ties with brussels .
the european union gets around 25 percent of its natural gas from russia .
in the past , however , brussels has left little doubt that it wants to diversify its energy supply to reduce dependency on russia .
interruptions to the supply have in recent years lead to energy shortages in several eu member states .
putin also called for easing and eventually lifting visa restrictions between the eu and russia .
this , he wrote , would bring about not the end but rather the beginning of true integration between his country and the 27-nation bloc .
putin 's comments preceded his visit to germany , which starts on thursday .
he is scheduled to meet with german chancellor angela merkel on friday .
merkel , meanwhile , has downplayed the chances of a possible free trade zone .
speaking to reporters in berlin on thursday , she pointed to russian high tariffs and moscow 's trade relations with neighboring countries as potential stumbling blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas transit interruptions have led to tensions with moscow " of course we support the idea of a free trade zone between the eu and russia but i have to pour a bit of cold water on it , " she said .
" the steps that russia has taken recently do not point in that direction . "
she pointed out that russia , not yet part of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , has established trade ties with kazakhstan and belarus , countries whose statuses as potential wto members are far less certain than russia 's .
eon , gazprom on the agenda merkel and putin are also expected to discuss german energy company eon possibly selling its shares in russia 's gazprom .
media reports on wednesday suggested eon plans to drop the 3.5 percent stake it holds in the russian energy giant .
eon had dismissed reports that it would sell its 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- in shares , while a government spokesman in berlin confirmed the issue was on the agenda of the merkel-putin talks .
the eu is russia 's largest trading partner , making up about one half of its foreign trade .
total trade in the first half of the year was $ 141.9 billion -lrb- 106.3 billion euros -rrb- , according to the russian federal customs agency .

his comments come ahead of a two-day visit to germany . russia is aiming for a free trade zone and a common industrial policy with the european union .
prime minister vladimir putin , writing in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung on thursday , said his goal was to create " a harmonious economic community from lisbon to vladivostok . "
cooperation between russia and the eu could even result in a free trade agreement or similar forms of economic integration eventually leading to a " common continental market . "
" we should be frank about it : the global economic crisis has revealed both russia and the eu to be economically very vulnerable , " putin wrote .
russia , he argued , was still too dependent on its energy exports , while the eu was in danger of jeopardizing its position on the international markets , due to a decrease in its industrial productivity .
" what 's on the agenda : how can we trigger a new wave of industrialization to roll across europe , " putin wrote .
different takes on energy cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' both russia and the eu have been shown to be economically very vulnerable ' : putin he suggested strategic alliances in key industries , including shipbuilding , car manufacturing , space exploration and the pharmaceutical industry .
energy policy , putin wrote , was another field where closer cooperation was needed .
from nuclear technology to gas and oil exploitation , there was a need for closer ties with brussels .
the european union gets around 25 percent of its natural gas from russia .
in the past , however , brussels has left little doubt that it wants to diversify its energy supply to reduce dependency on russia .
interruptions to the supply have in recent years lead to energy shortages in several eu member states .
putin also called for easing and eventually lifting visa restrictions between the eu and russia .
this , he wrote , would bring about not the end but rather the beginning of true integration between his country and the 27-nation bloc .
putin 's comments preceded his visit to germany , which starts on thursday .
he is scheduled to meet with german chancellor angela merkel on friday .
merkel , meanwhile , has downplayed the chances of a possible free trade zone .
speaking to reporters in berlin on thursday , she pointed to russian high tariffs and moscow 's trade relations with neighboring countries as potential stumbling blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas transit interruptions have led to tensions with moscow " of course we support the idea of a free trade zone between the eu and russia but i have to pour a bit of cold water on it , " she said .
" the steps that russia has taken recently do not point in that direction . "
she pointed out that russia , not yet part of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , has established trade ties with kazakhstan and belarus , countries whose statuses as potential wto members are far less certain than russia 's .
eon , gazprom on the agenda merkel and putin are also expected to discuss german energy company eon possibly selling its shares in russia 's gazprom .
media reports on wednesday suggested eon plans to drop the 3.5 percent stake it holds in the russian energy giant .
eon had dismissed reports that it would sell its 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- in shares , while a government spokesman in berlin confirmed the issue was on the agenda of the merkel-putin talks .
the eu is russia 's largest trading partner , making up about one half of its foreign trade .
total trade in the first half of the year was $ 141.9 billion -lrb- 106.3 billion euros -rrb- , according to the russian federal customs agency .

yet financial markets remain nervous , fearing that spain and portugal may be next in line for eu aid . eu commissioner for economic and monetary affairs olli rehn has applauded ireland 's 15-billion-euro -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- austerity package as " a sound basis for the negotiations " on an international bailout . ireland has set out a four-year plan to save the 15 billion euros in order to secure an international bailout expected to be in the region of 85 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts do not necessarily share olli rehn 's confidence under the national recovery plan , the irish republic aims to bring its budget deficit down from a projected 32 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to three percent of gdp by 2014 by imposing tax increases , wage cuts and by curbing public spending .
irish prime minister brian cowen conceded that the average living standard in his country was likely to suffer as a result of the severe cuts .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicholas sarkozy were said to be " impressed " with the recovery program , after discussing the situation in ireland by telephone on thursday .
a statement from the chancellor 's office added that both leaders " agreed that negotiations with the irish government must be rapidly concluded . " 85 billion - or more the drastic austerity measures are the condition for ireland to receive help from eu funds .
cowen has given 85 billion euros as the sum that his country would need , but negotiations with brussels and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- are still ongoing .
experts , however , warn that more money could be needed to avoid the former celtic tiger from sliding into bankruptcy .
constantin gurdgiev , an economist at trinity college in dublin , said the situation was even worse than in greece .
" our economy has more than three times more debt .
if greece is bankrupt - what then are we ? " he asked .
in the wake of the crisis in ireland international financial markets are getting increasingly nervous about portugal and spain .
both countries are feared to be the next possible candidates in need of an eu bailout .
" there 's nothing that politics can do to ease that tension on the markets , " lueder gerken , head of the center for european policy , told the neue rhein zeitung daily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : portugal is expected by many to be the next eu country in need of help from brussels " of course there will be a domino effect - regardless of what 'll happen in ireland .
the markets have already set their eyes on portugal , and spain too looks to be set for trouble , " he added .
portugal , spain insist they wo n't be next herman van rompuy , head of the eu council , is trying to calm those concerns .
he said that any fears of a repeat of the irish crisis in portugal were baseless .
portugal 's debt was lower , there was n't a real estate crisis there , and the banks had enough capital reserves , van rompuy said .
" all that talk has neither an economic nor a rational basis . "
portuguese prime minister jose socrates also tried to reassure the public that his country would not need any eu help .
but his government 's plans for tough austerity measures have met with strong opposition , strikes and demonstrations - and a one-day general strike on tuesday .
spain , too , tried to dismiss fears that it would soon need eu aid .
" we are worlds apart from ireland , " deputy economics minister jose manual campa said .
unlike ireland , spain was a country with a comparatively low deficit and already in the process of consolidation , he added .
yet experts are somewhat less optimistic than madrid .
unemployment in spain has reached 20 percent , and economic growth is stagnating .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 25.11.2010 france plans to introduce new ' google tax ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris thinks google could contribute more to french coffers the french senate has approved a new tax on online advertising services offered by internet giants such as google .
but critics say the plan misses the point and burdens domestic companies instead . as online advertising continues to grow rapidly throughout europe , french senators this week approved a new tax law aimed at securing the government to a piece of the revenue pie .
although the measure is popularly known as the " google tax " , it does not directly impact the internet giant , which has based its advertising business offshore and out of reach of french tax collectors .
instead , the one-percent charge will be levied on all french-based companies purchasing online publicity services .
the measure is expected to become law in 2011 and generate between 10 and 20 million euros per year if it is passed by the national assembly , as predicted .
supporters of the tax say it will put online advertising on an equality footing with other media .
broadcast and print advertisements are already subject to taxation in france .
television advertising alone pumps roughly 70 million euros into government coffers annually .
but critics say the government 's plan fails to meet its original goal : to tax the french operations of internet giants such as google , microsoft , ebay and amazon , which are located strategically in european countries with low corporate tax rates , such as ireland and luxembourg .
french business leaders fear the measure will burden small advertisers and lead to an exodus of larger internet stakeholders from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original goal of the levy was to tax offshore internet giants ' profits according to iab europe – an umbrella organization representing national trade associations for digital and interactive marketing – france 's online advertising market is europe 's third largest after the united kingdom and germany .
in 2009 , the uk market was worth 4 billion euros , the german market worth 3 billion , and the french market worth 1.7 billion .
kimon zorbas , vice president of iab europe , says the proposed law is shortsighted in that it hits french companies while giving their foreign competitors a break .
" our position is that this is a market which is already less than half the size of the english market .
france has a lot of catching up to do , and such a tax on a developing market is doubly negative , " he told deutsche welle .
" any tax is bound to have an effect on the market .
naturally the question now is how big of an effect , and that 's something we ca n't yet know . "
pattern of intervention recently , a distinctly french approach to the economic and cultural challenges presented by the internet has emerged .
in october the country announced a subsidy system under which young people can buy partially subsidized cards to purchase and download music with .
the program is intended to encourage the legal downloading of music over internet piracy .
it has also begun to send piracy warnings via email to illegal file sharers .
and in november france extended its 1981 lang law – which lets publishers set book prices and forbids booksellers from giving more than a 5 percent discount – to apply to e-books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy 's government has been grappling with internet issues karin von abrams , a london-based analyst for emarketer , tracks the french market and says that while governments are generally " very wary of hindering " the growth of online markets , it 's not surprising that france would seek to tax them .
" france has a history of very deliberate federal supervision of – and sometimes intervention in – the media , " she told deutsche welle .
" they also have a very strong history of federal subsidies for culture … they see inequalities developing , and are perhaps more likely to intervene because of their historical attitudes in this respect . "
zorbas added that specialized national taxes could create disunity among european nations trying to increase their combined market share , and that attempts to create boundaries in the internet " just ca n't work out . "

so-called " ghost estates " now blight the republic , with many homes left unoccupied or unfinished . ask a taxi driver in dublin to take you to a " ghost estate , " and a kind one will point out that you can walk there and do n't actually need a cab .
there are several examples of unfinished or largely unoccupied housing developments in the irish capital , one of which is called spencer dock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while there may be lots of housing , there are few real homes spencer dock 's developers say the project will be completed and residency rates will rise , but it is currently far emptier than they would like , and stationary cranes dot the landscape with unfinished buildings breaking the skyline . apart from the main road a street away , there is little activity - the sound of children playing outside is rarely heard , for example , according to those people who have taken up residence .
there is also a shiny new tram line , but very few people waiting to use it .
it is hard to find irish residents living in this development off the banks of the river liffey and just outside the center of dublin .
mikaela ekman moved here from sweden .
she acknowledged the strange atmosphere in the largely empty neighborhood .
" yeah , it 's very half finished ! " she said , laughing and pointing to the cranes around nearby buildings .
spencer dock 's developers have even had to launch legal action against customers who agreed to buy property on the site but have changed their mind in view of plummeting home values and low residency .
a problem not confined to dublin there are far too many buildings for people in ireland , according to brendan williams , a lecturer in urban development at university college dublin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williams says housing supply vastly outstrips demand " we estimate that the overproduction or oversupply in the housing area is approximately 17 percent ; in other areas , such as commercial and offices , it 's of the order of 20 percent , " he said .
" there is also an oversupply in other sectors as well , such as hotels . "
williams says construction continued at a rapid pace in the irish republic long after signs appeared that the economy was cooling , with disastrous effects for irish banks that invested heavily in the housing boom .
" in a general sense , there was an oversupply and an overbuilding that continued largely through the period 2004-2009 , which contributed , obviously , to the eventual failure of the property market . "
nearly 100,000 homes were built in 2006 alone .
williams said house prices have crashed by as much as 50 percent from their peak .
that has wiped billions of euros off the balance sheets of the banks .
what now for ghost estates ?
it 's not clear exactly how many homes are unoccupied across ireland .
some estimates put the figure as high as 300,000 .
what is clear is that for the few residents who live in the ghost estates , life can be miserable .
some have such low occupancy rates that shopkeepers have declined to open in the area ; on some one side of the road is finished , while the other is not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steven lewis is very aware of the problems of living on a ghost estate steven lewis is one of those who has chosen to live on what he himself describes as a ghost estate just outside dublin .
he has done so because rent is cheap , but admits there is a downside .
" i 've had my car broken into three times this year , " he said , acknowledging the problems with crime on estates where little pride is felt by residents for their unfinished surroundings .
steven sympathizes with those people who actually bought property where he lives .
" my heart goes out to working class families that have bought a home , and they open up their windows and they see a half-finished house across the road from them , " he said .
" they 're now developing sewerage problems and all sorts of other health issues .
my heart seriously goes out to these people because they ca n't move on now . "
a need to face up to reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are new tram connections , but few passengers to use them the solution to these problems is one that may be unpalatable to banks , developers and property owners alike .
williams says that people need to acknowledge the realities of vast oversupply and start selling unoccupied properties in ghost estates at vastly knocked-down prices .
but there 's another looming problem that could make such steps immaterial : with tens of thousands of people expected to leave ireland in the coming years because of its economic problems , excess supply in the housing market may yet worsen further .

but critics say the plan misses the point and burdens domestic companies instead . as online advertising continues to grow rapidly throughout europe , french senators this week approved a new tax law aimed at securing the government to a piece of the revenue pie .
although the measure is popularly known as the " google tax " , it does not directly impact the internet giant , which has based its advertising business offshore and out of reach of french tax collectors .
instead , the one-percent charge will be levied on all french-based companies purchasing online publicity services .
the measure is expected to become law in 2011 and generate between 10 and 20 million euros per year if it is passed by the national assembly , as predicted .
supporters of the tax say it will put online advertising on an equality footing with other media .
broadcast and print advertisements are already subject to taxation in france .
television advertising alone pumps roughly 70 million euros into government coffers annually .
but critics say the government 's plan fails to meet its original goal : to tax the french operations of internet giants such as google , microsoft , ebay and amazon , which are located strategically in european countries with low corporate tax rates , such as ireland and luxembourg .
french business leaders fear the measure will burden small advertisers and lead to an exodus of larger internet stakeholders from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original goal of the levy was to tax offshore internet giants ' profits according to iab europe – an umbrella organization representing national trade associations for digital and interactive marketing – france 's online advertising market is europe 's third largest after the united kingdom and germany .
in 2009 , the uk market was worth 4 billion euros , the german market worth 3 billion , and the french market worth 1.7 billion .
kimon zorbas , vice president of iab europe , says the proposed law is shortsighted in that it hits french companies while giving their foreign competitors a break .
" our position is that this is a market which is already less than half the size of the english market .
france has a lot of catching up to do , and such a tax on a developing market is doubly negative , " he told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de champions league -pipe- 25.11.2010 schalke 's confidence soars in europe while bremen plumbs new depths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could raul and schalke be about to take flight in europe ?
schalke 04 joined bayern munich in the last 16 of the champions league after a confident 3-0 win over lyon which hinted at a long-awaited return to form .
meanwhile , werder bremen continue to plumb the depths of despair . a team which had been struggling with a new faces and new tactics suddenly finds its feet in november , begins climbing the rungs in the bundesliga and marches in to the knockout stage of the champions league .
sound familiar ?
the story of bayern munich 's rise last season began , in some ways , like the unfolding tale of schalke 04 's campaign this time around .
bayern may never have flirted with the drop zone , but they began the season far off the pace .
right around the time christmas markets began opening up across the land , however , they found their rhythm - and built up the head of steam which carried them to their very successful end .
it remains fanciful to believe that schalke ’ s recent rampant form will be the start of a rise from the bottom to the top , resulting in schalke snatching the title in may , but it certainly appears - like bayern before them - that november is the month in which this schalke team began to click .
europe becomes schalke 's playground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huntelaar -lrb- m . -rrb- scored twice in schalke 's win over lyon schalke , in contrast to their wretched league from , have played well in europe nearly from the outset .
after a blip in their first group game at lyon , they have since won three and drawn one , a run of results which has seen them qualify for the knock-out rounds with a game to spare .
they could even go through as group winners .
wednesday night 's performance at home to lyon was the strongest indicator yet that schalke have turned a corner .
the team 's movement and one-touch passing was of such quality that it was hard to believe they were the same group that had sunk so desperately low in the bundesliga .
this was a truly european performance , with jefferson farfan and jose manuel jurado showing ingenuity and pace enough to rip the french defense to shreds .
raul , meanwhile , showed a growing belief in his new team , and klaas jan huntelaar 's rediscovered scoring touch can only bode well for the coming weeks .
schalke looked like they knew exactly what to do , and precisely what coach felix magath wanted from them .
even the royal blues ' defense , which has been shaky at best for most of the season , gave a commanding performance ; the much-maligned christoph metzelder and benedikt hoewedes in particular gave towering displays to cut out the threat from lyon 's ordinarily potent offense led by yoann gourcuff and lisandro lopez .
magath will now have confidence that his jigsaw is finally settling in place and that schalke can continue their climb out of the lower reaches of the bundesliga while progressing with flair in europe .
bremen in crisis as confidence goes awol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down and out : bremen 's loss to spurs ended their hopes werder bremen coach thomas schaaf has it worse - much worse .
taken apart by schalke last weekend in the league and dumped out of europe by tottenham hotspur on wednesday night , the north german club look destined to spend the remaining months of the season engaged in a fight for belief , if not survival , while felix magath 's side rub shoulders with the likes of barcelona , real madrid and manchester united .
bremen look such a broken team that it 's hard to see where any kind of recovery will come from .
the team werder sent out at white hart lane on wednesday was a mix of shell-shocked veterans and overwhelmed reserves who were getting a game only because of the team ’ s injury woes .
tottenham were 2-0 up at half time , but the way the beleaguered bremen squad left the pitch at the interval , they may as well have stayed in the locker room and taken the forfeit .
-lrb- the game did end 3-0 , as it happened . -rrb-
in the end , it did n't matter what the deficit was - werder were eliminated from the champions league .
moreover , they would need to beat european champions inter milan in their final group game , and make up a seven goal difference on fc twente to even have a chance of a place in the europa league place .
in other words , it ’ s not happening .
bremen have a north german derby on sunday against fc st. pauli which would usually be billed as a david and goliath clash .
on recent form though , it 's hard to say which is the skinny boy with the sling .
bremen 's response to dropping out of european competition for another season at home to pauli this weekend may determine their season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 25.11.2010 netherlands issue arrest warrant for nazi criminal living in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faber has so far managed to escape justice dutch public prosecutors have issued an arrest warrant for convicted nazi criminal klaas carel faber to be extradited to the netherlands .
faber escaped a dutch prison in 1952 and has since lived a quiet life in germany . authorities in the netherlands have issued a european arrest warrant for a convicted nazi war criminal living in germany .
dutch-born klaas carel faber had been sentenced to death by a netherlands court in 1947 for the murder of several prisoners in the westerbork transit camp in 1944 .
the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1948 .
faber escaped from prison in 1952 .
he fled across the border to west germany , where he later received citizenship , and moved to bavaria .
faber served in a special ss death squad that was tasked with killing dutch civilians classified as " anti-german " or linked to dutch resistance in the german-occupied netherlands .
the 88-year old is high on the simon wiesenthal center 's list of wanted nazi criminals .
the israeli government has also repeatedly called for him to be brought to justice .
extradition request to follow berlin , however , has so far refused to extradite him .
in 1957 a court in dusseldorf dismissed charges against faber for lack of evidence brought against him .
a dutch extradition request in 2004 was turned down with reference to that 1957 decision .
in 2006 new evidence was brought before a court in munich , but the judges saw the cases as manslaughter rather than murder - which meant the crimes had lapsed under the statute of limitations .
in order to re-examine the case with new evidence , a new arrest warrant from dutch authorities was needed .
dutch public prosecutors are for the first time trying to use the european arrest warrant system , which has been in place since 2002 .
the arrest warrant for faber is a preliminary step before the formal extradition request to germany .

girls are subjected to fgm for a variety of reasons , explained christine loudes , director of the endfgm campaign at amnesty international .
" fgm is performed for non-therapeutic reasons , " loudes said .
" it 's done in the name of tradition , in the name of aesthetics and sometimes in the name of religion . "
fgm involves partially or completely removing the external female genitalia , and the practice is usually performed under unhygienic conditions and without anaesthesia on girls from their birth to 15 years of age .
fgm represents a severe violation of human rights .
" it constitutes torture and degrading treatment ; it violates women 's rights , and it violates rights to physical integrity as well as to children 's rights , to name a few , " loudes added .
fgm crosses borders africa is the most notable perpetrator regarding fgm , with some 30 countries subjecting girls to the practice .
but girls are threatened by the practice on other continents as well .
according to the european parliament , roughly 500,000 girls and women in europe have already been subjected to fgm or are in danger of becoming victims .
that number includes 75,000 girls and women in the uk , 65,000 in france and 30,000 in germany .
as loudes explains , it 's difficult to prove that fgm is actually being carried out on the ground in europe , but amnesty international does not want to rule out the possibility .
" i can not say that it 's hard evidence .
there 's anecdotal evidence that this is done in europe and that actually there is a cross-border dimension to it , " loudes said .
" but mostly we know that it 's happening when girls are going with their parents on holiday to their parents ' country of origin , and that 's where they are most at risk . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fgm is usually carried out under unhygienic conditions and without anaesthesia one fgm victim living in europe is aissatou diallo , a native of guinea who was mutilated in her home country at the age of 14 .
fearing that her own daughters might meet the same fate , the family came to belgium in 2007 as refugees .
diallo says she now lives with a sense of security .
" i 've noticed that since coming to belgium i 've had peace of mind , because my children go to school and they are safe here , " diallo said .
" i do n't come home and ask , ‘ where are my girls ?
did someone take them away to cut them ? ' , which is what often happens in my country .
so here i 've been able to enjoy life again , and i 've learned to rebuild myself psychologically . "
diallo may have found her footing in belgium , but christine loudes says that the recovery process is long and demanding for fgm victims who arrive in europe .
" they need a lot of healthcare support , " she stressed .
" in particular , some form of reparation is required for women whose vagina has been stitched together .
these women will need to be unstitched and they will need psychological support because it 's a practice that brings a lot of psychological and physical trauma . "
support for victims and health professionals run by amnesty international in coordination with non-government organizations in 11 different european countries , the endfgm campaign has set accessible healthcare for fgm victims living in europe as a priority .
in germany , for example , there is still work to be done in achieving this goal .
" the treatment and the operations needed for fgm victims are not covered by health insurance here , " explained shewa sium , director of the cologne-based refugee support organization agisra .
" the women have to pay for it themselves .
right now , we 're collecting signatures for a petition so that medical treatment for victims of fgm can also be covered by insurance companies . "
but it 's not just the fgm victims who need support .
organizations like amnesty international and agisra are calling on eu member states to give government workers the resources and training they need to tackle an issue they are unlikely to have encountered before .
" we hear a lot of health professionals , teachers and social workers are confronted with the practice , and they do n't know how to deal with the situation , " said christine loudes .
" the most difficult moment is at the time of giving birth , during which there is a lot of risk for the mother and the baby .
the fact that health professionals are not used to dealing with women who have undergone fgm means that there is often an emergency caesarean section .
this leads to increased costs in the health system as well as a higher risk for the women . "
because fgm has a lifelong physical and psychological impact on its victims , organizations like amnesty international also emphasize the need to protect girls and women at risk , often via asylum in europe .
the european union , however , lacks unified procedures and legislation when it comes to fgm .
" what is problematic is that each member state has a very different approach in relation to fgm , " explains loudes .
" in some cases it is recognized as persecution , and in other cases you get another status that is less protective and is only temporary .
in some countries , the level of awareness is very low , in particular in the new countries that have joined the eu .
we are trying to change this by providing some education to asylum officers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls are usually subjected to fgm between infancy and 15 years of age eu countries must act , says commisssion in an effort to achieve a streamlined , forceful approach against fgm from eu member states , the european commission is also taking steps .
viviane reding , the justice and fundamental rights commissioner , has flagged fgm as an issue in a five-year strategy for equality between women and men , and the commission may further target fgm in a new policy paper due out in february 2011 .
" the commission is going to come out with a strategy policy paper on violence in general and victims .
fgm is one of the priorities for the commission , " said mathew newman , spokesperson for commissioner reding .
" it 's possible that we will include it in the victims ' strategy .
it 's a horrible practice , and people need to know that .
they also need to know that the european union is working with member states to raise awareness and doing everything we can to stop it . "
while the eu 's efforts are welcome news for women like aissatou diallo , she cautions that european countries and their citizens must also treat the issue of fgm with sensitivity to avoid stigmatizing its victims .
" when we talk about terrible things that others do n't understand , we simply need to tell them : it 's as if you would take a child in europe and cut off an ear , an arm , or an eye .
the child has been mutilated ; it 's as simple as that , " she explained .
" it 's true that we 're not seen as complete women .
we 're seen as handicapped , almost .
but we are people like you , and as africans , we are fighting for change .
our hope is to be the last women in the world who have suffered from this practice . "

girls are subjected to fgm for a variety of reasons , explained christine loudes , director of the endfgm campaign at amnesty international .
" fgm is performed for non-therapeutic reasons , " loudes said .
" it 's done in the name of tradition , in the name of aesthetics and sometimes in the name of religion . "
fgm involves partially or completely removing the external female genitalia , and the practice is usually performed under unhygienic conditions and without anaesthesia on girls from their birth to 15 years of age .
fgm represents a severe violation of human rights .
" it constitutes torture and degrading treatment ; it violates women 's rights , and it violates rights to physical integrity as well as to children 's rights , to name a few , " loudes added .
fgm crosses borders africa is the most notable perpetrator regarding fgm , with some 30 countries subjecting girls to the practice .
but girls are threatened by the practice on other continents as well .
according to the european parliament , roughly 500,000 girls and women in europe have already been subjected to fgm or are in danger of becoming victims .
that number includes 75,000 girls and women in the uk , 65,000 in france and 30,000 in germany .
as loudes explains , it 's difficult to prove that fgm is actually being carried out on the ground in europe , but amnesty international does not want to rule out the possibility .
" i can not say that it 's hard evidence .
there 's anecdotal evidence that this is done in europe and that actually there is a cross-border dimension to it , " loudes said .
" but mostly we know that it 's happening when girls are going with their parents on holiday to their parents ' country of origin , and that 's where they are most at risk . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fgm is usually carried out under unhygienic conditions and without anaesthesia one fgm victim living in europe is aissatou diallo , a native of guinea who was mutilated in her home country at the age of 14 .
fearing that her own daughters might meet the same fate , the family came to belgium in 2007 as refugees .
diallo says she now lives with a sense of security .
" i 've noticed that since coming to belgium i 've had peace of mind , because my children go to school and they are safe here , " diallo said .
" i do n't come home and ask , ‘ where are my girls ?
did someone take them away to cut them ? ' , which is what often happens in my country .
so here i 've been able to enjoy life again , and i 've learned to rebuild myself psychologically . "
diallo may have found her footing in belgium , but christine loudes says that the recovery process is long and demanding for fgm victims who arrive in europe .
" they need a lot of healthcare support , " she stressed .
" in particular , some form of reparation is required for women whose vagina has been stitched together .
these women will need to be unstitched and they will need psychological support because it 's a practice that brings a lot of psychological and physical trauma . "
support for victims and health professionals run by amnesty international in coordination with non-government organizations in 11 different european countries , the endfgm campaign has set accessible healthcare for fgm victims living in europe as a priority .
in germany , for example , there is still work to be done in achieving this goal .
" the treatment and the operations needed for fgm victims are not covered by health insurance here , " explained shewa sium , director of the cologne-based refugee support organization agisra .
" the women have to pay for it themselves .
right now , we 're collecting signatures for a petition so that medical treatment for victims of fgm can also be covered by insurance companies . "
but it 's not just the fgm victims who need support .
organizations like amnesty international and agisra are calling on eu member states to give government workers the resources and training they need to tackle an issue they are unlikely to have encountered before .
" we hear a lot of health professionals , teachers and social workers are confronted with the practice , and they do n't know how to deal with the situation , " said christine loudes .
" the most difficult moment is at the time of giving birth , during which there is a lot of risk for the mother and the baby .
the fact that health professionals are not used to dealing with women who have undergone fgm means that there is often an emergency caesarean section .
this leads to increased costs in the health system as well as a higher risk for the women . "
because fgm has a lifelong physical and psychological impact on its victims , organizations like amnesty international also emphasize the need to protect girls and women at risk , often via asylum in europe .
the european union , however , lacks unified procedures and legislation when it comes to fgm .
" what is problematic is that each member state has a very different approach in relation to fgm , " explains loudes .
" in some cases it is recognized as persecution , and in other cases you get another status that is less protective and is only temporary .
in some countries , the level of awareness is very low , in particular in the new countries that have joined the eu .
we are trying to change this by providing some education to asylum officers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girls are usually subjected to fgm between infancy and 15 years of age eu countries must act , says commisssion in an effort to achieve a streamlined , forceful approach against fgm from eu member states , the european commission is also taking steps .
viviane reding , the justice and fundamental rights commissioner , has flagged fgm as an issue in a five-year strategy for equality between women and men , and the commission may further target fgm in a new policy paper due out in february 2011 .
" the commission is going to come out with a strategy policy paper on violence in general and victims .
fgm is one of the priorities for the commission , " said mathew newman , spokesperson for commissioner reding .
" it 's possible that we will include it in the victims ' strategy .
it 's a horrible practice , and people need to know that .
they also need to know that the european union is working with member states to raise awareness and doing everything we can to stop it . "
while the eu 's efforts are welcome news for women like aissatou diallo , she cautions that european countries and their citizens must also treat the issue of fgm with sensitivity to avoid stigmatizing its victims .
" when we talk about terrible things that others do n't understand , we simply need to tell them : it 's as if you would take a child in europe and cut off an ear , an arm , or an eye .
the child has been mutilated ; it 's as simple as that , " she explained .
" it 's true that we 're not seen as complete women .
we 're seen as handicapped , almost .
but we are people like you , and as africans , we are fighting for change .
our hope is to be the last women in the world who have suffered from this practice . "

so-called " ghost estates " now blight the republic , with many homes left unoccupied or unfinished . ask a taxi driver in dublin to take you to a " ghost estate , " and a kind one will point out that you can walk there and do n't actually need a cab .
there are several examples of unfinished or largely unoccupied housing developments in the irish capital , one of which is called spencer dock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while there may be lots of housing , there are few real homes spencer dock 's developers say the project will be completed and residency rates will rise , but it is currently far emptier than they would like , and stationary cranes dot the landscape with unfinished buildings breaking the skyline . apart from the main road a street away , there is little activity - the sound of children playing outside is rarely heard , for example , according to those people who have taken up residence .
there is also a shiny new tram line , but very few people waiting to use it .
it is hard to find irish residents living in this development off the banks of the river liffey and just outside the center of dublin .
mikaela ekman moved here from sweden .
she acknowledged the strange atmosphere in the largely empty neighborhood .
" yeah , it 's very half finished ! " she said , laughing and pointing to the cranes around nearby buildings .
spencer dock 's developers have even had to launch legal action against customers who agreed to buy property on the site but have changed their mind in view of plummeting home values and low residency .
a problem not confined to dublin there are far too many buildings for people in ireland , according to brendan williams , a lecturer in urban development at university college dublin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williams says housing supply vastly outstrips demand " we estimate that the overproduction or oversupply in the housing area is approximately 17 percent ; in other areas , such as commercial and offices , it 's of the order of 20 percent , " he said .
" there is also an oversupply in other sectors as well , such as hotels . "
williams says construction continued at a rapid pace in the irish republic long after signs appeared that the economy was cooling , with disastrous effects for irish banks that invested heavily in the housing boom .
" in a general sense , there was an oversupply and an overbuilding that continued largely through the period 2004-2009 , which contributed , obviously , to the eventual failure of the property market . "
nearly 100,000 homes were built in 2006 alone .
williams said house prices have crashed by as much as 50 percent from their peak .
that has wiped billions of euros off the balance sheets of the banks .
what now for ghost estates ?
it 's not clear exactly how many homes are unoccupied across ireland .
some estimates put the figure as high as 300,000 .
what is clear is that for the few residents who live in the ghost estates , life can be miserable .
some have such low occupancy rates that shopkeepers have declined to open in the area ; on some one side of the road is finished , while the other is not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steven lewis is very aware of the problems of living on a ghost estate steven lewis is one of those who has chosen to live on what he himself describes as a ghost estate just outside dublin .
he has done so because rent is cheap , but admits there is a downside .
" i 've had my car broken into three times this year , " he said , acknowledging the problems with crime on estates where little pride is felt by residents for their unfinished surroundings .
steven sympathizes with those people who actually bought property where he lives .
" my heart goes out to working class families that have bought a home , and they open up their windows and they see a half-finished house across the road from them , " he said .
" they 're now developing sewerage problems and all sorts of other health issues .
my heart seriously goes out to these people because they ca n't move on now . "
a need to face up to reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are new tram connections , but few passengers to use them the solution to these problems is one that may be unpalatable to banks , developers and property owners alike .
williams says that people need to acknowledge the realities of vast oversupply and start selling unoccupied properties in ghost estates at vastly knocked-down prices .
but there 's another looming problem that could make such steps immaterial : with tens of thousands of people expected to leave ireland in the coming years because of its economic problems , excess supply in the housing market may yet worsen further .

but the opposition thinks not everyone is benefitting from the boom . just in time for the christmas , it seems german consumers are rediscovering the joys of shopping .
speaking to the lower house of the german parliament on thursday , economics minister rainer bruederle said domestic demand was on the upswing and stronger than expected , as consumers were once again feeling comfortable enough to go out and spend .
" we 're consuming again , people are doing well and people are spending again , " said bruederle , calling the economic upswing like something " out of a fairy tale . "
germany 's gross domestic product is expected to grow by about 3.5 percent this year , nearing a two-decade high , and by 2.6 percent in 2011 .
bruederle said under the governing center-right coalition of the christian democrats and the liberal free democrats , germany has become the economic model for all of europe , adding that the country could expect to enjoy its current economic growth for the foreseeable future .
the market research firm gfk said consumer morale rose more than expected in november , for the sixth month in a row .
and german business sentiment rose to its strongest level since 1991 in november , according to the ifo economic think tank .
in october , unemployment fell to an 18-year low , dropping below three million for the first time since november 2008 .
bruederle is convinced that full employment could soon be a possibility , adding that in many regions in the south of the country this was already a reality .

garrelt duin , of the spd , said the economic upswing was not stable or balanced .
he said both domestic investment and wages needed to increase , to support the increased domestic demand .
michael schlecht of the left party pointed out that while businesses were enjoying a growth in profits of up to 40 percent , wages had hardly followed suit .
he said that since 2000 , businesses had seen incomes increase by at least 50 percent , but the income of the average worker has actually dropped .
schlecht also said austerity programs in other european union countries , such as greece and ireland , would have a negative trickledown effect on german exports , on which germany has traditionally relied to support its growth .
he called for a reversal of the reforms to the “ hartz iv ” welfare subsidy program and for the introduction of a set minimum wage of 10 euros -lrb- $ 13.4 -rrb- per hour , to shore up the domestic growth sector .

at the end of world war ii , she was living in bucharest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : author regine beyer spent 10 years interviewing peggy stone in new york new beginning in new york by the early 50s , peggy had re-located once again , this time to israel , but with few opportunities to perform available in the fledgling state , she packed her bags and moved for what would be the last time .
in 1953 , new york would become her permanent home but , by now in her late 40s , her career as a performer was over and she moved instead into the fashion industry working as a successful copyist .
it was here in the late 90s that author regine beyer met stone and began to record her life story , determined one day to turn it into a biography .
britta juergs from the aviva publishing house also fell for stone 's story and agreed to produce the book .
" maybe she 's not so famous , but she 's such an interesting woman , " she said , " in the book we have lots of original peggy .
there are parts of regine and there are parts of peggy stone and i think that 's really great to hear her because she had lots and lots of humor and it 's great to read . "
despite her contribution to the entertainment world and widespread popularity in her day , peggy stone has faded into relative obscurity ; partly because she was n't political or ground-breaking and also because she was active at a time when women had fewer opportunities than men to be recorded and preserved for posterity .
in 10 years of researching her subject , regine beyer was unable to unearth a single professional audio recording of peggy stone performing .
a natural optimist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beyer 's new biography of stone now , the public has an opportunity to rediscover the world of peggy stone and her biographer and friend regine beyer wants them to remember her " as a woman who lived through very difficult times , who complained very little , who stood up to the reality , who tried to live her life the best she could and who also had a real great knack for putting people in touch from very different backgrounds . "
" she was a people 's person and she was always believing in life and that 's a great message , " added beyer .

irish prime minister brian cowen conceded that the average living standard in his country was likely to suffer as a result of the severe cuts .
german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicholas sarkozy were said to be " impressed " with the recovery program , after discussing the situation in ireland by telephone on thursday .
a statement from the chancellor 's office added that both leaders " agreed that negotiations with the irish government must be rapidly concluded . " 85 billion - or more the drastic austerity measures are the condition for ireland to receive help from eu funds .
cowen has given 85 billion euros as the sum that his country would need , but negotiations with brussels and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- are still ongoing .

portugal , spain insist they wo n't be next herman van rompuy , head of the eu council , is trying to calm those concerns .
he said that any fears of a repeat of the irish crisis in portugal were baseless .
portugal 's debt was lower , there was n't a real estate crisis there , and the banks had enough capital reserves , van rompuy said .
" all that talk has neither an economic nor a rational basis . "
portuguese prime minister jose socrates also tried to reassure the public that his country would not need any eu help .
but his government 's plans for tough austerity measures have met with strong opposition , strikes and demonstrations - and a one-day general strike on tuesday .
spain , too , tried to dismiss fears that it would soon need eu aid .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . nikolaus is coming he may look similar to santa claus , but he is not quite the same thing .
in germany , saint nicholas - known as nikolaus - also has a white beard and carries a sack full of presents on his back , but he visits children in the wee hours of december 6 .
this date is not incidental , as december 6 is when people called nikolaus celebrate their name day in germany , in honor of the saint 's birthday . the story behind the event goes back to the third and fourth century ad .
saint nicholas - originally known as nikolaos of myra - was a greek bishop .
he had a reputation for gift-giving , which is why he also became the model for santa claus .
he is also known as the patron saint of children . in germany , kids eagerly await nikolaus each year .
they traditionally put a boot outside the front door on the evening of december 5 , expecting saint nicholas to fill it with gifts and sweets while they sleep .
this crucial part is usually performed by the parents , of course , but they like to make their children believe that saint nicholas rewards those who have been good and polite throughout the year . on the other hand , the german equivalent of santa claus - called weihnachtsmann -lrb- christmas man -rrb- - comes on christmas eve , along with the christkind -lrb- christ child -rrb- who is also a traditional gift-bringer in germany and other parts of central europe .
the figure of the christkind goes back to the times of martin luther , who , in line with his protestant teachings , discouraged the worship of saints , including saint nicholas . bildunterschrift : both nikolaus and santa claus were based on the same early christian saint results of the latest education study how good is the german education system ?
when the first pisa -lrb- programme for international student assessment -rrb- study came out in 2001 - a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school students ' scholastic performance - germany did not score particularly well .
the country 's media used terms like " pisa shock " to reflect the general disappointment . the study has been carried out every three years since then , with the latest results , due to be released on december 7 , focusing on reading abilities .
however , there is some controversy about how accurately the study really reflects the quality of an education system .
some critics point out that a student 's performance is influenced by many factors , and so it can not be explained by the quality of the school system alone . nevertheless , since the study came into existence , many are looking toward finland for guidance , as this northern european nation regularly scores excellent marks in pisa .
some believe that the german school system may be at fault after all .
the german tradition of dividing students into different types of high schools based on their academic performance has already been disputed and debated for quite some time .
and the pisa study only helps to fan the flames of this debate . big names on the big screen a much talked-about new movie by florian henckel von donnersmarck , " the tourist , " debuts in german movie theaters on december 16 .
the director won the academy award for best foreign language film in 2007 for his east-germany-based drama " the lives of others . " the film , which features hollywood stars angelina jolie and johnny depp in the main roles , is a thriller set in venice about an american tourist -lrb- depp -rrb- who is used by an english woman -lrb- jolie -rrb- in an attempt to mislead those following her criminal ex-lover . bildunterschrift : angelina jolie und johnny depp star in " the tourist " napoleon exhibition talking about your country 's history is not always easy - the germans know this all too well .
in the case of france , this problem relates to its former ruler and military leader napoleon bonaparte .
many french people are not proud of his imperialistic conquests and demonstrations of power , so it is not easy to organize an exhibition on the topic in his homeland , according to the spokesperson for the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany in bonn . from december 17 , the art and exhibition hall will host the exhibition " napoleon and europe .
dream and trauma , " which aims to explain who napoleon really was and how he rose to power .
items on display include original documents , paintings and everyday objects .
the exhibition 's curator is french scholar benedicte savoy , who teaches art history at the berlin institute of technology .
the exhibition will travel to france in march next year .
bildunterschrift : the exhibition features paintings depicting the life of napoleon , including battle scenes merry christmas and happy new year in germany , advent marks the countdown to christmas , which celebrates the birth of jesus christ .
during this time , an advent wreath decorates the tables in many german households .
this tradition can be traced back to johann hinrich wichern , a 19th-century german protestant pastor , who invented the wreath to make the advent time seem shorter for children , since they could light one candle in it each day . some theaters in germany offer a special advent program , where on each of the days between december 1 and december 24 -lrb- christmas eve -rrb- a little " door " is opened to reveal entertaining acts such as story-reading , dancing and music . and once christmas is over , it is soon time for new year 's eve .

his comments come ahead of a two-day visit to germany . russia is aiming for a free trade zone and a common industrial policy with the european union .
prime minister vladimir putin , writing in the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung on thursday , said his goal was to create " a harmonious economic community from lisbon to vladivostok . "
cooperation between russia and the eu could even result in a free trade agreement or similar forms of economic integration eventually leading to a " common continental market . "
" we should be frank about it : the global economic crisis has revealed both russia and the eu to be economically very vulnerable , " putin wrote .
russia , he argued , was still too dependent on its energy exports , while the eu was in danger of jeopardizing its position on the international markets , due to a decrease in its industrial productivity .
" what 's on the agenda : how can we trigger a new wave of industrialization to roll across europe , " putin wrote .
different takes on energy cooperation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ' both russia and the eu have been shown to be economically very vulnerable ' : putin he suggested strategic alliances in key industries , including shipbuilding , car manufacturing , space exploration and the pharmaceutical industry .
energy policy , putin wrote , was another field where closer cooperation was needed .
from nuclear technology to gas and oil exploitation , there was a need for closer ties with brussels .
the european union gets around 25 percent of its natural gas from russia .
in the past , however , brussels has left little doubt that it wants to diversify its energy supply to reduce dependency on russia .
interruptions to the supply have in recent years lead to energy shortages in several eu member states .
putin also called for easing and eventually lifting visa restrictions between the eu and russia .
this , he wrote , would bring about not the end but rather the beginning of true integration between his country and the 27-nation bloc .
putin 's comments preceded his visit to germany , which starts on thursday .
he is scheduled to meet with german chancellor angela merkel on friday .
merkel , meanwhile , has downplayed the chances of a possible free trade zone .
speaking to reporters in berlin on thursday , she pointed to russian high tariffs and moscow 's trade relations with neighboring countries as potential stumbling blocks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gas transit interruptions have led to tensions with moscow " of course we support the idea of a free trade zone between the eu and russia but i have to pour a bit of cold water on it , " she said .
" the steps that russia has taken recently do not point in that direction . "
she pointed out that russia , not yet part of the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , has established trade ties with kazakhstan and belarus , countries whose statuses as potential wto members are far less certain than russia 's .
eon , gazprom on the agenda merkel and putin are also expected to discuss german energy company eon possibly selling its shares in russia 's gazprom .
media reports on wednesday suggested eon plans to drop the 3.5 percent stake it holds in the russian energy giant .
eon had dismissed reports that it would sell its 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6 billion -rrb- in shares , while a government spokesman in berlin confirmed the issue was on the agenda of the merkel-putin talks .
the eu is russia 's largest trading partner , making up about one half of its foreign trade .
total trade in the first half of the year was $ 141.9 billion -lrb- 106.3 billion euros -rrb- , according to the russian federal customs agency .

schalke 04 joined bayern munich in the last 16 of the champions league after a confident 3-0 win over lyon which hinted at a long-awaited return to form .
meanwhile , werder bremen continue to plumb the depths of despair . a team which had been struggling with a new faces and new tactics suddenly finds its feet in november , begins climbing the rungs in the bundesliga and marches in to the knockout stage of the champions league .
sound familiar ?
the story of bayern munich 's rise last season began , in some ways , like the unfolding tale of schalke 04 's campaign this time around .
bayern may never have flirted with the drop zone , but they began the season far off the pace .
right around the time christmas markets began opening up across the land , however , they found their rhythm - and built up the head of steam which carried them to their very successful end .
it remains fanciful to believe that schalke ’ s recent rampant form will be the start of a rise from the bottom to the top , resulting in schalke snatching the title in may , but it certainly appears - like bayern before them - that november is the month in which this schalke team began to click .
europe becomes schalke 's playground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huntelaar -lrb- m . -rrb- scored twice in schalke 's win over lyon schalke , in contrast to their wretched league from , have played well in europe nearly from the outset .
after a blip in their first group game at lyon , they have since won three and drawn one , a run of results which has seen them qualify for the knock-out rounds with a game to spare .
they could even go through as group winners .
wednesday night 's performance at home to lyon was the strongest indicator yet that schalke have turned a corner .
the team 's movement and one-touch passing was of such quality that it was hard to believe they were the same group that had sunk so desperately low in the bundesliga .
this was a truly european performance , with jefferson farfan and jose manuel jurado showing ingenuity and pace enough to rip the french defense to shreds .

schalke 04 joined bayern munich in the last 16 of the champions league after a confident 3-0 win over lyon which hinted at a long-awaited return to form .
meanwhile , werder bremen continue to plumb the depths of despair . a team which had been struggling with a new faces and new tactics suddenly finds its feet in november , begins climbing the rungs in the bundesliga and marches in to the knockout stage of the champions league .
sound familiar ?
the story of bayern munich 's rise last season began , in some ways , like the unfolding tale of schalke 04 's campaign this time around .
bayern may never have flirted with the drop zone , but they began the season far off the pace .
right around the time christmas markets began opening up across the land , however , they found their rhythm - and built up the head of steam which carried them to their very successful end .
it remains fanciful to believe that schalke ’ s recent rampant form will be the start of a rise from the bottom to the top , resulting in schalke snatching the title in may , but it certainly appears - like bayern before them - that november is the month in which this schalke team began to click .
europe becomes schalke 's playground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huntelaar -lrb- m . -rrb- scored twice in schalke 's win over lyon schalke , in contrast to their wretched league from , have played well in europe nearly from the outset .
after a blip in their first group game at lyon , they have since won three and drawn one , a run of results which has seen them qualify for the knock-out rounds with a game to spare .
they could even go through as group winners .
wednesday night 's performance at home to lyon was the strongest indicator yet that schalke have turned a corner .
the team 's movement and one-touch passing was of such quality that it was hard to believe they were the same group that had sunk so desperately low in the bundesliga .
this was a truly european performance , with jefferson farfan and jose manuel jurado showing ingenuity and pace enough to rip the french defense to shreds .
raul , meanwhile , showed a growing belief in his new team , and klaas jan huntelaar 's rediscovered scoring touch can only bode well for the coming weeks .
schalke looked like they knew exactly what to do , and precisely what coach felix magath wanted from them .

but critics say the plan misses the point and burdens domestic companies instead . as online advertising continues to grow rapidly throughout europe , french senators this week approved a new tax law aimed at securing the government to a piece of the revenue pie .
although the measure is popularly known as the " google tax " , it does not directly impact the internet giant , which has based its advertising business offshore and out of reach of french tax collectors .
instead , the one-percent charge will be levied on all french-based companies purchasing online publicity services .
the measure is expected to become law in 2011 and generate between 10 and 20 million euros per year if it is passed by the national assembly , as predicted .
supporters of the tax say it will put online advertising on an equality footing with other media .
broadcast and print advertisements are already subject to taxation in france .
television advertising alone pumps roughly 70 million euros into government coffers annually .
but critics say the government 's plan fails to meet its original goal : to tax the french operations of internet giants such as google , microsoft , ebay and amazon , which are located strategically in european countries with low corporate tax rates , such as ireland and luxembourg .
french business leaders fear the measure will burden small advertisers and lead to an exodus of larger internet stakeholders from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original goal of the levy was to tax offshore internet giants ' profits according to iab europe – an umbrella organization representing national trade associations for digital and interactive marketing – france 's online advertising market is europe 's third largest after the united kingdom and germany .
in 2009 , the uk market was worth 4 billion euros , the german market worth 3 billion , and the french market worth 1.7 billion .
kimon zorbas , vice president of iab europe , says the proposed law is shortsighted in that it hits french companies while giving their foreign competitors a break .
" our position is that this is a market which is already less than half the size of the english market .
france has a lot of catching up to do , and such a tax on a developing market is doubly negative , " he told deutsche welle .
" any tax is bound to have an effect on the market .
naturally the question now is how big of an effect , and that 's something we ca n't yet know . "
pattern of intervention recently , a distinctly french approach to the economic and cultural challenges presented by the internet has emerged .
in october the country announced a subsidy system under which young people can buy partially subsidized cards to purchase and download music with .
the program is intended to encourage the legal downloading of music over internet piracy .
it has also begun to send piracy warnings via email to illegal file sharers .
and in november france extended its 1981 lang law – which lets publishers set book prices and forbids booksellers from giving more than a 5 percent discount – to apply to e-books .

" france has a history of very deliberate federal supervision of – and sometimes intervention in – the media , " she told deutsche welle .
" they also have a very strong history of federal subsidies for culture … they see inequalities developing , and are perhaps more likely to intervene because of their historical attitudes in this respect . "
zorbas added that specialized national taxes could create disunity among european nations trying to increase their combined market share , and that attempts to create boundaries in the internet " just ca n't work out . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.11.2010 specter of ' ghost estates ' haunt post-property boom ireland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's easy to find housing estates like spencer dock in ireland the building boom , when economic times were good in ireland , has led to a huge oversupply of homes across the country .
so-called " ghost estates " now blight the republic , with many homes left unoccupied or unfinished . ask a taxi driver in dublin to take you to a " ghost estate , " and a kind one will point out that you can walk there and do n't actually need a cab .
there are several examples of unfinished or largely unoccupied housing developments in the irish capital , one of which is called spencer dock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while there may be lots of housing , there are few real homes spencer dock 's developers say the project will be completed and residency rates will rise , but it is currently far emptier than they would like , and stationary cranes dot the landscape with unfinished buildings breaking the skyline . apart from the main road a street away , there is little activity - the sound of children playing outside is rarely heard , for example , according to those people who have taken up residence .
there is also a shiny new tram line , but very few people waiting to use it .
it is hard to find irish residents living in this development off the banks of the river liffey and just outside the center of dublin .
mikaela ekman moved here from sweden .
she acknowledged the strange atmosphere in the largely empty neighborhood .
" yeah , it 's very half finished ! " she said , laughing and pointing to the cranes around nearby buildings .
spencer dock 's developers have even had to launch legal action against customers who agreed to buy property on the site but have changed their mind in view of plummeting home values and low residency .
a problem not confined to dublin there are far too many buildings for people in ireland , according to brendan williams , a lecturer in urban development at university college dublin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williams says housing supply vastly outstrips demand " we estimate that the overproduction or oversupply in the housing area is approximately 17 percent ; in other areas , such as commercial and offices , it 's of the order of 20 percent , " he said .
" there is also an oversupply in other sectors as well , such as hotels . "
williams says construction continued at a rapid pace in the irish republic long after signs appeared that the economy was cooling , with disastrous effects for irish banks that invested heavily in the housing boom .
" in a general sense , there was an oversupply and an overbuilding that continued largely through the period 2004-2009 , which contributed , obviously , to the eventual failure of the property market . "
nearly 100,000 homes were built in 2006 alone .
williams said house prices have crashed by as much as 50 percent from their peak .
that has wiped billions of euros off the balance sheets of the banks .
what now for ghost estates ?
it 's not clear exactly how many homes are unoccupied across ireland .
some estimates put the figure as high as 300,000 .
what is clear is that for the few residents who live in the ghost estates , life can be miserable .
some have such low occupancy rates that shopkeepers have declined to open in the area ; on some one side of the road is finished , while the other is not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steven lewis is very aware of the problems of living on a ghost estate steven lewis is one of those who has chosen to live on what he himself describes as a ghost estate just outside dublin .
he has done so because rent is cheap , but admits there is a downside .
" i 've had my car broken into three times this year , " he said , acknowledging the problems with crime on estates where little pride is felt by residents for their unfinished surroundings .
steven sympathizes with those people who actually bought property where he lives .
" my heart goes out to working class families that have bought a home , and they open up their windows and they see a half-finished house across the road from them , " he said .
" they 're now developing sewerage problems and all sorts of other health issues .
my heart seriously goes out to these people because they ca n't move on now . "
a need to face up to reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are new tram connections , but few passengers to use them the solution to these problems is one that may be unpalatable to banks , developers and property owners alike .
williams says that people need to acknowledge the realities of vast oversupply and start selling unoccupied properties in ghost estates at vastly knocked-down prices .

so-called " ghost estates " now blight the republic , with many homes left unoccupied or unfinished . ask a taxi driver in dublin to take you to a " ghost estate , " and a kind one will point out that you can walk there and do n't actually need a cab .
there are several examples of unfinished or largely unoccupied housing developments in the irish capital , one of which is called spencer dock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while there may be lots of housing , there are few real homes spencer dock 's developers say the project will be completed and residency rates will rise , but it is currently far emptier than they would like , and stationary cranes dot the landscape with unfinished buildings breaking the skyline . apart from the main road a street away , there is little activity - the sound of children playing outside is rarely heard , for example , according to those people who have taken up residence .
there is also a shiny new tram line , but very few people waiting to use it .
it is hard to find irish residents living in this development off the banks of the river liffey and just outside the center of dublin .
mikaela ekman moved here from sweden .
she acknowledged the strange atmosphere in the largely empty neighborhood .
" yeah , it 's very half finished ! " she said , laughing and pointing to the cranes around nearby buildings .
spencer dock 's developers have even had to launch legal action against customers who agreed to buy property on the site but have changed their mind in view of plummeting home values and low residency .
a problem not confined to dublin there are far too many buildings for people in ireland , according to brendan williams , a lecturer in urban development at university college dublin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williams says housing supply vastly outstrips demand " we estimate that the overproduction or oversupply in the housing area is approximately 17 percent ; in other areas , such as commercial and offices , it 's of the order of 20 percent , " he said .
" there is also an oversupply in other sectors as well , such as hotels . "
williams says construction continued at a rapid pace in the irish republic long after signs appeared that the economy was cooling , with disastrous effects for irish banks that invested heavily in the housing boom .
" in a general sense , there was an oversupply and an overbuilding that continued largely through the period 2004-2009 , which contributed , obviously , to the eventual failure of the property market . "
nearly 100,000 homes were built in 2006 alone .
williams said house prices have crashed by as much as 50 percent from their peak .
that has wiped billions of euros off the balance sheets of the banks .
what now for ghost estates ?
it 's not clear exactly how many homes are unoccupied across ireland .
some estimates put the figure as high as 300,000 .
what is clear is that for the few residents who live in the ghost estates , life can be miserable .
some have such low occupancy rates that shopkeepers have declined to open in the area ; on some one side of the road is finished , while the other is not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steven lewis is very aware of the problems of living on a ghost estate steven lewis is one of those who has chosen to live on what he himself describes as a ghost estate just outside dublin .
he has done so because rent is cheap , but admits there is a downside .
" i 've had my car broken into three times this year , " he said , acknowledging the problems with crime on estates where little pride is felt by residents for their unfinished surroundings .
steven sympathizes with those people who actually bought property where he lives .
" my heart goes out to working class families that have bought a home , and they open up their windows and they see a half-finished house across the road from them , " he said .
" they 're now developing sewerage problems and all sorts of other health issues .
my heart seriously goes out to these people because they ca n't move on now . "
a need to face up to reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are new tram connections , but few passengers to use them the solution to these problems is one that may be unpalatable to banks , developers and property owners alike .
williams says that people need to acknowledge the realities of vast oversupply and start selling unoccupied properties in ghost estates at vastly knocked-down prices .
but there 's another looming problem that could make such steps immaterial : with tens of thousands of people expected to leave ireland in the coming years because of its economic problems , excess supply in the housing market may yet worsen further .

deutsche welle has compiled a list of this month 's highlights . nikolaus is coming he may look similar to santa claus , but he is not quite the same thing .
in germany , saint nicholas - known as nikolaus - also has a white beard and carries a sack full of presents on his back , but he visits children in the wee hours of december 6 .
this date is not incidental , as december 6 is when people called nikolaus celebrate their name day in germany , in honor of the saint 's birthday . the story behind the event goes back to the third and fourth century ad .
saint nicholas - originally known as nikolaos of myra - was a greek bishop .
he had a reputation for gift-giving , which is why he also became the model for santa claus .
he is also known as the patron saint of children . in germany , kids eagerly await nikolaus each year .
they traditionally put a boot outside the front door on the evening of december 5 , expecting saint nicholas to fill it with gifts and sweets while they sleep .
this crucial part is usually performed by the parents , of course , but they like to make their children believe that saint nicholas rewards those who have been good and polite throughout the year . on the other hand , the german equivalent of santa claus - called weihnachtsmann -lrb- christmas man -rrb- - comes on christmas eve , along with the christkind -lrb- christ child -rrb- who is also a traditional gift-bringer in germany and other parts of central europe .
the figure of the christkind goes back to the times of martin luther , who , in line with his protestant teachings , discouraged the worship of saints , including saint nicholas . bildunterschrift : both nikolaus and santa claus were based on the same early christian saint results of the latest education study how good is the german education system ?
when the first pisa -lrb- programme for international student assessment -rrb- study came out in 2001 - a worldwide evaluation of 15-year-old school students ' scholastic performance - germany did not score particularly well .
the country 's media used terms like " pisa shock " to reflect the general disappointment . the study has been carried out every three years since then , with the latest results , due to be released on december 7 , focusing on reading abilities .
however , there is some controversy about how accurately the study really reflects the quality of an education system .
some critics point out that a student 's performance is influenced by many factors , and so it can not be explained by the quality of the school system alone . nevertheless , since the study came into existence , many are looking toward finland for guidance , as this northern european nation regularly scores excellent marks in pisa .
some believe that the german school system may be at fault after all .
the german tradition of dividing students into different types of high schools based on their academic performance has already been disputed and debated for quite some time .
and the pisa study only helps to fan the flames of this debate . big names on the big screen a much talked-about new movie by florian henckel von donnersmarck , " the tourist , " debuts in german movie theaters on december 16 .
the director won the academy award for best foreign language film in 2007 for his east-germany-based drama " the lives of others . " the film , which features hollywood stars angelina jolie and johnny depp in the main roles , is a thriller set in venice about an american tourist -lrb- depp -rrb- who is used by an english woman -lrb- jolie -rrb- in an attempt to mislead those following her criminal ex-lover . bildunterschrift : angelina jolie und johnny depp star in " the tourist " napoleon exhibition talking about your country 's history is not always easy - the germans know this all too well .
in the case of france , this problem relates to its former ruler and military leader napoleon bonaparte .
many french people are not proud of his imperialistic conquests and demonstrations of power , so it is not easy to organize an exhibition on the topic in his homeland , according to the spokesperson for the art and exhibition hall of the federal republic of germany in bonn . from december 17 , the art and exhibition hall will host the exhibition " napoleon and europe .
dream and trauma , " which aims to explain who napoleon really was and how he rose to power .
items on display include original documents , paintings and everyday objects .
the exhibition 's curator is french scholar benedicte savoy , who teaches art history at the berlin institute of technology .
the exhibition will travel to france in march next year .
bildunterschrift : the exhibition features paintings depicting the life of napoleon , including battle scenes merry christmas and happy new year in germany , advent marks the countdown to christmas , which celebrates the birth of jesus christ .
during this time , an advent wreath decorates the tables in many german households .
this tradition can be traced back to johann hinrich wichern , a 19th-century german protestant pastor , who invented the wreath to make the advent time seem shorter for children , since they could light one candle in it each day . some theaters in germany offer a special advent program , where on each of the days between december 1 and december 24 -lrb- christmas eve -rrb- a little " door " is opened to reveal entertaining acts such as story-reading , dancing and music . and once christmas is over , it is soon time for new year 's eve .
as is customary on this special night , a large fireworks show will take place at the brandenburg gate in berlin to ring in 2011 when the clock strikes midnight . bildunterschrift : advent calendars were invented to contain children 's excitement ahead of christmas author : petra lambeck -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? # morewwwlinkstext # napoleon exhibition at bonn 's art and exhibition hall feedback do you celebrate a special tradition in december ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 25.11.2010 france plans to introduce new ' google tax ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris thinks google could contribute more to french coffers the french senate has approved a new tax on online advertising services offered by internet giants such as google .
but critics say the plan misses the point and burdens domestic companies instead . as online advertising continues to grow rapidly throughout europe , french senators this week approved a new tax law aimed at securing the government to a piece of the revenue pie .
although the measure is popularly known as the " google tax " , it does not directly impact the internet giant , which has based its advertising business offshore and out of reach of french tax collectors .
instead , the one-percent charge will be levied on all french-based companies purchasing online publicity services .
the measure is expected to become law in 2011 and generate between 10 and 20 million euros per year if it is passed by the national assembly , as predicted .
supporters of the tax say it will put online advertising on an equality footing with other media .
broadcast and print advertisements are already subject to taxation in france .
television advertising alone pumps roughly 70 million euros into government coffers annually .
but critics say the government 's plan fails to meet its original goal : to tax the french operations of internet giants such as google , microsoft , ebay and amazon , which are located strategically in european countries with low corporate tax rates , such as ireland and luxembourg .
french business leaders fear the measure will burden small advertisers and lead to an exodus of larger internet stakeholders from france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the original goal of the levy was to tax offshore internet giants ' profits according to iab europe – an umbrella organization representing national trade associations for digital and interactive marketing – france 's online advertising market is europe 's third largest after the united kingdom and germany .
in 2009 , the uk market was worth 4 billion euros , the german market worth 3 billion , and the french market worth 1.7 billion .
kimon zorbas , vice president of iab europe , says the proposed law is shortsighted in that it hits french companies while giving their foreign competitors a break .
" our position is that this is a market which is already less than half the size of the english market .
france has a lot of catching up to do , and such a tax on a developing market is doubly negative , " he told deutsche welle .
" any tax is bound to have an effect on the market .
naturally the question now is how big of an effect , and that 's something we ca n't yet know . "
pattern of intervention recently , a distinctly french approach to the economic and cultural challenges presented by the internet has emerged .
in october the country announced a subsidy system under which young people can buy partially subsidized cards to purchase and download music with .
the program is intended to encourage the legal downloading of music over internet piracy .
it has also begun to send piracy warnings via email to illegal file sharers .
and in november france extended its 1981 lang law – which lets publishers set book prices and forbids booksellers from giving more than a 5 percent discount – to apply to e-books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president sarkozy 's government has been grappling with internet issues karin von abrams , a london-based analyst for emarketer , tracks the french market and says that while governments are generally " very wary of hindering " the growth of online markets , it 's not surprising that france would seek to tax them .
" france has a history of very deliberate federal supervision of – and sometimes intervention in – the media , " she told deutsche welle .
" they also have a very strong history of federal subsidies for culture … they see inequalities developing , and are perhaps more likely to intervene because of their historical attitudes in this respect . "
zorbas added that specialized national taxes could create disunity among european nations trying to increase their combined market share , and that attempts to create boundaries in the internet " just ca n't work out . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 25.11.2010 majority of germans do not want their monarchy back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : queen elizabeth is popular in germany , though the germans do n't want a queen of their own all of germany celebrated when the news broke of the upcoming royal wedding in england .
while germans follow their royal neighbors with great interest , a new poll shows they 're quite content without a monarchy . despite massive interest in the royal families of other european countries , 67 percent of the germans surveyed do n't want their own royal family back .
the poll was commissioned as a new wave of royal wedding fever sweeps the country with the recent engagement of prince william and kate middleton making the front pages of almost all daily newspapers and glossy magazines . yet despite this keen interest in the affairs of other countries ' royal families , the majority of germans are content to observe the ups and downs of royal life beyond their own borders without wishing for a return to the days when germany itself boasted a royal court .
content with status quo on the streets of berlin , the general opinion of passersby certainly confirmed the findings of the stern survey .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : william and kate 's engagement caused a blizzard of press interest " we certainly do n't need a monarchy , " said one woman , " and all this hullaballoo they are making in england about it , i find that rather difficult to comprehend . "
" for germany , it 's definitely not something we need , " said one man , " i 'm happy that we 're a republic with a solid constitution .
it 's enough for me to read about this kind of thing in the paper . "
" i read in the paper just how much the british monarchy costs the taxpayer , " explained one man , " and for that reason alone it 's something we should n't indulge in ourselves . "
" we do still have a royal house of sorts , " explained one young woman , " and -lsb- defense minister -rsb- karl-theodor zu guttenberg has kind of become an ersatz king if you like .
he has the name , the heritage , the popularity and represents that there is a need for this kind of person in germany . "
nearly a century ago germany 's monarchy was abolished in 1918 at the end of world war i and the abdication of kaiser wilhelm ii .
after giving up the german throne , he fled to the netherlands and spent the rest of his life there in relative obscurity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaiser wilhelm ii , germany 's last emperor , held office from 1888-1918 while the kaiser 's descendants today are rarely mentioned in the german press , wilhelm 's crypt in huis doorn , netherlands , is an annual meeting place for a small but dedicated number of german monarchists who come together on the anniversary of his death on november 18 .
kaiser wilhelm ii 's involvement in world war i is arguably the reason why he is not glorified by germans today and why they seek their royal role models elsewhere .
the june wedding of victoria , crown princess of sweden to daniel westling was watched by a global audience of around 1 billion while the couple 's popularity in their home country soared with around 70 percent of swedes declaring their support for the monarchy .
since prince william and kate middleton 's engagement in kenya in october , germans have been keenly following the story and will no doubt be glued to the television when the couple ties the knot in 2011 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 25.11.2010 ahead of summit , groups urge eu to reexamine africa trade policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana 's poultry industry is near a halt due to uneven trade with the eu several german development groups have called for improvement in eu trade policy with africa ahead of a joint eu-africa summit . some non-governmental groups have warned the european union not to let negotiations fail on a free trade agreement between african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- countries , and the eu , when the parties meet for a summit in tripoli , libya , on nov .
29 and 30 .
until now , only a few limited deals - so-called economic partnership agreements - have been made between the eu and select acp nations .
while the eu and the acp group of nations have had a common free-trade agreement since 2002 , so far , that agreement has done little for africa , according to ngos like oxfam , misereor and the german church development group , evangelischer entwicklungsdienst .
and according to these groups , the blame lies entirely with europe .
skepticism , hope ahead of meeting now , the african nations are demanding that 80 percent of all tariffs on imported goods be abolished .
at the same time , they want the export of raw materials to be restricted .
for its part , the european union is pressing for free-trade for services . african countries would have little hope of being able to export services themselves , since the service industry is far less expansive there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxfam is one of the groups calling for change after years of unsuccessful negotiations , oxfam trade policy advisor david hachfeld said he is sceptical about the chances that next week ’ s summit will bring the two continents onto the same page .
and he is worried that individual countries may decide to take unilateral action .
" if most of the countries in a particular region want to refuse services , but one or two countries in that region want the services , then the european union is prepared to keep working with those one or two countries , " hachfield said .
" that would be devastating in my opinion , and i hope the african countries won ’ t let themselves be divided like that . "
but offah obale , a cameroonian consultant for the african union , is more optimistic .
he says the fact that 80 heads of state are expected to attend the tripoli summit make it a unique opportunity to resolve the trade dispute between the eu and africa at the highest political level .
warning on increased poverty " i think it will be hypocritical for african and european leaders to continue going to new york and talk about achieving millenium goals by 2015 and not talk about the major instrument , " obale said .
" so my major expectation in the area of trade is that the summit at the end of this month will come out with a consensus on the way forward with respect to economic partnership agreements . "
senegalese ndiaga mboub , who works with the world health organisation in geneva , switzerland , added that if nothing changes , trade policy between africa and the eu will only serve to increase poverty across africa .
more far-reaching change in african industry is needed to overcome what he described as a new kind of colonialism .
" the problem is that africa ca n't develop on its own , in that it exports raw materials and agricultural products to europe , " he said .
" not one single country is going to make any progress if it doesn ’ t develop its own industry .
it 's still the case that africa sends raw materials off to european factories where they 're processed further , for example in the oil industry . "
oxfam 's hachfeld said that he increasingly questions the eu 's africa strategy because other countries are already on the way to outpacing the eu in terms of striking trade deals .
" why should african countries be so reliant on the european union when they can see that the growth rates in trade with india , china , and brazil are three times as high as they are with the eu ? " he asks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some farmers in africa have suffered under increased eu exports poultry and dairy industries suffer african agriculture has suffered under the current trade imbalances .
for example , poultry breeding and processing in ghana has ground almost to a halt , because the eu has increased its exports to the country from almost 5,000 tons in 1998 to 90,000 tons in 2009 .
another example is dairy exports to africa , which rose by over 40 percent between 2005 and 2008 .
these jumps in eu exports might be good news for european farmers .
but german development groups have said they are coming at the expense of african farmers , and they want the situation to change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.11.2010 specter of ' ghost estates ' haunt post-property boom ireland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's easy to find housing estates like spencer dock in ireland the building boom , when economic times were good in ireland , has led to a huge oversupply of homes across the country .
so-called " ghost estates " now blight the republic , with many homes left unoccupied or unfinished . ask a taxi driver in dublin to take you to a " ghost estate , " and a kind one will point out that you can walk there and do n't actually need a cab .
there are several examples of unfinished or largely unoccupied housing developments in the irish capital , one of which is called spencer dock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while there may be lots of housing , there are few real homes spencer dock 's developers say the project will be completed and residency rates will rise , but it is currently far emptier than they would like , and stationary cranes dot the landscape with unfinished buildings breaking the skyline . apart from the main road a street away , there is little activity - the sound of children playing outside is rarely heard , for example , according to those people who have taken up residence .
there is also a shiny new tram line , but very few people waiting to use it .
it is hard to find irish residents living in this development off the banks of the river liffey and just outside the center of dublin .
mikaela ekman moved here from sweden .
she acknowledged the strange atmosphere in the largely empty neighborhood .
" yeah , it 's very half finished ! " she said , laughing and pointing to the cranes around nearby buildings .
spencer dock 's developers have even had to launch legal action against customers who agreed to buy property on the site but have changed their mind in view of plummeting home values and low residency .
a problem not confined to dublin there are far too many buildings for people in ireland , according to brendan williams , a lecturer in urban development at university college dublin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williams says housing supply vastly outstrips demand " we estimate that the overproduction or oversupply in the housing area is approximately 17 percent ; in other areas , such as commercial and offices , it 's of the order of 20 percent , " he said .
" there is also an oversupply in other sectors as well , such as hotels . "
williams says construction continued at a rapid pace in the irish republic long after signs appeared that the economy was cooling , with disastrous effects for irish banks that invested heavily in the housing boom .
" in a general sense , there was an oversupply and an overbuilding that continued largely through the period 2004-2009 , which contributed , obviously , to the eventual failure of the property market . "
nearly 100,000 homes were built in 2006 alone .
williams said house prices have crashed by as much as 50 percent from their peak .
that has wiped billions of euros off the balance sheets of the banks .
what now for ghost estates ?
it 's not clear exactly how many homes are unoccupied across ireland .
some estimates put the figure as high as 300,000 .
what is clear is that for the few residents who live in the ghost estates , life can be miserable .
some have such low occupancy rates that shopkeepers have declined to open in the area ; on some one side of the road is finished , while the other is not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steven lewis is very aware of the problems of living on a ghost estate steven lewis is one of those who has chosen to live on what he himself describes as a ghost estate just outside dublin .
he has done so because rent is cheap , but admits there is a downside .
" i 've had my car broken into three times this year , " he said , acknowledging the problems with crime on estates where little pride is felt by residents for their unfinished surroundings .
steven sympathizes with those people who actually bought property where he lives .
" my heart goes out to working class families that have bought a home , and they open up their windows and they see a half-finished house across the road from them , " he said .
" they 're now developing sewerage problems and all sorts of other health issues .
my heart seriously goes out to these people because they ca n't move on now . "
a need to face up to reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are new tram connections , but few passengers to use them the solution to these problems is one that may be unpalatable to banks , developers and property owners alike .
williams says that people need to acknowledge the realities of vast oversupply and start selling unoccupied properties in ghost estates at vastly knocked-down prices .
but there 's another looming problem that could make such steps immaterial : with tens of thousands of people expected to leave ireland in the coming years because of its economic problems , excess supply in the housing market may yet worsen further .

but the opposition thinks not everyone is benefitting from the boom . just in time for the christmas , it seems german consumers are rediscovering the joys of shopping .
speaking to the lower house of the german parliament on thursday , economics minister rainer bruederle said domestic demand was on the upswing and stronger than expected , as consumers were once again feeling comfortable enough to go out and spend .
" we 're consuming again , people are doing well and people are spending again , " said bruederle , calling the economic upswing like something " out of a fairy tale . "
germany 's gross domestic product is expected to grow by about 3.5 percent this year , nearing a two-decade high , and by 2.6 percent in 2011 .
bruederle said under the governing center-right coalition of the christian democrats and the liberal free democrats , germany has become the economic model for all of europe , adding that the country could expect to enjoy its current economic growth for the foreseeable future .
the market research firm gfk said consumer morale rose more than expected in november , for the sixth month in a row .
and german business sentiment rose to its strongest level since 1991 in november , according to the ifo economic think tank .
in october , unemployment fell to an 18-year low , dropping below three million for the first time since november 2008 .
bruederle is convinced that full employment could soon be a possibility , adding that in many regions in the south of the country this was already a reality .
opposition calls for wage increases bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruederle said germany had become the economic model for all of europe however , the opposition greens , social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and left party criticized bruederle 's comments , saying the economic boom was leaving the unemployed , retired and poor behind .
garrelt duin , of the spd , said the economic upswing was not stable or balanced .
he said both domestic investment and wages needed to increase , to support the increased domestic demand .
michael schlecht of the left party pointed out that while businesses were enjoying a growth in profits of up to 40 percent , wages had hardly followed suit .
he said that since 2000 , businesses had seen incomes increase by at least 50 percent , but the income of the average worker has actually dropped .
schlecht also said austerity programs in other european union countries , such as greece and ireland , would have a negative trickledown effect on german exports , on which germany has traditionally relied to support its growth .
he called for a reversal of the reforms to the “ hartz iv ” welfare subsidy program and for the introduction of a set minimum wage of 10 euros -lrb- $ 13.4 -rrb- per hour , to shore up the domestic growth sector .

saint nicholas - originally known as nikolaos of myra - was a greek bishop .
he had a reputation for gift-giving , which is why he also became the model for santa claus .
he is also known as the patron saint of children . in germany , kids eagerly await nikolaus each year .
they traditionally put a boot outside the front door on the evening of december 5 , expecting saint nicholas to fill it with gifts and sweets while they sleep .
this crucial part is usually performed by the parents , of course , but they like to make their children believe that saint nicholas rewards those who have been good and polite throughout the year . on the other hand , the german equivalent of santa claus - called weihnachtsmann -lrb- christmas man -rrb- - comes on christmas eve , along with the christkind -lrb- christ child -rrb- who is also a traditional gift-bringer in germany and other parts of central europe .

however , there is some controversy about how accurately the study really reflects the quality of an education system .
some critics point out that a student 's performance is influenced by many factors , and so it can not be explained by the quality of the school system alone . nevertheless , since the study came into existence , many are looking toward finland for guidance , as this northern european nation regularly scores excellent marks in pisa .
some believe that the german school system may be at fault after all .
the german tradition of dividing students into different types of high schools based on their academic performance has already been disputed and debated for quite some time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 25.11.2010 ahead of summit , groups urge eu to reexamine africa trade policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ghana 's poultry industry is near a halt due to uneven trade with the eu several german development groups have called for improvement in eu trade policy with africa ahead of a joint eu-africa summit . some non-governmental groups have warned the european union not to let negotiations fail on a free trade agreement between african , caribbean and pacific -lrb- acp -rrb- countries , and the eu , when the parties meet for a summit in tripoli , libya , on nov .
29 and 30 .
until now , only a few limited deals - so-called economic partnership agreements - have been made between the eu and select acp nations .
while the eu and the acp group of nations have had a common free-trade agreement since 2002 , so far , that agreement has done little for africa , according to ngos like oxfam , misereor and the german church development group , evangelischer entwicklungsdienst .
and according to these groups , the blame lies entirely with europe .
skepticism , hope ahead of meeting now , the african nations are demanding that 80 percent of all tariffs on imported goods be abolished .
at the same time , they want the export of raw materials to be restricted .
for its part , the european union is pressing for free-trade for services . african countries would have little hope of being able to export services themselves , since the service industry is far less expansive there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oxfam is one of the groups calling for change after years of unsuccessful negotiations , oxfam trade policy advisor david hachfeld said he is sceptical about the chances that next week ’ s summit will bring the two continents onto the same page .
and he is worried that individual countries may decide to take unilateral action .
" if most of the countries in a particular region want to refuse services , but one or two countries in that region want the services , then the european union is prepared to keep working with those one or two countries , " hachfield said .
" that would be devastating in my opinion , and i hope the african countries won ’ t let themselves be divided like that . "
but offah obale , a cameroonian consultant for the african union , is more optimistic .
he says the fact that 80 heads of state are expected to attend the tripoli summit make it a unique opportunity to resolve the trade dispute between the eu and africa at the highest political level .
warning on increased poverty " i think it will be hypocritical for african and european leaders to continue going to new york and talk about achieving millenium goals by 2015 and not talk about the major instrument , " obale said .
" so my major expectation in the area of trade is that the summit at the end of this month will come out with a consensus on the way forward with respect to economic partnership agreements . "
senegalese ndiaga mboub , who works with the world health organisation in geneva , switzerland , added that if nothing changes , trade policy between africa and the eu will only serve to increase poverty across africa .
more far-reaching change in african industry is needed to overcome what he described as a new kind of colonialism .
" the problem is that africa ca n't develop on its own , in that it exports raw materials and agricultural products to europe , " he said .
" not one single country is going to make any progress if it doesn ’ t develop its own industry .
it 's still the case that africa sends raw materials off to european factories where they 're processed further , for example in the oil industry . "
oxfam 's hachfeld said that he increasingly questions the eu 's africa strategy because other countries are already on the way to outpacing the eu in terms of striking trade deals .
" why should african countries be so reliant on the european union when they can see that the growth rates in trade with india , china , and brazil are three times as high as they are with the eu ? " he asks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some farmers in africa have suffered under increased eu exports poultry and dairy industries suffer african agriculture has suffered under the current trade imbalances .
for example , poultry breeding and processing in ghana has ground almost to a halt , because the eu has increased its exports to the country from almost 5,000 tons in 1998 to 90,000 tons in 2009 .
another example is dairy exports to africa , which rose by over 40 percent between 2005 and 2008 .
these jumps in eu exports might be good news for european farmers .
but german development groups have said they are coming at the expense of african farmers , and they want the situation to change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 25.11.2010 specter of ' ghost estates ' haunt post-property boom ireland großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's easy to find housing estates like spencer dock in ireland the building boom , when economic times were good in ireland , has led to a huge oversupply of homes across the country .
so-called " ghost estates " now blight the republic , with many homes left unoccupied or unfinished . ask a taxi driver in dublin to take you to a " ghost estate , " and a kind one will point out that you can walk there and do n't actually need a cab .
there are several examples of unfinished or largely unoccupied housing developments in the irish capital , one of which is called spencer dock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while there may be lots of housing , there are few real homes spencer dock 's developers say the project will be completed and residency rates will rise , but it is currently far emptier than they would like , and stationary cranes dot the landscape with unfinished buildings breaking the skyline . apart from the main road a street away , there is little activity - the sound of children playing outside is rarely heard , for example , according to those people who have taken up residence .
there is also a shiny new tram line , but very few people waiting to use it .
it is hard to find irish residents living in this development off the banks of the river liffey and just outside the center of dublin .
mikaela ekman moved here from sweden .
she acknowledged the strange atmosphere in the largely empty neighborhood .
" yeah , it 's very half finished ! " she said , laughing and pointing to the cranes around nearby buildings .
spencer dock 's developers have even had to launch legal action against customers who agreed to buy property on the site but have changed their mind in view of plummeting home values and low residency .
a problem not confined to dublin there are far too many buildings for people in ireland , according to brendan williams , a lecturer in urban development at university college dublin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : williams says housing supply vastly outstrips demand " we estimate that the overproduction or oversupply in the housing area is approximately 17 percent ; in other areas , such as commercial and offices , it 's of the order of 20 percent , " he said .
" there is also an oversupply in other sectors as well , such as hotels . "
williams says construction continued at a rapid pace in the irish republic long after signs appeared that the economy was cooling , with disastrous effects for irish banks that invested heavily in the housing boom .
" in a general sense , there was an oversupply and an overbuilding that continued largely through the period 2004-2009 , which contributed , obviously , to the eventual failure of the property market . "
nearly 100,000 homes were built in 2006 alone .
williams said house prices have crashed by as much as 50 percent from their peak .
that has wiped billions of euros off the balance sheets of the banks .
what now for ghost estates ?
it 's not clear exactly how many homes are unoccupied across ireland .
some estimates put the figure as high as 300,000 .
what is clear is that for the few residents who live in the ghost estates , life can be miserable .
some have such low occupancy rates that shopkeepers have declined to open in the area ; on some one side of the road is finished , while the other is not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steven lewis is very aware of the problems of living on a ghost estate steven lewis is one of those who has chosen to live on what he himself describes as a ghost estate just outside dublin .
he has done so because rent is cheap , but admits there is a downside .
" i 've had my car broken into three times this year , " he said , acknowledging the problems with crime on estates where little pride is felt by residents for their unfinished surroundings .
steven sympathizes with those people who actually bought property where he lives .
" my heart goes out to working class families that have bought a home , and they open up their windows and they see a half-finished house across the road from them , " he said .
" they 're now developing sewerage problems and all sorts of other health issues .
my heart seriously goes out to these people because they ca n't move on now . "
a need to face up to reality bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are new tram connections , but few passengers to use them the solution to these problems is one that may be unpalatable to banks , developers and property owners alike .
williams says that people need to acknowledge the realities of vast oversupply and start selling unoccupied properties in ghost estates at vastly knocked-down prices .
but there 's another looming problem that could make such steps immaterial : with tens of thousands of people expected to leave ireland in the coming years because of its economic problems , excess supply in the housing market may yet worsen further .

schalke 04 joined bayern munich in the last 16 of the champions league after a confident 3-0 win over lyon which hinted at a long-awaited return to form .
meanwhile , werder bremen continue to plumb the depths of despair . a team which had been struggling with a new faces and new tactics suddenly finds its feet in november , begins climbing the rungs in the bundesliga and marches in to the knockout stage of the champions league .
sound familiar ?
the story of bayern munich 's rise last season began , in some ways , like the unfolding tale of schalke 04 's campaign this time around .
bayern may never have flirted with the drop zone , but they began the season far off the pace .
right around the time christmas markets began opening up across the land , however , they found their rhythm - and built up the head of steam which carried them to their very successful end .
it remains fanciful to believe that schalke ’ s recent rampant form will be the start of a rise from the bottom to the top , resulting in schalke snatching the title in may , but it certainly appears - like bayern before them - that november is the month in which this schalke team began to click .
europe becomes schalke 's playground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : huntelaar -lrb- m . -rrb- scored twice in schalke 's win over lyon schalke , in contrast to their wretched league from , have played well in europe nearly from the outset .
after a blip in their first group game at lyon , they have since won three and drawn one , a run of results which has seen them qualify for the knock-out rounds with a game to spare .
they could even go through as group winners .
wednesday night 's performance at home to lyon was the strongest indicator yet that schalke have turned a corner .
the team 's movement and one-touch passing was of such quality that it was hard to believe they were the same group that had sunk so desperately low in the bundesliga .
this was a truly european performance , with jefferson farfan and jose manuel jurado showing ingenuity and pace enough to rip the french defense to shreds .
raul , meanwhile , showed a growing belief in his new team , and klaas jan huntelaar 's rediscovered scoring touch can only bode well for the coming weeks .
schalke looked like they knew exactly what to do , and precisely what coach felix magath wanted from them .
even the royal blues ' defense , which has been shaky at best for most of the season , gave a commanding performance ; the much-maligned christoph metzelder and benedikt hoewedes in particular gave towering displays to cut out the threat from lyon 's ordinarily potent offense led by yoann gourcuff and lisandro lopez .
magath will now have confidence that his jigsaw is finally settling in place and that schalke can continue their climb out of the lower reaches of the bundesliga while progressing with flair in europe .
bremen in crisis as confidence goes awol bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : down and out : bremen 's loss to spurs ended their hopes werder bremen coach thomas schaaf has it worse - much worse .
taken apart by schalke last weekend in the league and dumped out of europe by tottenham hotspur on wednesday night , the north german club look destined to spend the remaining months of the season engaged in a fight for belief , if not survival , while felix magath 's side rub shoulders with the likes of barcelona , real madrid and manchester united .
bremen look such a broken team that it 's hard to see where any kind of recovery will come from .
the team werder sent out at white hart lane on wednesday was a mix of shell-shocked veterans and overwhelmed reserves who were getting a game only because of the team ’ s injury woes .
tottenham were 2-0 up at half time , but the way the beleaguered bremen squad left the pitch at the interval , they may as well have stayed in the locker room and taken the forfeit .
-lrb- the game did end 3-0 , as it happened . -rrb-
in the end , it did n't matter what the deficit was - werder were eliminated from the champions league .
moreover , they would need to beat european champions inter milan in their final group game , and make up a seven goal difference on fc twente to even have a chance of a place in the europa league place .
in other words , it ’ s not happening .
bremen have a north german derby on sunday against fc st. pauli which would usually be billed as a david and goliath clash .
on recent form though , it 's hard to say which is the skinny boy with the sling .
bremen 's response to dropping out of european competition for another season at home to pauli this weekend may determine their season .
