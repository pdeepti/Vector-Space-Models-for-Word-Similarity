dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 04.03.2010 flat outing shows loew and germany have much to do großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coaching staff have plenty to think about after being outclassed by argentina , it 's clear the german national team have weaknesses in all phases of their game .
dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 04.03.2010 winter weather is bad news for berlin 's holocaust memorial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracks are both a dilemma and an embarrassment berlin 's holocaust memorial has cracks in a large number of concrete slabs that form the centerpiece of the site near the german capital 's reichstag parliament building . the director of the foundation that oversees the memorial , which commemorates those killed by the nazi regime under adolf hitler , says most of the 2,711 concrete slabs are damaged only five years after the monument opened .
according to director uwe neumaerker , more than two-thirds of the slabs are damaged , and experts so far have found no remedy .
germany 's mass circulation daily bild reported that as many as 2,200 slabs - more than three-quarters of all the stone elements - have developed cracks due to frost and other weather factors .
the paper cited experts who say the whole memorial , which originally cost nearly 28 million euros -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- , may have to be razed due to the instability of the slabs .
wrong kind of instability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the holocaust memorial at the unveiling of the monument in berlin five years ago , us architect peter eisenman said the work was " not too esthetic , and , of course , the experience of uncertainty and instability that we wanted is present in the memorial . "
at the time , he was clearly referring to the concept of his design and not to any sort of physical instability of the stones that form the pillars of the memorial field .
reports of some of the concrete slabs showing thin cracks first appeared in the media four years ago .
adam kerpel-fronius , from the memorial foundation , told deutsche welle that the problem was not new .
" this memorial site is not a small place .
we ourselves need about three days to look at all the slabs and find the cracks .
we do this on an annual basis to find out the state the memorial is in .
we last did so in october , and we 'll certainly do it again when the winter is over , " he said .
the cause is still unknown there have been attempts in the past to repair the damage with a synthetic resin injected into the cracks .
however , these attempts have not produced the desired results and a better technical solution , which would also better reflect the esthetic considerations , is not yet in sight .
mr. fronius said it was not even clear whether the increase in the number of cracks was really a direct result of the harsh winter weather .
he said a study has been commissioned to get to the heart of the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial has attracted more than eight million visitors " we are trying to find out , because scientifically it 's not established yet why the cracks appeared in the first place .
we do n't know , and the company -lrb- that built the memorial -rrb- does n't seem to know .
so , we have to establish the facts first , and that process is going on , " he said .
memorial still safe for visitors while the foundation admits that more and more cracks have appeared over time , it hastens to add that a structural analysis shows that the slabs are safe and are by no means in the process of falling apart , or of posing a danger to the visitors who walk around amongst them .
the foundation vehemently rejected the view voiced by the unnamed experts in the bild newspaper report , who suggested that the only solution would be to tear down the slabs and rebuild the memorial with more crack-resistant materials .
since the holocaust memorial opened , the field of slabs and the adjacent underground exhibition center have been a magnet for visitors .
over eight million people have walked through the monument , which is a stone 's throw from the reichstag and the brandenburg gate .

we ourselves need about three days to look at all the slabs and find the cracks .
we do this on an annual basis to find out the state the memorial is in .
we last did so in october , and we 'll certainly do it again when the winter is over , " he said .
the cause is still unknown there have been attempts in the past to repair the damage with a synthetic resin injected into the cracks .
however , these attempts have not produced the desired results and a better technical solution , which would also better reflect the esthetic considerations , is not yet in sight .
mr. fronius said it was not even clear whether the increase in the number of cracks was really a direct result of the harsh winter weather .
he said a study has been commissioned to get to the heart of the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial has attracted more than eight million visitors " we are trying to find out , because scientifically it 's not established yet why the cracks appeared in the first place .
we do n't know , and the company -lrb- that built the memorial -rrb- does n't seem to know .
so , we have to establish the facts first , and that process is going on , " he said .
memorial still safe for visitors while the foundation admits that more and more cracks have appeared over time , it hastens to add that a structural analysis shows that the slabs are safe and are by no means in the process of falling apart , or of posing a danger to the visitors who walk around amongst them .
the foundation vehemently rejected the view voiced by the unnamed experts in the bild newspaper report , who suggested that the only solution would be to tear down the slabs and rebuild the memorial with more crack-resistant materials .
since the holocaust memorial opened , the field of slabs and the adjacent underground exhibition center have been a magnet for visitors .
over eight million people have walked through the monument , which is a stone 's throw from the reichstag and the brandenburg gate .

a french nun had claimed that she was cured of parkinson 's disease after praying to john paul and asking him to intercede on her behalf .
but the italian daily la repubblica said in thursday 's online edition that the vatican 's medical commission determined that the woman 's diagnosis was not fully confirmed , and that some people who have certain variants of the disease have been known to recover spontaneously .
a newspaper in poland , rzeczpospolita , had earlier reported that the nun 's disease had returned .
but that claim was rejected by the priest charged with investigating john paul 's case for beatification , the step which precedes being declared a saint .
still on the road to sainthood john paul , who died in 2005 , was put on a fast track to sainthood just a month after his death by his successor , pope benedict xvi .
the catholic church normally requires a waiting period of five years after a potential candidate 's death before the process can begin , but this was waived in john paul 's case .

the pkk , or kurdistan workers ' party , is considered by the european union , united states and turkey to be a terrorist organization . over 300 police raided 25 sites all across belgium , the german news agency dpa reported , citing belgian news reports .
police also raided the offices in denderleeuw of roj tv , an international kurdish broadcaster that backs the pkk .
firat , a news agency with links to the pkk , reported that the people arrested included two former turkish parliament members involved in the party 's operations in europe , remzi kartal and zubeyir aydar .
since october 2009 aydar has been on a us list of drug traffickers suspected of using smuggling proceeds to fund the pkk .
turkey applauds arrests turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu told reporters that the raids showed belgian authorities ' " determination and sense of responsibility . "
" this action by belgium , following -lrb- similar operations in -rrb- italy and france , carries a very strong message to groups and organizations providing financial resources for terrorist activities , " davutoglu said .
the arrests have led the pkk to call for mass protests in brussels and " all parts of kurdistan " a reference to kurdish-populated areas in turkey , iraq , iran , and syria .
the pkk began fighting with turkey some 26 years ago in a quest for a separate kurdish state .

how are experts in asia reacting to this possible shift in us nuclear policy ? it has been nearly a year since us president barack obama unveiled his vision for a nuclear free world .
in a speech in the czech capital prague last april , he claimed america was committed ' to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons ' .
now his vision seems to be taking shape .
the new us nuclear policy review is expected to be announced in the next few weeks .
and as media reports suggest , the obama administration is likely to reduce its nuclear stockpile drastically and boost its conventional weapons capabilities .
the move will attract a lot of attention in asia , says commodore uday bhaskar , a security analyst in india .
" my sense is that the countries like india are looking at it with a lot of interest because these are objectives that india has been supporting and espousing for many decades and there has not been any serious international effort towards this end for many years . "
role of bigger nuclear powers despite india 's traditional stand on nuclear disarmament , it conducted nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998 and declared that it possessed nuclear capability .
its neighbor pakistan acquired nuclear weapons as well , stressing it needed them for defense against neighbors particularly india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a site of india ’ s nuclear test in 1998 neither country has signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty and experts doubt if they will ever give up their nuclear weapons as long as their relations remain strained .
moreover there is a school of thought that believes that the initiative to eliminate nuclear weapons should come from bigger nuclear powers .
" there are some 23,000 weapons all over the world .
out of this 22,000 are shared between us and russia , " says retired gen. talat masood , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the remaining one thousand are with other countries .
so i do n't think anyone should expect any change among other nuclear powers .
the lead has to come from us , russia , and then followed by other permanent un members and india , pakistan and israel . "
china 's dilemma china , on the other hand , has long maintained that it opposes nuclear proliferation and that its nuclear strategy is purely for self defense .
but its substantial increases in military budgets in recent years have sent signals that it wants to surpass the us as the world 's top military power .
oliver thränert , an expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , explains : " china thinks that the overwhelming superiority of the us in terms of its conventional weaponry means that a world without nuclear weapons would be a world in which the dominance of the us would be even clearer than now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea ’ s nuclear facilities at yongbyon north korea nuclear issue the idea of global nuclear disarmament has got considerable support in the northeast asia though , particularly in japan , the only country to have suffered nuclear bombardment .
the hatoyama government is seeking to denuclearize northeast asia as one of its top priorities , says key-young son an expert on international affairs in japan .
he says any signs from the us towards denuclearization will also give a fresh push to the six party talks on north korea 's nuclear program that have remain stalled for the last few years and which aim at paving the way for a nuclear free korean peninsula : " one of the reasons why north korea is hesitating to take steps forward is that the north korean government does n't believe in any intentions of the obama administration , " says key-young son .
" if the obama administration is moving to build trust in terms of nuclear issues , i think it will obviously help in the restart of nuclear talks and also it might change the attitude of north korea in a more positive direction in the near future . "
during his prague speech , obama admitted that the goal of a nuclear free world would not be reached quickly .
experts say lessons could be learned from the earlier disarmament efforts such as the chemical weapons convention which came into force in 1997 after many long years of negotiation .

the hatoyama government is seeking to denuclearize northeast asia as one of its top priorities , says key-young son an expert on international affairs in japan .
he says any signs from the us towards denuclearization will also give a fresh push to the six party talks on north korea 's nuclear program that have remain stalled for the last few years and which aim at paving the way for a nuclear free korean peninsula : " one of the reasons why north korea is hesitating to take steps forward is that the north korean government does n't believe in any intentions of the obama administration , " says key-young son .
" if the obama administration is moving to build trust in terms of nuclear issues , i think it will obviously help in the restart of nuclear talks and also it might change the attitude of north korea in a more positive direction in the near future . "
during his prague speech , obama admitted that the goal of a nuclear free world would not be reached quickly .
experts say lessons could be learned from the earlier disarmament efforts such as the chemical weapons convention which came into force in 1997 after many long years of negotiation .

how are experts in asia reacting to this possible shift in us nuclear policy ? it has been nearly a year since us president barack obama unveiled his vision for a nuclear free world .
in a speech in the czech capital prague last april , he claimed america was committed ' to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons ' .
now his vision seems to be taking shape .
the new us nuclear policy review is expected to be announced in the next few weeks .
and as media reports suggest , the obama administration is likely to reduce its nuclear stockpile drastically and boost its conventional weapons capabilities .
the move will attract a lot of attention in asia , says commodore uday bhaskar , a security analyst in india .
" my sense is that the countries like india are looking at it with a lot of interest because these are objectives that india has been supporting and espousing for many decades and there has not been any serious international effort towards this end for many years . "
role of bigger nuclear powers despite india 's traditional stand on nuclear disarmament , it conducted nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998 and declared that it possessed nuclear capability .
its neighbor pakistan acquired nuclear weapons as well , stressing it needed them for defense against neighbors particularly india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a site of india ’ s nuclear test in 1998 neither country has signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty and experts doubt if they will ever give up their nuclear weapons as long as their relations remain strained .
moreover there is a school of thought that believes that the initiative to eliminate nuclear weapons should come from bigger nuclear powers .
" there are some 23,000 weapons all over the world .
out of this 22,000 are shared between us and russia , " says retired gen. talat masood , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the remaining one thousand are with other countries .
so i do n't think anyone should expect any change among other nuclear powers .
the lead has to come from us , russia , and then followed by other permanent un members and india , pakistan and israel . "
china 's dilemma china , on the other hand , has long maintained that it opposes nuclear proliferation and that its nuclear strategy is purely for self defense .
but its substantial increases in military budgets in recent years have sent signals that it wants to surpass the us as the world 's top military power .
oliver thränert , an expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , explains : " china thinks that the overwhelming superiority of the us in terms of its conventional weaponry means that a world without nuclear weapons would be a world in which the dominance of the us would be even clearer than now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea ’ s nuclear facilities at yongbyon north korea nuclear issue the idea of global nuclear disarmament has got considerable support in the northeast asia though , particularly in japan , the only country to have suffered nuclear bombardment .
the hatoyama government is seeking to denuclearize northeast asia as one of its top priorities , says key-young son an expert on international affairs in japan .
he says any signs from the us towards denuclearization will also give a fresh push to the six party talks on north korea 's nuclear program that have remain stalled for the last few years and which aim at paving the way for a nuclear free korean peninsula : " one of the reasons why north korea is hesitating to take steps forward is that the north korean government does n't believe in any intentions of the obama administration , " says key-young son .
" if the obama administration is moving to build trust in terms of nuclear issues , i think it will obviously help in the restart of nuclear talks and also it might change the attitude of north korea in a more positive direction in the near future . "
during his prague speech , obama admitted that the goal of a nuclear free world would not be reached quickly .
experts say lessons could be learned from the earlier disarmament efforts such as the chemical weapons convention which came into force in 1997 after many long years of negotiation .

delegates from across china meet once a year to vote on proposed legislation .
and this year a few politicians in particular are in the spotlight . tian 'anmen square , located in the cbd of beijing , is now under tight security .
where tourists from all over the world usually take pictures , there are now police and soldiers .
they are there to keep peace and order for the 3,000 delegates who meet annually to discuss legislation .
skyrocketing real-estate prices , rampant corruption and disparities between the rich and the poor .
political scientist , gu xuewu from bonn university , believes this year , the national people 's congress will focus on domestic affairs .
experts say reorganizing the economy is at the top of the list .
one of beijing 's long term goals is to increase domestic demand and reduce exports .
gu xuewu does not expect anything world-shaking to come out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national people 's congress in beijings great hall of the people of the meeting .
" heads of the party will use the national people 's congress to test the reaction and the atmosphere among the people .
big decisions wo n't be made until after the meeting , when the politbureau meets again . "
the national people 's congress formally represents the voice of the chinese people and it is china 's highest legislative organ .
but the so-called " army of voters " only gives its approval to suggestions made by the party .
it is quite normal to have delegates vote 90 percent in favor on any random topic .
controversial discussions are very rare .
there was one in 1992 , when one third of the delegates voted against the construction of the three gorges dam project .
the npc has no say according to gu , when it comes to political decision making , the national people 's congress has no say : " when it comes to politics , to setting guidelines , political decisions are not made by the congress , but by the politbureau .
it is the party in china that retains the real power . "
what goes on behind the red velvet curtain in the great hall of the people , involves making private pacts and weaving webs of intrigues .
in two years there will be a generation change in party command .
cheng li of the brookings institute in washington says many are likely to be using the congress ' spotlight to spread their names throughout china . li thinks this goes especially for one man : party secretary of the city chongqing , bo xilai .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bo xilai is one of the leaders in spotlight " he is a self-made man , media-friendly and this is just one further event for him .
he already belongs to the 25-member politbureau .
he could very well become a member of the politbureau standing committee in two year 's time . "
the star of chinese politics bo xilai is the new star of the chinese politbureau .
born to a veteran of the revolution , he became known throughout china for cracking down on criminal gangs in chongqing .
the party newspaper named him man of the year .
bo xilai has held many party and government offices .
ex-party leader , jiang zemin , is one of his supporters .
but bo xilai is a controvercial figure .
some party members do n't agree with his take-no-gruff style .
but the people love him , it would seem .
bo 's rival in the fight for a seat in the politbureau standing committee is wang yang .
yang is the head of government in the rich guandong province .
he was a member of the communist youth league and is said to be president hu jintao 's protégé .
wang was bo xilai 's predecessor as party secretary of chongqing .
many believe bo xilai 's clampdown against organized crime was born out of spite for his predecessor .
but who will win in this power struggle has yet to be seen .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bo xilai is one of the leaders in spotlight " he is a self-made man , media-friendly and this is just one further event for him .
he already belongs to the 25-member politbureau .
he could very well become a member of the politbureau standing committee in two year 's time . "
the star of chinese politics bo xilai is the new star of the chinese politbureau .
born to a veteran of the revolution , he became known throughout china for cracking down on criminal gangs in chongqing .
the party newspaper named him man of the year .
bo xilai has held many party and government offices .
ex-party leader , jiang zemin , is one of his supporters .
but bo xilai is a controvercial figure .
some party members do n't agree with his take-no-gruff style .
but the people love him , it would seem .
bo 's rival in the fight for a seat in the politbureau standing committee is wang yang .
yang is the head of government in the rich guandong province .
he was a member of the communist youth league and is said to be president hu jintao 's protégé .
wang was bo xilai 's predecessor as party secretary of chongqing .
many believe bo xilai 's clampdown against organized crime was born out of spite for his predecessor .
but who will win in this power struggle has yet to be seen .

delegates from across china meet once a year to vote on proposed legislation .
and this year a few politicians in particular are in the spotlight . tian 'anmen square , located in the cbd of beijing , is now under tight security .
where tourists from all over the world usually take pictures , there are now police and soldiers .
they are there to keep peace and order for the 3,000 delegates who meet annually to discuss legislation .
skyrocketing real-estate prices , rampant corruption and disparities between the rich and the poor .
political scientist , gu xuewu from bonn university , believes this year , the national people 's congress will focus on domestic affairs .
experts say reorganizing the economy is at the top of the list .
one of beijing 's long term goals is to increase domestic demand and reduce exports .
gu xuewu does not expect anything world-shaking to come out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national people 's congress in beijings great hall of the people of the meeting .
" heads of the party will use the national people 's congress to test the reaction and the atmosphere among the people .
big decisions wo n't be made until after the meeting , when the politbureau meets again . "
the national people 's congress formally represents the voice of the chinese people and it is china 's highest legislative organ .
but the so-called " army of voters " only gives its approval to suggestions made by the party .
it is quite normal to have delegates vote 90 percent in favor on any random topic .
controversial discussions are very rare .
there was one in 1992 , when one third of the delegates voted against the construction of the three gorges dam project .
the npc has no say according to gu , when it comes to political decision making , the national people 's congress has no say : " when it comes to politics , to setting guidelines , political decisions are not made by the congress , but by the politbureau .
it is the party in china that retains the real power . "
what goes on behind the red velvet curtain in the great hall of the people , involves making private pacts and weaving webs of intrigues .
in two years there will be a generation change in party command .
cheng li of the brookings institute in washington says many are likely to be using the congress ' spotlight to spread their names throughout china . li thinks this goes especially for one man : party secretary of the city chongqing , bo xilai .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bo xilai is one of the leaders in spotlight " he is a self-made man , media-friendly and this is just one further event for him .
he already belongs to the 25-member politbureau .
he could very well become a member of the politbureau standing committee in two year 's time . "
the star of chinese politics bo xilai is the new star of the chinese politbureau .
born to a veteran of the revolution , he became known throughout china for cracking down on criminal gangs in chongqing .
the party newspaper named him man of the year .
bo xilai has held many party and government offices .
ex-party leader , jiang zemin , is one of his supporters .
but bo xilai is a controvercial figure .
some party members do n't agree with his take-no-gruff style .
but the people love him , it would seem .
bo 's rival in the fight for a seat in the politbureau standing committee is wang yang .
yang is the head of government in the rich guandong province .
he was a member of the communist youth league and is said to be president hu jintao 's protégé .
wang was bo xilai 's predecessor as party secretary of chongqing .
many believe bo xilai 's clampdown against organized crime was born out of spite for his predecessor .
but who will win in this power struggle has yet to be seen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 04.03.2010 flat outing shows loew and germany have much to do großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coaching staff have plenty to think about after being outclassed by argentina , it 's clear the german national team have weaknesses in all phases of their game .
dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

a first-half strike by gonzalo higuain was enough to secure a 1-0 victory over jogi loew 's hapless men . gonzalo higuain clipped a neat goal over the onrushing german goalkeeper rene adler to give diego maradona 's argentina an away win to a lackluster germany in munich 's allianz stadium .
germany was arguably maradona 's biggest scalp so far in his short career as argentina 's national coach , and the world cup legend made clear afterwards how seriously he had taken the challenge .
" we needed to show ourselves we could do what we did today , " maradona said in the post-match press conference .
" we wanted to show against a good team that we are alive and we understand the moment of the argentine national team , which has not won the world cup for 24 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona claimed his first high-profile scalp in munich reporters could not help but be reminded of the two famous world cup finals , both featuring maradona , germany and argentina fought out in 1986 and 1990 .

real madrid striker higuain , often overlooked by maradona and his predecessor alfio basile , beat adler to the ball by what the keeper later ruefully described as " that famous half-meter " and slotted home the finish .
throughout the rest of an edgy , tactical game , the german defence often resorted to rough-arm tactics to stop argentina 's star attackers lionel messi and angel di maria , though there was nothing they could do to stop a brilliant effort by the benfica player .
collecting veron 's pass about 25 metres from goal , di maria slipped his marker , thumped his shot against the crossbar and appeared to be smacked in the face by a defender immediately afterwards .
argentina dominate veron tried an even more spectacular effort early in the second half when adler failed to clear the ball properly and the estudiantes player lobbed the goalkeeper from about 40 meters only to see his effort just miss the target .

germany was arguably maradona 's biggest scalp so far in his short career as argentina 's national coach , and the world cup legend made clear afterwards how seriously he had taken the challenge .
" we needed to show ourselves we could do what we did today , " maradona said in the post-match press conference .
" we wanted to show against a good team that we are alive and we understand the moment of the argentine national team , which has not won the world cup for 24 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona claimed his first high-profile scalp in munich reporters could not help but be reminded of the two famous world cup finals , both featuring maradona , germany and argentina fought out in 1986 and 1990 .
adler 's howler the goal that decided wednesday 's friendly came after rene adler 's ill-advised decision to come out for a long ball knocked hopefully into the german half .
real madrid striker higuain , often overlooked by maradona and his predecessor alfio basile , beat adler to the ball by what the keeper later ruefully described as " that famous half-meter " and slotted home the finish .
throughout the rest of an edgy , tactical game , the german defence often resorted to rough-arm tactics to stop argentina 's star attackers lionel messi and angel di maria , though there was nothing they could do to stop a brilliant effort by the benfica player .
collecting veron 's pass about 25 metres from goal , di maria slipped his marker , thumped his shot against the crossbar and appeared to be smacked in the face by a defender immediately afterwards .
argentina dominate veron tried an even more spectacular effort early in the second half when adler failed to clear the ball properly and the estudiantes player lobbed the goalkeeper from about 40 meters only to see his effort just miss the target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friendly was one of the last warm-up games before the world cup germany came to life after cacau replaced the ineffective mesut oezil in the 67th minute , but while the brazilian-born forward tested argentinian keeper sergio romero with a powerful drive , he could do nothing to avert germany 's defeat , which marked the third game without a win for jogi loew 's men .
the frustrated german crowd watched most of the world cup warm-up match in silence , while argentinian supporters cheered as the south american powerhouses stroked the ball around in the dying minutes and greeted the final whistle with a resounding chorus of jeers .
" our mistake was not to take more risks up front , " concluded germany captain michael ballack after the game . according to fifa 's latest world rankings , germany is number five - four places above argentina at nine , one behind england .

a first-half strike by gonzalo higuain was enough to secure a 1-0 victory over jogi loew 's hapless men . gonzalo higuain clipped a neat goal over the onrushing german goalkeeper rene adler to give diego maradona 's argentina an away win to a lackluster germany in munich 's allianz stadium .
germany was arguably maradona 's biggest scalp so far in his short career as argentina 's national coach , and the world cup legend made clear afterwards how seriously he had taken the challenge .
" we needed to show ourselves we could do what we did today , " maradona said in the post-match press conference .
" we wanted to show against a good team that we are alive and we understand the moment of the argentine national team , which has not won the world cup for 24 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona claimed his first high-profile scalp in munich reporters could not help but be reminded of the two famous world cup finals , both featuring maradona , germany and argentina fought out in 1986 and 1990 .
adler 's howler the goal that decided wednesday 's friendly came after rene adler 's ill-advised decision to come out for a long ball knocked hopefully into the german half .
real madrid striker higuain , often overlooked by maradona and his predecessor alfio basile , beat adler to the ball by what the keeper later ruefully described as " that famous half-meter " and slotted home the finish .
throughout the rest of an edgy , tactical game , the german defence often resorted to rough-arm tactics to stop argentina 's star attackers lionel messi and angel di maria , though there was nothing they could do to stop a brilliant effort by the benfica player .
collecting veron 's pass about 25 metres from goal , di maria slipped his marker , thumped his shot against the crossbar and appeared to be smacked in the face by a defender immediately afterwards .
argentina dominate veron tried an even more spectacular effort early in the second half when adler failed to clear the ball properly and the estudiantes player lobbed the goalkeeper from about 40 meters only to see his effort just miss the target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friendly was one of the last warm-up games before the world cup germany came to life after cacau replaced the ineffective mesut oezil in the 67th minute , but while the brazilian-born forward tested argentinian keeper sergio romero with a powerful drive , he could do nothing to avert germany 's defeat , which marked the third game without a win for jogi loew 's men .
the frustrated german crowd watched most of the world cup warm-up match in silence , while argentinian supporters cheered as the south american powerhouses stroked the ball around in the dying minutes and greeted the final whistle with a resounding chorus of jeers .
" our mistake was not to take more risks up front , " concluded germany captain michael ballack after the game . according to fifa 's latest world rankings , germany is number five - four places above argentina at nine , one behind england .

in the country 's biggest terror trial in decades , a higher regional court in duesseldorf sentenced the two german converts , fritz gelowicz and daniel schneider , to 12 years each .
turkish national adem yilmaz was sentenced to 11 years , while german-turkish citizen attila selek will go to jail for five years .
" you were planning a monstrous bloodbath that would have killed an unfathomable number of people , " judge ottmar breidling said at the end of the trial , adding that their goal was to kill at least 150 american soldiers stationed in germany .
" you were blinded by a strange , hate-filled notion of jihad and you turned yourselves into angels of death in the name of islam , " breidling said .
the four defendants in the so-called ' sauerland ' cell had planned a " mass murder unrivaled in germany , " said federal prosecutor volker brinkmann in his closing argument .
" the plot still sends chills down one 's spine .
they appointed themselves masters over life and death . "
defense attorneys , however , called it " the largest failed terrorist attack . "
they had been asking for sentences of under ten years .
the defendants , self-confessed islamic militants , admitted to planning large-scale bomb attacks for the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- against discos and bars frequented by americans , airports and us military facilities in germany .
the attacks had been planned for october 2007 , during a parliament vote to extend german participation in the nato force in afghanistan .
police caught the first three suspects , daniel schneider , fritz gelowicz and adem yilmaz , in september 2007 as they were preparing 410 kilograms of explosives – 100 times the amount used in the 2005 london bombings , prosectors said .
the fourth defendant , atilla selek , was later captured in turkey .
rainer wendt , the head of the german police association , told the bild newspaper 's online editions that the association welcomed the verdict .
" the judgement shows that the german justice system is determined to proceed rigorously and without compromise , " wendt said .
but he also cautioned that " one should not have any illusions that terrorists are deterred by prison sentences . " cmk / afp / ap / dpa / apn editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 04.03.2010 flat outing shows loew and germany have much to do großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coaching staff have plenty to think about after being outclassed by argentina , it 's clear the german national team have weaknesses in all phases of their game .
dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .

as brussels painstakingly deliberates the merits of aspiring european union members in the balkans , beijing has begun an investment offensive in the region .
but is china ’ s money talking economics or politics ? last year , presidents hu jintao of china and boris tadic of serbia cemented their bilateral relations and traditional friendship with a strategic partnership .
besides reaffirming their mutual respect for one another 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , pledging broader , stronger and deeper ties , the two republics firmly stated their aim to promote economic cooperation and trade .
a document resulting from their partnership agreement said the two sides had expressed a readiness to “ ensure continuous and steady growth of bilateral trade and gradually improve the balance of bilateral trade through development in accordance with the principle of equality , mutual benefit , reciprocity and win-win result . ”
a few months down the line the export import bank of china -lrb- china eximbank -rrb- has granted belgrade a billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- loan to upgrade two power plants and build a much-needed bridge over the beautiful blue danube .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bridge would help unclog belgrade 's traffic the bridge project , which is due to get underway in the spring , is critical both as a means of easing the traffic situation in belgrade , and as a test of how well china can work with its south-eastern european partner .
an official from the cabinet of serbia 's national investment plan -lrb- nip -rrb- , who preferred not to be named , told deutsche welle that continued chinese presence in the region hinges on the success of the bridge scheme . " there are a lot of projects we would like the chinese to do , " he said .
" but they want to see how it turns out first . "
what 's good for one … and serbia is not the only country in the balkans which embraces the idea of a free-flowing yuan .
dusan reljic from the eu external relations division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that chinese presence is gathering momentum right across the region .
" the chinese are in slovenia , in macedonia , they 're exporting buses to skopje , they 're talking to croatia about transport facilities , harbors , airports , railway connections , " he said " and they 've been talking to the greeks about leasing possibilities in athens harbor . "
analysts have described china 's arrival in the balkans as an effort to get into europe through the back door .
but kerry brown of the asia program at london 's chatham house , disputes the need for sneaking in through the rear when the " front door is wide open . "
citing telecommunications and automotive high-tech retail industries as examples , he told deutsche welle that chinese investors are already in europe .
win-win result ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pireus harbor in athens dusan reljic agrees , but says taking the direct route to greater eu presence would be more costly for china than investing in territories poised to join within the next 10 to 15 years .
" it 's cheaper to buy assets there -lsb- southern-eastern europe -rsb- than within the present european union , " the expert said .
a cheap ride for china , but what 's in it for the conduit countries like serbia ?
" a good deal , " says reljic .
with very little direct foreign investment coming into the region , tight government budgets and unemployment rates on the rise again , he says balkan states need and welcome china 's money , which comes with grace periods , generously low interest rates and very few strings attached .
" the chinese do not attach economic or political conditions to their loans , " reljic said .
" in a way , cheap chinese money is an alternative to commercially expensive western money or politically expensive money from the international monetary fund or the world bank . "
the politics of economics but money is not the only factor at play .
reljic says beijing 's activities in the balkans are as much about political positioning as they are about financial returns .
" this increased presence is also a signal to the us and the west that china is no longer a peripheral world power , but it is the world power and it is engaging in all political developments throughout the world with its own agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kosovo is serbia " graffiti is testimony to kosovo 's disputed independence an example of that agenda is beijing 's vehement opposition to kosovo 's independence .
china recently spoke out against kosovo 's split from serbia at the international court of justice in the hague .
yet many analysts would say such public displays of support have less to do with china 's concern over stability in the balkans region than with a concern that its own minority groups might follow kosovo 's lead towards independence .
and that , says kerry brown is " absolutely not what they want . "
weighing it up so what do they want ?
" china wants to remake the world and is disappointed that the world wo n't comply . "
brown said .
" it is guided by self-interest and is happy to abuse friendships . "
he says china , which has itself stated its national aim of becoming a strong and wealthy country , is often hard for foreign partners to understand , which is why smaller countries like those in the balkans should be aware of what they want from a partnership with beijing .
" if countries say yes to everything , they have the complication of becoming a tributary state of china . "
but the nip official told deutsche welle such problems would not arise between belgrade and beijing .
" according to domestic law , we are obliged to hire third-party supervision , " he said .
" the chinese will not be given free reign to do whatever they want , no matter who they are dealing with . "

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

the attacks were planned to punish germany for its involvement in afghanistan . a german court has sentenced four self-confessed islamic militants to up to 12 years in jail for a failed plot to attack us targets in germany .
in the country 's biggest terror trial in decades , a higher regional court in duesseldorf sentenced the two german converts , fritz gelowicz and daniel schneider , to 12 years each .
turkish national adem yilmaz was sentenced to 11 years , while german-turkish citizen attila selek will go to jail for five years .
" you were planning a monstrous bloodbath that would have killed an unfathomable number of people , " judge ottmar breidling said at the end of the trial , adding that their goal was to kill at least 150 american soldiers stationed in germany .
" you were blinded by a strange , hate-filled notion of jihad and you turned yourselves into angels of death in the name of islam , " breidling said .
the four defendants in the so-called ' sauerland ' cell had planned a " mass murder unrivaled in germany , " said federal prosecutor volker brinkmann in his closing argument .
" the plot still sends chills down one 's spine .
they appointed themselves masters over life and death . "
defense attorneys , however , called it " the largest failed terrorist attack . "
they had been asking for sentences of under ten years .
the defendants , self-confessed islamic militants , admitted to planning large-scale bomb attacks for the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- against discos and bars frequented by americans , airports and us military facilities in germany .
the attacks had been planned for october 2007 , during a parliament vote to extend german participation in the nato force in afghanistan .
police caught the first three suspects , daniel schneider , fritz gelowicz and adem yilmaz , in september 2007 as they were preparing 410 kilograms of explosives – 100 times the amount used in the 2005 london bombings , prosectors said .
the fourth defendant , atilla selek , was later captured in turkey .
rainer wendt , the head of the german police association , told the bild newspaper 's online editions that the association welcomed the verdict .
" the judgement shows that the german justice system is determined to proceed rigorously and without compromise , " wendt said .
but he also cautioned that " one should not have any illusions that terrorists are deterred by prison sentences . " cmk / afp / ap / dpa / apn editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 04.03.2010 flat outing shows loew and germany have much to do großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coaching staff have plenty to think about after being outclassed by argentina , it 's clear the german national team have weaknesses in all phases of their game .
dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

a french nun had claimed that she was cured of parkinson 's disease after praying to john paul and asking him to intercede on her behalf .
but the italian daily la repubblica said in thursday 's online edition that the vatican 's medical commission determined that the woman 's diagnosis was not fully confirmed , and that some people who have certain variants of the disease have been known to recover spontaneously .
a newspaper in poland , rzeczpospolita , had earlier reported that the nun 's disease had returned .
but that claim was rejected by the priest charged with investigating john paul 's case for beatification , the step which precedes being declared a saint .
still on the road to sainthood john paul , who died in 2005 , was put on a fast track to sainthood just a month after his death by his successor , pope benedict xvi .
the catholic church normally requires a waiting period of five years after a potential candidate 's death before the process can begin , but this was waived in john paul 's case .
but the case is far from derailed - vatican investigators can now put forward one of the 271 other reported miracles attributed to john paul. svs / kna / dpad / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 04.03.2010 winter weather is bad news for berlin 's holocaust memorial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracks are both a dilemma and an embarrassment berlin 's holocaust memorial has cracks in a large number of concrete slabs that form the centerpiece of the site near the german capital 's reichstag parliament building . the director of the foundation that oversees the memorial , which commemorates those killed by the nazi regime under adolf hitler , says most of the 2,711 concrete slabs are damaged only five years after the monument opened .
according to director uwe neumaerker , more than two-thirds of the slabs are damaged , and experts so far have found no remedy .
germany 's mass circulation daily bild reported that as many as 2,200 slabs - more than three-quarters of all the stone elements - have developed cracks due to frost and other weather factors .
the paper cited experts who say the whole memorial , which originally cost nearly 28 million euros -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- , may have to be razed due to the instability of the slabs .
wrong kind of instability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the holocaust memorial at the unveiling of the monument in berlin five years ago , us architect peter eisenman said the work was " not too esthetic , and , of course , the experience of uncertainty and instability that we wanted is present in the memorial . "
at the time , he was clearly referring to the concept of his design and not to any sort of physical instability of the stones that form the pillars of the memorial field .
reports of some of the concrete slabs showing thin cracks first appeared in the media four years ago .
adam kerpel-fronius , from the memorial foundation , told deutsche welle that the problem was not new .
" this memorial site is not a small place .
we ourselves need about three days to look at all the slabs and find the cracks .
we do this on an annual basis to find out the state the memorial is in .
we last did so in october , and we 'll certainly do it again when the winter is over , " he said .
the cause is still unknown there have been attempts in the past to repair the damage with a synthetic resin injected into the cracks .
however , these attempts have not produced the desired results and a better technical solution , which would also better reflect the esthetic considerations , is not yet in sight .
mr. fronius said it was not even clear whether the increase in the number of cracks was really a direct result of the harsh winter weather .
he said a study has been commissioned to get to the heart of the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial has attracted more than eight million visitors " we are trying to find out , because scientifically it 's not established yet why the cracks appeared in the first place .
we do n't know , and the company -lrb- that built the memorial -rrb- does n't seem to know .
so , we have to establish the facts first , and that process is going on , " he said .
memorial still safe for visitors while the foundation admits that more and more cracks have appeared over time , it hastens to add that a structural analysis shows that the slabs are safe and are by no means in the process of falling apart , or of posing a danger to the visitors who walk around amongst them .
the foundation vehemently rejected the view voiced by the unnamed experts in the bild newspaper report , who suggested that the only solution would be to tear down the slabs and rebuild the memorial with more crack-resistant materials .
since the holocaust memorial opened , the field of slabs and the adjacent underground exhibition center have been a magnet for visitors .
over eight million people have walked through the monument , which is a stone 's throw from the reichstag and the brandenburg gate .

as brussels painstakingly deliberates the merits of aspiring european union members in the balkans , beijing has begun an investment offensive in the region .
but is china ’ s money talking economics or politics ? last year , presidents hu jintao of china and boris tadic of serbia cemented their bilateral relations and traditional friendship with a strategic partnership .

a cheap ride for china , but what 's in it for the conduit countries like serbia ?

with very little direct foreign investment coming into the region , tight government budgets and unemployment rates on the rise again , he says balkan states need and welcome china 's money , which comes with grace periods , generously low interest rates and very few strings attached .
" the chinese do not attach economic or political conditions to their loans , " reljic said .
" in a way , cheap chinese money is an alternative to commercially expensive western money or politically expensive money from the international monetary fund or the world bank . "
the politics of economics but money is not the only factor at play .
reljic says beijing 's activities in the balkans are as much about political positioning as they are about financial returns .
" this increased presence is also a signal to the us and the west that china is no longer a peripheral world power , but it is the world power and it is engaging in all political developments throughout the world with its own agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kosovo is serbia " graffiti is testimony to kosovo 's disputed independence an example of that agenda is beijing 's vehement opposition to kosovo 's independence .
china recently spoke out against kosovo 's split from serbia at the international court of justice in the hague .
yet many analysts would say such public displays of support have less to do with china 's concern over stability in the balkans region than with a concern that its own minority groups might follow kosovo 's lead towards independence .
and that , says kerry brown is " absolutely not what they want . "
weighing it up so what do they want ?
" china wants to remake the world and is disappointed that the world wo n't comply . "
brown said .
" it is guided by self-interest and is happy to abuse friendships . "
he says china , which has itself stated its national aim of becoming a strong and wealthy country , is often hard for foreign partners to understand , which is why smaller countries like those in the balkans should be aware of what they want from a partnership with beijing .
" if countries say yes to everything , they have the complication of becoming a tributary state of china . "
but the nip official told deutsche welle such problems would not arise between belgrade and beijing .
" according to domestic law , we are obliged to hire third-party supervision , " he said .
" the chinese will not be given free reign to do whatever they want , no matter who they are dealing with . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 04.03.2010 eu should drop failed sanctions policy against burma , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu sanctions have failed to win the release of burmese opposition leader aung san suu kyi while the eu announced a humanitarian aid package for burma this week , it left in place its 14-year old sanctions regime against the country .
experts say misguided sanctions are the wrong approach and counterproductive . on tuesday , the european union pledged to provide 17.3 million euros -lrb- $ 23.4 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid this year to burma .
most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .
while the eu aid package may provide much needed short-term help for burma , also know as myanmar , which ranks 138th out of 182 nations in the united nation 's human development index , it does n't address the most critical issue in europe 's dealings with the country , say experts .
since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "
bildunterschrift : the military rules with an iron fist over burma while the eu and the us have slapped sanctions against burma , most other countries have not , making it easy for the regime to circumvent the sanctions by dealing with other nations . " myanmar is ravaged by chinese businesses that extract natural resources , " says swanström .
" we have no possibility to influence that , so in a sense we lose every possibility to have an impact . "
counterproductive measures what 's more , says michael von hauff , an economist and burma expert at the university of kaiserslautern , the sanctions are not just ineffective , they are actually counterproductive and hurt not the ruling clique , but the burmese people .
" the living conditions of the people have deteriorated and for example many young women in the textile sector lost their jobs , " he told deutsche welle . recent events tend to underscore the experts ' perception that the junta 's demeanor and stance has not been altered by the sanctions regime .
last month , an american citizen and human rights activist was sentenced to five years in prison for forging an identity card .
shortly thereafter , four other human rights activists were sentenced to prison terms on the day of the arrival of the un 's human rights envoy .
during his five day-trip , un envoy tomas ojea quintana was n't allowed to visit aung san suu kyi .
instead of sanctions , the eu should try to engage in a dialogue with the regime .
this dialogue policy should n't focus primarily on the junta leaders , but rather on mid-level government officials , says von hauff .
he has been travelling to burma regularly since 2001 to hold seminars and made an important observation : " it was really interesting that most of the people from the ministries were very open .
we could discuss all the problems and also the human rights situation .
so we should have a differentiated picture of the country . "
push from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : childen suffer especially from the dismal economic situation in burma but in order to engage the government effectively , the eu must first drop its current failed sanctions policy , argue von hauff and swanström .
only than can it regain any possible leverage on the junta , which it lost through the sanctions .
whether and when that could happen neither of the experts venture to say .
the push to change the eu 's policy toward burma could come once again from the us .
washington has recently sent some signals that it is rethinking its sanctions regime . should washington decide to change its policy , the eu would probably do so as well , says von hauff .
" i have the feeling that we have the sanctions because the united states has sanctions and so the eu has to have sanctions as well . "

experts say misguided sanctions are the wrong approach and counterproductive . on tuesday , the european union pledged to provide 17.3 million euros -lrb- $ 23.4 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid this year to burma .
most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .

since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .

in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "
bildunterschrift : the military rules with an iron fist over burma while the eu and the us have slapped sanctions against burma , most other countries have not , making it easy for the regime to circumvent the sanctions by dealing with other nations . " myanmar is ravaged by chinese businesses that extract natural resources , " says swanström .
" we have no possibility to influence that , so in a sense we lose every possibility to have an impact . "
counterproductive measures what 's more , says michael von hauff , an economist and burma expert at the university of kaiserslautern , the sanctions are not just ineffective , they are actually counterproductive and hurt not the ruling clique , but the burmese people .
" the living conditions of the people have deteriorated and for example many young women in the textile sector lost their jobs , " he told deutsche welle . recent events tend to underscore the experts ' perception that the junta 's demeanor and stance has not been altered by the sanctions regime .
last month , an american citizen and human rights activist was sentenced to five years in prison for forging an identity card .
shortly thereafter , four other human rights activists were sentenced to prison terms on the day of the arrival of the un 's human rights envoy .
during his five day-trip , un envoy tomas ojea quintana was n't allowed to visit aung san suu kyi .
instead of sanctions , the eu should try to engage in a dialogue with the regime .
this dialogue policy should n't focus primarily on the junta leaders , but rather on mid-level government officials , says von hauff .
he has been travelling to burma regularly since 2001 to hold seminars and made an important observation : " it was really interesting that most of the people from the ministries were very open .
we could discuss all the problems and also the human rights situation .
so we should have a differentiated picture of the country . "
push from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : childen suffer especially from the dismal economic situation in burma but in order to engage the government effectively , the eu must first drop its current failed sanctions policy , argue von hauff and swanström .
only than can it regain any possible leverage on the junta , which it lost through the sanctions .
whether and when that could happen neither of the experts venture to say .
the push to change the eu 's policy toward burma could come once again from the us .
washington has recently sent some signals that it is rethinking its sanctions regime . should washington decide to change its policy , the eu would probably do so as well , says von hauff .
" i have the feeling that we have the sanctions because the united states has sanctions and so the eu has to have sanctions as well . "

the pkk , or kurdistan workers ' party , is considered by the european union , united states and turkey to be a terrorist organization . over 300 police raided 25 sites all across belgium , the german news agency dpa reported , citing belgian news reports .
police also raided the offices in denderleeuw of roj tv , an international kurdish broadcaster that backs the pkk .
firat , a news agency with links to the pkk , reported that the people arrested included two former turkish parliament members involved in the party 's operations in europe , remzi kartal and zubeyir aydar .
since october 2009 aydar has been on a us list of drug traffickers suspected of using smuggling proceeds to fund the pkk .
turkey applauds arrests turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu told reporters that the raids showed belgian authorities ' " determination and sense of responsibility . "
" this action by belgium , following -lrb- similar operations in -rrb- italy and france , carries a very strong message to groups and organizations providing financial resources for terrorist activities , " davutoglu said .
the arrests have led the pkk to call for mass protests in brussels and " all parts of kurdistan " a reference to kurdish-populated areas in turkey , iraq , iran , and syria .
the pkk began fighting with turkey some 26 years ago in a quest for a separate kurdish state .

how are experts in asia reacting to this possible shift in us nuclear policy ? it has been nearly a year since us president barack obama unveiled his vision for a nuclear free world .
in a speech in the czech capital prague last april , he claimed america was committed ' to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons ' .
now his vision seems to be taking shape .
the new us nuclear policy review is expected to be announced in the next few weeks .
and as media reports suggest , the obama administration is likely to reduce its nuclear stockpile drastically and boost its conventional weapons capabilities .
the move will attract a lot of attention in asia , says commodore uday bhaskar , a security analyst in india .
" my sense is that the countries like india are looking at it with a lot of interest because these are objectives that india has been supporting and espousing for many decades and there has not been any serious international effort towards this end for many years . "
role of bigger nuclear powers despite india 's traditional stand on nuclear disarmament , it conducted nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998 and declared that it possessed nuclear capability .
its neighbor pakistan acquired nuclear weapons as well , stressing it needed them for defense against neighbors particularly india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a site of india ’ s nuclear test in 1998 neither country has signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty and experts doubt if they will ever give up their nuclear weapons as long as their relations remain strained .
moreover there is a school of thought that believes that the initiative to eliminate nuclear weapons should come from bigger nuclear powers .
" there are some 23,000 weapons all over the world .
out of this 22,000 are shared between us and russia , " says retired gen. talat masood , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the remaining one thousand are with other countries .
so i do n't think anyone should expect any change among other nuclear powers .
the lead has to come from us , russia , and then followed by other permanent un members and india , pakistan and israel . "
china 's dilemma china , on the other hand , has long maintained that it opposes nuclear proliferation and that its nuclear strategy is purely for self defense .
but its substantial increases in military budgets in recent years have sent signals that it wants to surpass the us as the world 's top military power .
oliver thränert , an expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , explains : " china thinks that the overwhelming superiority of the us in terms of its conventional weaponry means that a world without nuclear weapons would be a world in which the dominance of the us would be even clearer than now .

the hatoyama government is seeking to denuclearize northeast asia as one of its top priorities , says key-young son an expert on international affairs in japan .
he says any signs from the us towards denuclearization will also give a fresh push to the six party talks on north korea 's nuclear program that have remain stalled for the last few years and which aim at paving the way for a nuclear free korean peninsula : " one of the reasons why north korea is hesitating to take steps forward is that the north korean government does n't believe in any intentions of the obama administration , " says key-young son .
" if the obama administration is moving to build trust in terms of nuclear issues , i think it will obviously help in the restart of nuclear talks and also it might change the attitude of north korea in a more positive direction in the near future . "
during his prague speech , obama admitted that the goal of a nuclear free world would not be reached quickly .
experts say lessons could be learned from the earlier disarmament efforts such as the chemical weapons convention which came into force in 1997 after many long years of negotiation .

how are experts in asia reacting to this possible shift in us nuclear policy ? it has been nearly a year since us president barack obama unveiled his vision for a nuclear free world .
in a speech in the czech capital prague last april , he claimed america was committed ' to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons ' .
now his vision seems to be taking shape .
the new us nuclear policy review is expected to be announced in the next few weeks .
and as media reports suggest , the obama administration is likely to reduce its nuclear stockpile drastically and boost its conventional weapons capabilities .
the move will attract a lot of attention in asia , says commodore uday bhaskar , a security analyst in india .
" my sense is that the countries like india are looking at it with a lot of interest because these are objectives that india has been supporting and espousing for many decades and there has not been any serious international effort towards this end for many years . "
role of bigger nuclear powers despite india 's traditional stand on nuclear disarmament , it conducted nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998 and declared that it possessed nuclear capability .
its neighbor pakistan acquired nuclear weapons as well , stressing it needed them for defense against neighbors particularly india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a site of india ’ s nuclear test in 1998 neither country has signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty and experts doubt if they will ever give up their nuclear weapons as long as their relations remain strained .
moreover there is a school of thought that believes that the initiative to eliminate nuclear weapons should come from bigger nuclear powers .
" there are some 23,000 weapons all over the world .
out of this 22,000 are shared between us and russia , " says retired gen. talat masood , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the remaining one thousand are with other countries .
so i do n't think anyone should expect any change among other nuclear powers .
the lead has to come from us , russia , and then followed by other permanent un members and india , pakistan and israel . "
china 's dilemma china , on the other hand , has long maintained that it opposes nuclear proliferation and that its nuclear strategy is purely for self defense .
but its substantial increases in military budgets in recent years have sent signals that it wants to surpass the us as the world 's top military power .
oliver thränert , an expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , explains : " china thinks that the overwhelming superiority of the us in terms of its conventional weaponry means that a world without nuclear weapons would be a world in which the dominance of the us would be even clearer than now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea ’ s nuclear facilities at yongbyon north korea nuclear issue the idea of global nuclear disarmament has got considerable support in the northeast asia though , particularly in japan , the only country to have suffered nuclear bombardment .
the hatoyama government is seeking to denuclearize northeast asia as one of its top priorities , says key-young son an expert on international affairs in japan .
he says any signs from the us towards denuclearization will also give a fresh push to the six party talks on north korea 's nuclear program that have remain stalled for the last few years and which aim at paving the way for a nuclear free korean peninsula : " one of the reasons why north korea is hesitating to take steps forward is that the north korean government does n't believe in any intentions of the obama administration , " says key-young son .
" if the obama administration is moving to build trust in terms of nuclear issues , i think it will obviously help in the restart of nuclear talks and also it might change the attitude of north korea in a more positive direction in the near future . "
during his prague speech , obama admitted that the goal of a nuclear free world would not be reached quickly .
experts say lessons could be learned from the earlier disarmament efforts such as the chemical weapons convention which came into force in 1997 after many long years of negotiation .

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

how are experts in asia reacting to this possible shift in us nuclear policy ? it has been nearly a year since us president barack obama unveiled his vision for a nuclear free world .
in a speech in the czech capital prague last april , he claimed america was committed ' to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons ' .
now his vision seems to be taking shape .
the new us nuclear policy review is expected to be announced in the next few weeks .
and as media reports suggest , the obama administration is likely to reduce its nuclear stockpile drastically and boost its conventional weapons capabilities .
the move will attract a lot of attention in asia , says commodore uday bhaskar , a security analyst in india .
" my sense is that the countries like india are looking at it with a lot of interest because these are objectives that india has been supporting and espousing for many decades and there has not been any serious international effort towards this end for many years . "
role of bigger nuclear powers despite india 's traditional stand on nuclear disarmament , it conducted nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998 and declared that it possessed nuclear capability .
its neighbor pakistan acquired nuclear weapons as well , stressing it needed them for defense against neighbors particularly india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a site of india ’ s nuclear test in 1998 neither country has signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty and experts doubt if they will ever give up their nuclear weapons as long as their relations remain strained .
moreover there is a school of thought that believes that the initiative to eliminate nuclear weapons should come from bigger nuclear powers .
" there are some 23,000 weapons all over the world .
out of this 22,000 are shared between us and russia , " says retired gen. talat masood , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the remaining one thousand are with other countries .
so i do n't think anyone should expect any change among other nuclear powers .
the lead has to come from us , russia , and then followed by other permanent un members and india , pakistan and israel . "
china 's dilemma china , on the other hand , has long maintained that it opposes nuclear proliferation and that its nuclear strategy is purely for self defense .
but its substantial increases in military budgets in recent years have sent signals that it wants to surpass the us as the world 's top military power .
oliver thränert , an expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , explains : " china thinks that the overwhelming superiority of the us in terms of its conventional weaponry means that a world without nuclear weapons would be a world in which the dominance of the us would be even clearer than now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea ’ s nuclear facilities at yongbyon north korea nuclear issue the idea of global nuclear disarmament has got considerable support in the northeast asia though , particularly in japan , the only country to have suffered nuclear bombardment .
the hatoyama government is seeking to denuclearize northeast asia as one of its top priorities , says key-young son an expert on international affairs in japan .
he says any signs from the us towards denuclearization will also give a fresh push to the six party talks on north korea 's nuclear program that have remain stalled for the last few years and which aim at paving the way for a nuclear free korean peninsula : " one of the reasons why north korea is hesitating to take steps forward is that the north korean government does n't believe in any intentions of the obama administration , " says key-young son .
" if the obama administration is moving to build trust in terms of nuclear issues , i think it will obviously help in the restart of nuclear talks and also it might change the attitude of north korea in a more positive direction in the near future . "
during his prague speech , obama admitted that the goal of a nuclear free world would not be reached quickly .
experts say lessons could be learned from the earlier disarmament efforts such as the chemical weapons convention which came into force in 1997 after many long years of negotiation .

the hungarian-born is recognized with this year 's chamisso prize for non-native german authors . it is a freezing cold afternoon in berlin .
outside , people are trudging through the snow with shopping bags ; others are hurrying to crowded trams .
terezia mora is taking refuge in a small courtyard movie theater .

delegates from across china meet once a year to vote on proposed legislation .
and this year a few politicians in particular are in the spotlight . tian 'anmen square , located in the cbd of beijing , is now under tight security .
where tourists from all over the world usually take pictures , there are now police and soldiers .
they are there to keep peace and order for the 3,000 delegates who meet annually to discuss legislation .
skyrocketing real-estate prices , rampant corruption and disparities between the rich and the poor .
political scientist , gu xuewu from bonn university , believes this year , the national people 's congress will focus on domestic affairs .
experts say reorganizing the economy is at the top of the list .
one of beijing 's long term goals is to increase domestic demand and reduce exports .
gu xuewu does not expect anything world-shaking to come out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national people 's congress in beijings great hall of the people of the meeting .
" heads of the party will use the national people 's congress to test the reaction and the atmosphere among the people .
big decisions wo n't be made until after the meeting , when the politbureau meets again . "
the national people 's congress formally represents the voice of the chinese people and it is china 's highest legislative organ .
but the so-called " army of voters " only gives its approval to suggestions made by the party .
it is quite normal to have delegates vote 90 percent in favor on any random topic .
controversial discussions are very rare .
there was one in 1992 , when one third of the delegates voted against the construction of the three gorges dam project .
the npc has no say according to gu , when it comes to political decision making , the national people 's congress has no say : " when it comes to politics , to setting guidelines , political decisions are not made by the congress , but by the politbureau .
it is the party in china that retains the real power . "
what goes on behind the red velvet curtain in the great hall of the people , involves making private pacts and weaving webs of intrigues .
in two years there will be a generation change in party command .
cheng li of the brookings institute in washington says many are likely to be using the congress ' spotlight to spread their names throughout china . li thinks this goes especially for one man : party secretary of the city chongqing , bo xilai .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bo xilai is one of the leaders in spotlight " he is a self-made man , media-friendly and this is just one further event for him .
he already belongs to the 25-member politbureau .
he could very well become a member of the politbureau standing committee in two year 's time . "
the star of chinese politics bo xilai is the new star of the chinese politbureau .
born to a veteran of the revolution , he became known throughout china for cracking down on criminal gangs in chongqing .
the party newspaper named him man of the year .
bo xilai has held many party and government offices .
ex-party leader , jiang zemin , is one of his supporters .
but bo xilai is a controvercial figure .
some party members do n't agree with his take-no-gruff style .
but the people love him , it would seem .
bo 's rival in the fight for a seat in the politbureau standing committee is wang yang .
yang is the head of government in the rich guandong province .
he was a member of the communist youth league and is said to be president hu jintao 's protégé .
wang was bo xilai 's predecessor as party secretary of chongqing .
many believe bo xilai 's clampdown against organized crime was born out of spite for his predecessor .
but who will win in this power struggle has yet to be seen .

delegates from across china meet once a year to vote on proposed legislation .
and this year a few politicians in particular are in the spotlight . tian 'anmen square , located in the cbd of beijing , is now under tight security .
where tourists from all over the world usually take pictures , there are now police and soldiers .
they are there to keep peace and order for the 3,000 delegates who meet annually to discuss legislation .
skyrocketing real-estate prices , rampant corruption and disparities between the rich and the poor .
political scientist , gu xuewu from bonn university , believes this year , the national people 's congress will focus on domestic affairs .
experts say reorganizing the economy is at the top of the list .
one of beijing 's long term goals is to increase domestic demand and reduce exports .
gu xuewu does not expect anything world-shaking to come out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national people 's congress in beijings great hall of the people of the meeting .
" heads of the party will use the national people 's congress to test the reaction and the atmosphere among the people .
big decisions wo n't be made until after the meeting , when the politbureau meets again . "
the national people 's congress formally represents the voice of the chinese people and it is china 's highest legislative organ .
but the so-called " army of voters " only gives its approval to suggestions made by the party .
it is quite normal to have delegates vote 90 percent in favor on any random topic .
controversial discussions are very rare .
there was one in 1992 , when one third of the delegates voted against the construction of the three gorges dam project .
the npc has no say according to gu , when it comes to political decision making , the national people 's congress has no say : " when it comes to politics , to setting guidelines , political decisions are not made by the congress , but by the politbureau .
it is the party in china that retains the real power . "
what goes on behind the red velvet curtain in the great hall of the people , involves making private pacts and weaving webs of intrigues .
in two years there will be a generation change in party command .
cheng li of the brookings institute in washington says many are likely to be using the congress ' spotlight to spread their names throughout china . li thinks this goes especially for one man : party secretary of the city chongqing , bo xilai .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bo xilai is one of the leaders in spotlight " he is a self-made man , media-friendly and this is just one further event for him .
he already belongs to the 25-member politbureau .
he could very well become a member of the politbureau standing committee in two year 's time . "
the star of chinese politics bo xilai is the new star of the chinese politbureau .
born to a veteran of the revolution , he became known throughout china for cracking down on criminal gangs in chongqing .
the party newspaper named him man of the year .
bo xilai has held many party and government offices .
ex-party leader , jiang zemin , is one of his supporters .
but bo xilai is a controvercial figure .
some party members do n't agree with his take-no-gruff style .
but the people love him , it would seem .
bo 's rival in the fight for a seat in the politbureau standing committee is wang yang .
yang is the head of government in the rich guandong province .
he was a member of the communist youth league and is said to be president hu jintao 's protégé .
wang was bo xilai 's predecessor as party secretary of chongqing .
many believe bo xilai 's clampdown against organized crime was born out of spite for his predecessor .
but who will win in this power struggle has yet to be seen .

what goes on behind the red velvet curtain in the great hall of the people , involves making private pacts and weaving webs of intrigues .
in two years there will be a generation change in party command .
cheng li of the brookings institute in washington says many are likely to be using the congress ' spotlight to spread their names throughout china . li thinks this goes especially for one man : party secretary of the city chongqing , bo xilai .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bo xilai is one of the leaders in spotlight " he is a self-made man , media-friendly and this is just one further event for him .
he already belongs to the 25-member politbureau .
he could very well become a member of the politbureau standing committee in two year 's time . "
the star of chinese politics bo xilai is the new star of the chinese politbureau .
born to a veteran of the revolution , he became known throughout china for cracking down on criminal gangs in chongqing .
the party newspaper named him man of the year .
bo xilai has held many party and government offices .
ex-party leader , jiang zemin , is one of his supporters .
but bo xilai is a controvercial figure .
some party members do n't agree with his take-no-gruff style .
but the people love him , it would seem .
bo 's rival in the fight for a seat in the politbureau standing committee is wang yang .
yang is the head of government in the rich guandong province .
he was a member of the communist youth league and is said to be president hu jintao 's protégé .
wang was bo xilai 's predecessor as party secretary of chongqing .
many believe bo xilai 's clampdown against organized crime was born out of spite for his predecessor .
but who will win in this power struggle has yet to be seen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 04.03.2010 flat outing shows loew and germany have much to do großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coaching staff have plenty to think about after being outclassed by argentina , it 's clear the german national team have weaknesses in all phases of their game .
dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

the attacks were planned to punish germany for its involvement in afghanistan . a german court has sentenced four self-confessed islamic militants to up to 12 years in jail for a failed plot to attack us targets in germany .
in the country 's biggest terror trial in decades , a higher regional court in duesseldorf sentenced the two german converts , fritz gelowicz and daniel schneider , to 12 years each .
turkish national adem yilmaz was sentenced to 11 years , while german-turkish citizen attila selek will go to jail for five years .
" you were planning a monstrous bloodbath that would have killed an unfathomable number of people , " judge ottmar breidling said at the end of the trial , adding that their goal was to kill at least 150 american soldiers stationed in germany .
" you were blinded by a strange , hate-filled notion of jihad and you turned yourselves into angels of death in the name of islam , " breidling said .
the four defendants in the so-called ' sauerland ' cell had planned a " mass murder unrivaled in germany , " said federal prosecutor volker brinkmann in his closing argument .
" the plot still sends chills down one 's spine .
they appointed themselves masters over life and death . "
defense attorneys , however , called it " the largest failed terrorist attack . "
they had been asking for sentences of under ten years .
the defendants , self-confessed islamic militants , admitted to planning large-scale bomb attacks for the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- against discos and bars frequented by americans , airports and us military facilities in germany .
the attacks had been planned for october 2007 , during a parliament vote to extend german participation in the nato force in afghanistan .
police caught the first three suspects , daniel schneider , fritz gelowicz and adem yilmaz , in september 2007 as they were preparing 410 kilograms of explosives – 100 times the amount used in the 2005 london bombings , prosectors said .
the fourth defendant , atilla selek , was later captured in turkey .
rainer wendt , the head of the german police association , told the bild newspaper 's online editions that the association welcomed the verdict .
" the judgement shows that the german justice system is determined to proceed rigorously and without compromise , " wendt said .
but he also cautioned that " one should not have any illusions that terrorists are deterred by prison sentences . " cmk / afp / ap / dpa / apn editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a first-half strike by gonzalo higuain was enough to secure a 1-0 victory over jogi loew 's hapless men . gonzalo higuain clipped a neat goal over the onrushing german goalkeeper rene adler to give diego maradona 's argentina an away win to a lackluster germany in munich 's allianz stadium .
germany was arguably maradona 's biggest scalp so far in his short career as argentina 's national coach , and the world cup legend made clear afterwards how seriously he had taken the challenge .
" we needed to show ourselves we could do what we did today , " maradona said in the post-match press conference .
" we wanted to show against a good team that we are alive and we understand the moment of the argentine national team , which has not won the world cup for 24 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona claimed his first high-profile scalp in munich reporters could not help but be reminded of the two famous world cup finals , both featuring maradona , germany and argentina fought out in 1986 and 1990 .
adler 's howler the goal that decided wednesday 's friendly came after rene adler 's ill-advised decision to come out for a long ball knocked hopefully into the german half .
real madrid striker higuain , often overlooked by maradona and his predecessor alfio basile , beat adler to the ball by what the keeper later ruefully described as " that famous half-meter " and slotted home the finish .
throughout the rest of an edgy , tactical game , the german defence often resorted to rough-arm tactics to stop argentina 's star attackers lionel messi and angel di maria , though there was nothing they could do to stop a brilliant effort by the benfica player .
collecting veron 's pass about 25 metres from goal , di maria slipped his marker , thumped his shot against the crossbar and appeared to be smacked in the face by a defender immediately afterwards .
argentina dominate veron tried an even more spectacular effort early in the second half when adler failed to clear the ball properly and the estudiantes player lobbed the goalkeeper from about 40 meters only to see his effort just miss the target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friendly was one of the last warm-up games before the world cup germany came to life after cacau replaced the ineffective mesut oezil in the 67th minute , but while the brazilian-born forward tested argentinian keeper sergio romero with a powerful drive , he could do nothing to avert germany 's defeat , which marked the third game without a win for jogi loew 's men .
the frustrated german crowd watched most of the world cup warm-up match in silence , while argentinian supporters cheered as the south american powerhouses stroked the ball around in the dying minutes and greeted the final whistle with a resounding chorus of jeers .
" our mistake was not to take more risks up front , " concluded germany captain michael ballack after the game . according to fifa 's latest world rankings , germany is number five - four places above argentina at nine , one behind england .

a first-half strike by gonzalo higuain was enough to secure a 1-0 victory over jogi loew 's hapless men . gonzalo higuain clipped a neat goal over the onrushing german goalkeeper rene adler to give diego maradona 's argentina an away win to a lackluster germany in munich 's allianz stadium .
germany was arguably maradona 's biggest scalp so far in his short career as argentina 's national coach , and the world cup legend made clear afterwards how seriously he had taken the challenge .
" we needed to show ourselves we could do what we did today , " maradona said in the post-match press conference .
" we wanted to show against a good team that we are alive and we understand the moment of the argentine national team , which has not won the world cup for 24 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona claimed his first high-profile scalp in munich reporters could not help but be reminded of the two famous world cup finals , both featuring maradona , germany and argentina fought out in 1986 and 1990 .
adler 's howler the goal that decided wednesday 's friendly came after rene adler 's ill-advised decision to come out for a long ball knocked hopefully into the german half .
real madrid striker higuain , often overlooked by maradona and his predecessor alfio basile , beat adler to the ball by what the keeper later ruefully described as " that famous half-meter " and slotted home the finish .
throughout the rest of an edgy , tactical game , the german defence often resorted to rough-arm tactics to stop argentina 's star attackers lionel messi and angel di maria , though there was nothing they could do to stop a brilliant effort by the benfica player .
collecting veron 's pass about 25 metres from goal , di maria slipped his marker , thumped his shot against the crossbar and appeared to be smacked in the face by a defender immediately afterwards .
argentina dominate veron tried an even more spectacular effort early in the second half when adler failed to clear the ball properly and the estudiantes player lobbed the goalkeeper from about 40 meters only to see his effort just miss the target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friendly was one of the last warm-up games before the world cup germany came to life after cacau replaced the ineffective mesut oezil in the 67th minute , but while the brazilian-born forward tested argentinian keeper sergio romero with a powerful drive , he could do nothing to avert germany 's defeat , which marked the third game without a win for jogi loew 's men .
the frustrated german crowd watched most of the world cup warm-up match in silence , while argentinian supporters cheered as the south american powerhouses stroked the ball around in the dying minutes and greeted the final whistle with a resounding chorus of jeers .
" our mistake was not to take more risks up front , " concluded germany captain michael ballack after the game . according to fifa 's latest world rankings , germany is number five - four places above argentina at nine , one behind england .

these would be " the most nationally-focused local elections ever , " the leftist volkskrant newspaper said as pollsters predicted a tough ride for the two biggest parties - the christian democratic appeal -lrb- cda -rrb- and the labor party -lrb- pvda -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende 's cabinet collapsed in february rising tide the toughest challenge came from geert wilders ' far-right party for freedom -lrb- pvv -rrb- party , set up in 2006 to " stop the islamization of the netherlands . "
the pvv contested only two cities in its first municipal election , three months ahead of early general elections on june 9 .
the pvv holds nine seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament .
" we 're going to take the netherlands back from the leftist elite that coddles criminals and supports islamization , " freedom party leader geert wilders said early thursday .
wilders ' party came in second in the european elections of june last year , with 16.7 percent of the vote , behind the christian democrats of outgoing premier jan peter balkenende .
according to the results from 96 of the 98 polling stations , the pvv finished substantially ahead of the pvda in almere , with 21.6 percent of the vote .
the pvda , winners of the previous elections in 2006 , got 17.6 percent .
" what is possible in the hague and almere is possible all over the country .
it 's a springboard for our victory , " wilders told his supporters in almere .

most polls had predicted the pvv would come in first in almere , a city of 187,000 inhabitants east of the capital amsterdam , and second or third in the hague - the netherlands ' third largest city with 442,000 residents .

capitalizing on broken coalition pvda leader wouter bos withdrew his party from the national government last month in a spat with balkenende 's cda over extending the dutch military mission in afghanistan .
the cda won 41 seats out of 150 in parliament in the previous round of national elections , the pvda 33 and the pvv nine .
wilders is awaiting trial for alleged hate speech against muslims for having likened the koran to hitler 's " mein kampf " and calling islam a fascist religion .

a first-half strike by gonzalo higuain was enough to secure a 1-0 victory over jogi loew 's hapless men . gonzalo higuain clipped a neat goal over the onrushing german goalkeeper rene adler to give diego maradona 's argentina an away win to a lackluster germany in munich 's allianz stadium .
germany was arguably maradona 's biggest scalp so far in his short career as argentina 's national coach , and the world cup legend made clear afterwards how seriously he had taken the challenge .
" we needed to show ourselves we could do what we did today , " maradona said in the post-match press conference .
" we wanted to show against a good team that we are alive and we understand the moment of the argentine national team , which has not won the world cup for 24 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona claimed his first high-profile scalp in munich reporters could not help but be reminded of the two famous world cup finals , both featuring maradona , germany and argentina fought out in 1986 and 1990 .
adler 's howler the goal that decided wednesday 's friendly came after rene adler 's ill-advised decision to come out for a long ball knocked hopefully into the german half .
real madrid striker higuain , often overlooked by maradona and his predecessor alfio basile , beat adler to the ball by what the keeper later ruefully described as " that famous half-meter " and slotted home the finish .
throughout the rest of an edgy , tactical game , the german defence often resorted to rough-arm tactics to stop argentina 's star attackers lionel messi and angel di maria , though there was nothing they could do to stop a brilliant effort by the benfica player .
collecting veron 's pass about 25 metres from goal , di maria slipped his marker , thumped his shot against the crossbar and appeared to be smacked in the face by a defender immediately afterwards .
argentina dominate veron tried an even more spectacular effort early in the second half when adler failed to clear the ball properly and the estudiantes player lobbed the goalkeeper from about 40 meters only to see his effort just miss the target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friendly was one of the last warm-up games before the world cup germany came to life after cacau replaced the ineffective mesut oezil in the 67th minute , but while the brazilian-born forward tested argentinian keeper sergio romero with a powerful drive , he could do nothing to avert germany 's defeat , which marked the third game without a win for jogi loew 's men .
the frustrated german crowd watched most of the world cup warm-up match in silence , while argentinian supporters cheered as the south american powerhouses stroked the ball around in the dying minutes and greeted the final whistle with a resounding chorus of jeers .
" our mistake was not to take more risks up front , " concluded germany captain michael ballack after the game . according to fifa 's latest world rankings , germany is number five - four places above argentina at nine , one behind england .

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

" we have international stars like rihanna or robbie williams , who will perform in english , and we have artists like peter maffay , who will present his songs in german , " knoell said . in addition to the usual categories of " best artist " , and " best band , " the echo awards also feature nominations for the best german folk music and best german " schlager " singer . sold-out show this year 's echo event is noticeably smaller than last year 's , which boasted a record audience of 10,000 fans in the o2 arena in berlin .
but the tickets for the 2010 echos awards , which will be held at a smaller venue with space for about 4,000 guests , were still a hot commodity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 04.03.2010 flat outing shows loew and germany have much to do großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coaching staff have plenty to think about after being outclassed by argentina , it 's clear the german national team have weaknesses in all phases of their game .
dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .

so are consumers safe here in germany ?

germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .

the attacks were planned to punish germany for its involvement in afghanistan . a german court has sentenced four self-confessed islamic militants to up to 12 years in jail for a failed plot to attack us targets in germany .
in the country 's biggest terror trial in decades , a higher regional court in duesseldorf sentenced the two german converts , fritz gelowicz and daniel schneider , to 12 years each .
turkish national adem yilmaz was sentenced to 11 years , while german-turkish citizen attila selek will go to jail for five years .
" you were planning a monstrous bloodbath that would have killed an unfathomable number of people , " judge ottmar breidling said at the end of the trial , adding that their goal was to kill at least 150 american soldiers stationed in germany .
" you were blinded by a strange , hate-filled notion of jihad and you turned yourselves into angels of death in the name of islam , " breidling said .
the four defendants in the so-called ' sauerland ' cell had planned a " mass murder unrivaled in germany , " said federal prosecutor volker brinkmann in his closing argument .
" the plot still sends chills down one 's spine .
they appointed themselves masters over life and death . "
defense attorneys , however , called it " the largest failed terrorist attack . "
they had been asking for sentences of under ten years .
the defendants , self-confessed islamic militants , admitted to planning large-scale bomb attacks for the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- against discos and bars frequented by americans , airports and us military facilities in germany .
the attacks had been planned for october 2007 , during a parliament vote to extend german participation in the nato force in afghanistan .

dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

experts say misguided sanctions are the wrong approach and counterproductive . on tuesday , the european union pledged to provide 17.3 million euros -lrb- $ 23.4 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid this year to burma .
most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .
while the eu aid package may provide much needed short-term help for burma , also know as myanmar , which ranks 138th out of 182 nations in the united nation 's human development index , it does n't address the most critical issue in europe 's dealings with the country , say experts .
since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "
bildunterschrift : the military rules with an iron fist over burma while the eu and the us have slapped sanctions against burma , most other countries have not , making it easy for the regime to circumvent the sanctions by dealing with other nations . " myanmar is ravaged by chinese businesses that extract natural resources , " says swanström .
" we have no possibility to influence that , so in a sense we lose every possibility to have an impact . "
counterproductive measures what 's more , says michael von hauff , an economist and burma expert at the university of kaiserslautern , the sanctions are not just ineffective , they are actually counterproductive and hurt not the ruling clique , but the burmese people .
" the living conditions of the people have deteriorated and for example many young women in the textile sector lost their jobs , " he told deutsche welle . recent events tend to underscore the experts ' perception that the junta 's demeanor and stance has not been altered by the sanctions regime .
last month , an american citizen and human rights activist was sentenced to five years in prison for forging an identity card .
shortly thereafter , four other human rights activists were sentenced to prison terms on the day of the arrival of the un 's human rights envoy .
during his five day-trip , un envoy tomas ojea quintana was n't allowed to visit aung san suu kyi .
instead of sanctions , the eu should try to engage in a dialogue with the regime .
this dialogue policy should n't focus primarily on the junta leaders , but rather on mid-level government officials , says von hauff .
he has been travelling to burma regularly since 2001 to hold seminars and made an important observation : " it was really interesting that most of the people from the ministries were very open .
we could discuss all the problems and also the human rights situation .
so we should have a differentiated picture of the country . "

only than can it regain any possible leverage on the junta , which it lost through the sanctions .
whether and when that could happen neither of the experts venture to say .
the push to change the eu 's policy toward burma could come once again from the us .
washington has recently sent some signals that it is rethinking its sanctions regime . should washington decide to change its policy , the eu would probably do so as well , says von hauff .
" i have the feeling that we have the sanctions because the united states has sanctions and so the eu has to have sanctions as well . "

as brussels painstakingly deliberates the merits of aspiring european union members in the balkans , beijing has begun an investment offensive in the region .
but is china ’ s money talking economics or politics ? last year , presidents hu jintao of china and boris tadic of serbia cemented their bilateral relations and traditional friendship with a strategic partnership .
besides reaffirming their mutual respect for one another 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , pledging broader , stronger and deeper ties , the two republics firmly stated their aim to promote economic cooperation and trade .
a document resulting from their partnership agreement said the two sides had expressed a readiness to “ ensure continuous and steady growth of bilateral trade and gradually improve the balance of bilateral trade through development in accordance with the principle of equality , mutual benefit , reciprocity and win-win result . ”
a few months down the line the export import bank of china -lrb- china eximbank -rrb- has granted belgrade a billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- loan to upgrade two power plants and build a much-needed bridge over the beautiful blue danube .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bridge would help unclog belgrade 's traffic the bridge project , which is due to get underway in the spring , is critical both as a means of easing the traffic situation in belgrade , and as a test of how well china can work with its south-eastern european partner .
an official from the cabinet of serbia 's national investment plan -lrb- nip -rrb- , who preferred not to be named , told deutsche welle that continued chinese presence in the region hinges on the success of the bridge scheme . " there are a lot of projects we would like the chinese to do , " he said .
" but they want to see how it turns out first . "
what 's good for one … and serbia is not the only country in the balkans which embraces the idea of a free-flowing yuan .
dusan reljic from the eu external relations division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that chinese presence is gathering momentum right across the region .
" the chinese are in slovenia , in macedonia , they 're exporting buses to skopje , they 're talking to croatia about transport facilities , harbors , airports , railway connections , " he said " and they 've been talking to the greeks about leasing possibilities in athens harbor . "
analysts have described china 's arrival in the balkans as an effort to get into europe through the back door .
but kerry brown of the asia program at london 's chatham house , disputes the need for sneaking in through the rear when the " front door is wide open . "
citing telecommunications and automotive high-tech retail industries as examples , he told deutsche welle that chinese investors are already in europe .
win-win result ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pireus harbor in athens dusan reljic agrees , but says taking the direct route to greater eu presence would be more costly for china than investing in territories poised to join within the next 10 to 15 years .
" it 's cheaper to buy assets there -lsb- southern-eastern europe -rsb- than within the present european union , " the expert said .
a cheap ride for china , but what 's in it for the conduit countries like serbia ?
" a good deal , " says reljic .
with very little direct foreign investment coming into the region , tight government budgets and unemployment rates on the rise again , he says balkan states need and welcome china 's money , which comes with grace periods , generously low interest rates and very few strings attached .
" the chinese do not attach economic or political conditions to their loans , " reljic said .
" in a way , cheap chinese money is an alternative to commercially expensive western money or politically expensive money from the international monetary fund or the world bank . "
the politics of economics but money is not the only factor at play .
reljic says beijing 's activities in the balkans are as much about political positioning as they are about financial returns .
" this increased presence is also a signal to the us and the west that china is no longer a peripheral world power , but it is the world power and it is engaging in all political developments throughout the world with its own agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kosovo is serbia " graffiti is testimony to kosovo 's disputed independence an example of that agenda is beijing 's vehement opposition to kosovo 's independence .
china recently spoke out against kosovo 's split from serbia at the international court of justice in the hague .
yet many analysts would say such public displays of support have less to do with china 's concern over stability in the balkans region than with a concern that its own minority groups might follow kosovo 's lead towards independence .
and that , says kerry brown is " absolutely not what they want . "
weighing it up so what do they want ?
" china wants to remake the world and is disappointed that the world wo n't comply . "
brown said .
" it is guided by self-interest and is happy to abuse friendships . "
he says china , which has itself stated its national aim of becoming a strong and wealthy country , is often hard for foreign partners to understand , which is why smaller countries like those in the balkans should be aware of what they want from a partnership with beijing .
" if countries say yes to everything , they have the complication of becoming a tributary state of china . "
but the nip official told deutsche welle such problems would not arise between belgrade and beijing .
" according to domestic law , we are obliged to hire third-party supervision , " he said .
" the chinese will not be given free reign to do whatever they want , no matter who they are dealing with . "

dusan reljic from the eu external relations division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that chinese presence is gathering momentum right across the region .
" the chinese are in slovenia , in macedonia , they 're exporting buses to skopje , they 're talking to croatia about transport facilities , harbors , airports , railway connections , " he said " and they 've been talking to the greeks about leasing possibilities in athens harbor . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pireus harbor in athens dusan reljic agrees , but says taking the direct route to greater eu presence would be more costly for china than investing in territories poised to join within the next 10 to 15 years .
" it 's cheaper to buy assets there -lsb- southern-eastern europe -rsb- than within the present european union , " the expert said .
a cheap ride for china , but what 's in it for the conduit countries like serbia ?
" a good deal , " says reljic .
with very little direct foreign investment coming into the region , tight government budgets and unemployment rates on the rise again , he says balkan states need and welcome china 's money , which comes with grace periods , generously low interest rates and very few strings attached .
" the chinese do not attach economic or political conditions to their loans , " reljic said .
" in a way , cheap chinese money is an alternative to commercially expensive western money or politically expensive money from the international monetary fund or the world bank . "
the politics of economics but money is not the only factor at play .
reljic says beijing 's activities in the balkans are as much about political positioning as they are about financial returns .
" this increased presence is also a signal to the us and the west that china is no longer a peripheral world power , but it is the world power and it is engaging in all political developments throughout the world with its own agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kosovo is serbia " graffiti is testimony to kosovo 's disputed independence an example of that agenda is beijing 's vehement opposition to kosovo 's independence .
china recently spoke out against kosovo 's split from serbia at the international court of justice in the hague .
yet many analysts would say such public displays of support have less to do with china 's concern over stability in the balkans region than with a concern that its own minority groups might follow kosovo 's lead towards independence .
and that , says kerry brown is " absolutely not what they want . "
weighing it up so what do they want ?
" china wants to remake the world and is disappointed that the world wo n't comply . "
brown said .
" it is guided by self-interest and is happy to abuse friendships . "
he says china , which has itself stated its national aim of becoming a strong and wealthy country , is often hard for foreign partners to understand , which is why smaller countries like those in the balkans should be aware of what they want from a partnership with beijing .
" if countries say yes to everything , they have the complication of becoming a tributary state of china . "
but the nip official told deutsche welle such problems would not arise between belgrade and beijing .
" according to domestic law , we are obliged to hire third-party supervision , " he said .
" the chinese will not be given free reign to do whatever they want , no matter who they are dealing with . "

as brussels painstakingly deliberates the merits of aspiring european union members in the balkans , beijing has begun an investment offensive in the region .
but is china ’ s money talking economics or politics ? last year , presidents hu jintao of china and boris tadic of serbia cemented their bilateral relations and traditional friendship with a strategic partnership .
besides reaffirming their mutual respect for one another 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , pledging broader , stronger and deeper ties , the two republics firmly stated their aim to promote economic cooperation and trade .

according to director uwe neumaerker , more than two-thirds of the slabs are damaged , and experts so far have found no remedy .
germany 's mass circulation daily bild reported that as many as 2,200 slabs - more than three-quarters of all the stone elements - have developed cracks due to frost and other weather factors .
the paper cited experts who say the whole memorial , which originally cost nearly 28 million euros -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- , may have to be razed due to the instability of the slabs .
wrong kind of instability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the holocaust memorial at the unveiling of the monument in berlin five years ago , us architect peter eisenman said the work was " not too esthetic , and , of course , the experience of uncertainty and instability that we wanted is present in the memorial . "
at the time , he was clearly referring to the concept of his design and not to any sort of physical instability of the stones that form the pillars of the memorial field .
reports of some of the concrete slabs showing thin cracks first appeared in the media four years ago .
adam kerpel-fronius , from the memorial foundation , told deutsche welle that the problem was not new .
" this memorial site is not a small place .
we ourselves need about three days to look at all the slabs and find the cracks .
we do this on an annual basis to find out the state the memorial is in .
we last did so in october , and we 'll certainly do it again when the winter is over , " he said .
the cause is still unknown there have been attempts in the past to repair the damage with a synthetic resin injected into the cracks .
however , these attempts have not produced the desired results and a better technical solution , which would also better reflect the esthetic considerations , is not yet in sight .
mr. fronius said it was not even clear whether the increase in the number of cracks was really a direct result of the harsh winter weather .
he said a study has been commissioned to get to the heart of the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial has attracted more than eight million visitors " we are trying to find out , because scientifically it 's not established yet why the cracks appeared in the first place .
we do n't know , and the company -lrb- that built the memorial -rrb- does n't seem to know .
so , we have to establish the facts first , and that process is going on , " he said .
memorial still safe for visitors while the foundation admits that more and more cracks have appeared over time , it hastens to add that a structural analysis shows that the slabs are safe and are by no means in the process of falling apart , or of posing a danger to the visitors who walk around amongst them .
the foundation vehemently rejected the view voiced by the unnamed experts in the bild newspaper report , who suggested that the only solution would be to tear down the slabs and rebuild the memorial with more crack-resistant materials .
since the holocaust memorial opened , the field of slabs and the adjacent underground exhibition center have been a magnet for visitors .
over eight million people have walked through the monument , which is a stone 's throw from the reichstag and the brandenburg gate .

delegates from across china meet once a year to vote on proposed legislation .
and this year a few politicians in particular are in the spotlight . tian 'anmen square , located in the cbd of beijing , is now under tight security .
where tourists from all over the world usually take pictures , there are now police and soldiers .
they are there to keep peace and order for the 3,000 delegates who meet annually to discuss legislation .
skyrocketing real-estate prices , rampant corruption and disparities between the rich and the poor .
political scientist , gu xuewu from bonn university , believes this year , the national people 's congress will focus on domestic affairs .
experts say reorganizing the economy is at the top of the list .
one of beijing 's long term goals is to increase domestic demand and reduce exports .
gu xuewu does not expect anything world-shaking to come out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national people 's congress in beijings great hall of the people of the meeting .
" heads of the party will use the national people 's congress to test the reaction and the atmosphere among the people .
big decisions wo n't be made until after the meeting , when the politbureau meets again . "
the national people 's congress formally represents the voice of the chinese people and it is china 's highest legislative organ .
but the so-called " army of voters " only gives its approval to suggestions made by the party .
it is quite normal to have delegates vote 90 percent in favor on any random topic .
controversial discussions are very rare .
there was one in 1992 , when one third of the delegates voted against the construction of the three gorges dam project .
the npc has no say according to gu , when it comes to political decision making , the national people 's congress has no say : " when it comes to politics , to setting guidelines , political decisions are not made by the congress , but by the politbureau .
it is the party in china that retains the real power . "
what goes on behind the red velvet curtain in the great hall of the people , involves making private pacts and weaving webs of intrigues .
in two years there will be a generation change in party command .
cheng li of the brookings institute in washington says many are likely to be using the congress ' spotlight to spread their names throughout china . li thinks this goes especially for one man : party secretary of the city chongqing , bo xilai .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bo xilai is one of the leaders in spotlight " he is a self-made man , media-friendly and this is just one further event for him .
he already belongs to the 25-member politbureau .
he could very well become a member of the politbureau standing committee in two year 's time . "
the star of chinese politics bo xilai is the new star of the chinese politbureau .
born to a veteran of the revolution , he became known throughout china for cracking down on criminal gangs in chongqing .
the party newspaper named him man of the year .
bo xilai has held many party and government offices .
ex-party leader , jiang zemin , is one of his supporters .
but bo xilai is a controvercial figure .
some party members do n't agree with his take-no-gruff style .
but the people love him , it would seem .
bo 's rival in the fight for a seat in the politbureau standing committee is wang yang .
yang is the head of government in the rich guandong province .
he was a member of the communist youth league and is said to be president hu jintao 's protégé .
wang was bo xilai 's predecessor as party secretary of chongqing .
many believe bo xilai 's clampdown against organized crime was born out of spite for his predecessor .
but who will win in this power struggle has yet to be seen .

the hungarian-born is recognized with this year 's chamisso prize for non-native german authors . it is a freezing cold afternoon in berlin .
outside , people are trudging through the snow with shopping bags ; others are hurrying to crowded trams .
terezia mora is taking refuge in a small courtyard movie theater .
the window panes are fogged up and the interior is glaringly empty . to lose herself in a film , to have the whole screen for herself while everyone else is working , to disappear in a hectic rush - for terezia mora , this is a pleasant distraction from writing .
and it reminds her of the 1990s , when she left hungary at the age of 19 to study in germany . " i went to the movies almost seven times a week because that 's what i had missed the most in my little home village , " explained mora .
" here in berlin i could really feel free . "
bleak no-man 's land terezia mora was born in hungary and her family belonged to the country 's german minority .
for her , being in berlin shortly after the fall of the berlin wall was a form of liberation - away from a strict communist society , submerged in an unfinished city open to experiments .
she began to study screenwriting - probably a reason why many of her later stories have a cinematic verve to them and contain precise dialogue . she wrote her first literary text in german and gave a reading at a public event , more out of curiosity than anything else .
soon after that she received a contract with a renowned publishing company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the only man on the continent " wants to escape his reality she named her book of short stories " seltsame materie " -lrb- " strange material " -rrb- - a collection of raw , somber tales from her own childhood .
they are stories from a no-man 's land , somewhere between hungary and austria . " maybe if i had stayed there , i would have never become a writer , " said mora . for mora , german is the language of her own books - hungarian is the language of others .
her other job is translating hungarian literature into german .
for her , writing has something to do with time , the ordering of memories and the relaxing of the mind . this is a slow process , which is why mora only publishes one book every five years .
often she writes from the perspective of strange male characters . " if i were to write about women , i would reveal more about myself than i want to , " said the author . lost in the net a recurring theme in mora 's books is communication - people who are linguistically uprooted and can not find emotional stability .
in her debut novel " day in day out " she tells the story of a balkan refugee in western europe , a brilliant man who speaks 10 languages but somehow can not make himself understood in any of them . her last novel " the only man on the continent " describes a week in the life of an overweight computer nerd , darius kopp .
he works for an international company , but then the collapsing global economy affects his job , leaving him insecure and depressed - a man with no control over his feelings or his finances . through his character , mora wanted to depict " someone who flees to this artificial internet world , " which is " both tragic and comical . " outside the box bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mora achieves self-expression in german mora can walk the literary tightrope like few others can .
she can alter moods and perspectives virtuously and suddenly ; passionate inner monologues collide with sober comments , flowing out of detailed observations .
she dissects the german language , exploiting its potential to the full . despite her talent , mora was labeled a foreigner at first , a common experience for authors with an immigrant background . " that irritated me for a long while , " said mora .
" now , authors like me are so present that people just have to get used to us . " mora 's books are praised by critics and distinguished with awards like the ingeborg bachmann prize and now the chamisso prize , which is awarded annually by the robert bosch foundation to non-germans who publish literary works in the german language .
despite this , she can deal well with people 's high expectations of her . " i know that all of things can not change the substance of who i am , " said mora confidently . nevertheless , the money that comes from awards - including 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 20,300 -rrb- from the chamisso prize - is important to her , since with the distinction alone she " ca n't buy any flower pots " for herself , she said . after all , mora lives from her writing .
she has her feet firmly on the ground , both as an author and as the mother of a young daughter .
she does not fit the cliche of the dreamy writer distanced from the world around them .
for her , writing means taking a close look when certainties evaporate and borderlines disintegrate . author : aygul cizmecioglu -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a first-half strike by gonzalo higuain was enough to secure a 1-0 victory over jogi loew 's hapless men . gonzalo higuain clipped a neat goal over the onrushing german goalkeeper rene adler to give diego maradona 's argentina an away win to a lackluster germany in munich 's allianz stadium .
germany was arguably maradona 's biggest scalp so far in his short career as argentina 's national coach , and the world cup legend made clear afterwards how seriously he had taken the challenge .
" we needed to show ourselves we could do what we did today , " maradona said in the post-match press conference .
" we wanted to show against a good team that we are alive and we understand the moment of the argentine national team , which has not won the world cup for 24 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona claimed his first high-profile scalp in munich reporters could not help but be reminded of the two famous world cup finals , both featuring maradona , germany and argentina fought out in 1986 and 1990 .
adler 's howler the goal that decided wednesday 's friendly came after rene adler 's ill-advised decision to come out for a long ball knocked hopefully into the german half .
real madrid striker higuain , often overlooked by maradona and his predecessor alfio basile , beat adler to the ball by what the keeper later ruefully described as " that famous half-meter " and slotted home the finish .
throughout the rest of an edgy , tactical game , the german defence often resorted to rough-arm tactics to stop argentina 's star attackers lionel messi and angel di maria , though there was nothing they could do to stop a brilliant effort by the benfica player .
collecting veron 's pass about 25 metres from goal , di maria slipped his marker , thumped his shot against the crossbar and appeared to be smacked in the face by a defender immediately afterwards .
argentina dominate veron tried an even more spectacular effort early in the second half when adler failed to clear the ball properly and the estudiantes player lobbed the goalkeeper from about 40 meters only to see his effort just miss the target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friendly was one of the last warm-up games before the world cup germany came to life after cacau replaced the ineffective mesut oezil in the 67th minute , but while the brazilian-born forward tested argentinian keeper sergio romero with a powerful drive , he could do nothing to avert germany 's defeat , which marked the third game without a win for jogi loew 's men .
the frustrated german crowd watched most of the world cup warm-up match in silence , while argentinian supporters cheered as the south american powerhouses stroked the ball around in the dying minutes and greeted the final whistle with a resounding chorus of jeers .
" our mistake was not to take more risks up front , " concluded germany captain michael ballack after the game . according to fifa 's latest world rankings , germany is number five - four places above argentina at nine , one behind england .

the attacks were planned to punish germany for its involvement in afghanistan . a german court has sentenced four self-confessed islamic militants to up to 12 years in jail for a failed plot to attack us targets in germany .
in the country 's biggest terror trial in decades , a higher regional court in duesseldorf sentenced the two german converts , fritz gelowicz and daniel schneider , to 12 years each .
turkish national adem yilmaz was sentenced to 11 years , while german-turkish citizen attila selek will go to jail for five years .
" you were planning a monstrous bloodbath that would have killed an unfathomable number of people , " judge ottmar breidling said at the end of the trial , adding that their goal was to kill at least 150 american soldiers stationed in germany .
" you were blinded by a strange , hate-filled notion of jihad and you turned yourselves into angels of death in the name of islam , " breidling said .
the four defendants in the so-called ' sauerland ' cell had planned a " mass murder unrivaled in germany , " said federal prosecutor volker brinkmann in his closing argument .
" the plot still sends chills down one 's spine .
they appointed themselves masters over life and death . "
defense attorneys , however , called it " the largest failed terrorist attack . "
they had been asking for sentences of under ten years .
the defendants , self-confessed islamic militants , admitted to planning large-scale bomb attacks for the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- against discos and bars frequented by americans , airports and us military facilities in germany .
the attacks had been planned for october 2007 , during a parliament vote to extend german participation in the nato force in afghanistan .
police caught the first three suspects , daniel schneider , fritz gelowicz and adem yilmaz , in september 2007 as they were preparing 410 kilograms of explosives – 100 times the amount used in the 2005 london bombings , prosectors said .
the fourth defendant , atilla selek , was later captured in turkey .
rainer wendt , the head of the german police association , told the bild newspaper 's online editions that the association welcomed the verdict .
" the judgement shows that the german justice system is determined to proceed rigorously and without compromise , " wendt said .
but he also cautioned that " one should not have any illusions that terrorists are deterred by prison sentences . " cmk / afp / ap / dpa / apn editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 04.03.2010 winter weather is bad news for berlin 's holocaust memorial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracks are both a dilemma and an embarrassment berlin 's holocaust memorial has cracks in a large number of concrete slabs that form the centerpiece of the site near the german capital 's reichstag parliament building . the director of the foundation that oversees the memorial , which commemorates those killed by the nazi regime under adolf hitler , says most of the 2,711 concrete slabs are damaged only five years after the monument opened .
according to director uwe neumaerker , more than two-thirds of the slabs are damaged , and experts so far have found no remedy .
germany 's mass circulation daily bild reported that as many as 2,200 slabs - more than three-quarters of all the stone elements - have developed cracks due to frost and other weather factors .
the paper cited experts who say the whole memorial , which originally cost nearly 28 million euros -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- , may have to be razed due to the instability of the slabs .
wrong kind of instability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the holocaust memorial at the unveiling of the monument in berlin five years ago , us architect peter eisenman said the work was " not too esthetic , and , of course , the experience of uncertainty and instability that we wanted is present in the memorial . "
at the time , he was clearly referring to the concept of his design and not to any sort of physical instability of the stones that form the pillars of the memorial field .
reports of some of the concrete slabs showing thin cracks first appeared in the media four years ago .
adam kerpel-fronius , from the memorial foundation , told deutsche welle that the problem was not new .
" this memorial site is not a small place .
we ourselves need about three days to look at all the slabs and find the cracks .
we do this on an annual basis to find out the state the memorial is in .
we last did so in october , and we 'll certainly do it again when the winter is over , " he said .
the cause is still unknown there have been attempts in the past to repair the damage with a synthetic resin injected into the cracks .
however , these attempts have not produced the desired results and a better technical solution , which would also better reflect the esthetic considerations , is not yet in sight .
mr. fronius said it was not even clear whether the increase in the number of cracks was really a direct result of the harsh winter weather .
he said a study has been commissioned to get to the heart of the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial has attracted more than eight million visitors " we are trying to find out , because scientifically it 's not established yet why the cracks appeared in the first place .
we do n't know , and the company -lrb- that built the memorial -rrb- does n't seem to know .
so , we have to establish the facts first , and that process is going on , " he said .
memorial still safe for visitors while the foundation admits that more and more cracks have appeared over time , it hastens to add that a structural analysis shows that the slabs are safe and are by no means in the process of falling apart , or of posing a danger to the visitors who walk around amongst them .
the foundation vehemently rejected the view voiced by the unnamed experts in the bild newspaper report , who suggested that the only solution would be to tear down the slabs and rebuild the memorial with more crack-resistant materials .
since the holocaust memorial opened , the field of slabs and the adjacent underground exhibition center have been a magnet for visitors .
over eight million people have walked through the monument , which is a stone 's throw from the reichstag and the brandenburg gate .

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

delegates from across china meet once a year to vote on proposed legislation .
and this year a few politicians in particular are in the spotlight . tian 'anmen square , located in the cbd of beijing , is now under tight security .
where tourists from all over the world usually take pictures , there are now police and soldiers .
they are there to keep peace and order for the 3,000 delegates who meet annually to discuss legislation .
skyrocketing real-estate prices , rampant corruption and disparities between the rich and the poor .
political scientist , gu xuewu from bonn university , believes this year , the national people 's congress will focus on domestic affairs .
experts say reorganizing the economy is at the top of the list .
one of beijing 's long term goals is to increase domestic demand and reduce exports .
gu xuewu does not expect anything world-shaking to come out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national people 's congress in beijings great hall of the people of the meeting .
" heads of the party will use the national people 's congress to test the reaction and the atmosphere among the people .
big decisions wo n't be made until after the meeting , when the politbureau meets again . "
the national people 's congress formally represents the voice of the chinese people and it is china 's highest legislative organ .
but the so-called " army of voters " only gives its approval to suggestions made by the party .
it is quite normal to have delegates vote 90 percent in favor on any random topic .
controversial discussions are very rare .
there was one in 1992 , when one third of the delegates voted against the construction of the three gorges dam project .
the npc has no say according to gu , when it comes to political decision making , the national people 's congress has no say : " when it comes to politics , to setting guidelines , political decisions are not made by the congress , but by the politbureau .
it is the party in china that retains the real power . "
what goes on behind the red velvet curtain in the great hall of the people , involves making private pacts and weaving webs of intrigues .
in two years there will be a generation change in party command .
cheng li of the brookings institute in washington says many are likely to be using the congress ' spotlight to spread their names throughout china . li thinks this goes especially for one man : party secretary of the city chongqing , bo xilai .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bo xilai is one of the leaders in spotlight " he is a self-made man , media-friendly and this is just one further event for him .
he already belongs to the 25-member politbureau .
he could very well become a member of the politbureau standing committee in two year 's time . "
the star of chinese politics bo xilai is the new star of the chinese politbureau .
born to a veteran of the revolution , he became known throughout china for cracking down on criminal gangs in chongqing .
the party newspaper named him man of the year .
bo xilai has held many party and government offices .
ex-party leader , jiang zemin , is one of his supporters .
but bo xilai is a controvercial figure .
some party members do n't agree with his take-no-gruff style .
but the people love him , it would seem .
bo 's rival in the fight for a seat in the politbureau standing committee is wang yang .
yang is the head of government in the rich guandong province .
he was a member of the communist youth league and is said to be president hu jintao 's protégé .
wang was bo xilai 's predecessor as party secretary of chongqing .
many believe bo xilai 's clampdown against organized crime was born out of spite for his predecessor .
but who will win in this power struggle has yet to be seen .

besides reaffirming their mutual respect for one another 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , pledging broader , stronger and deeper ties , the two republics firmly stated their aim to promote economic cooperation and trade .
a document resulting from their partnership agreement said the two sides had expressed a readiness to “ ensure continuous and steady growth of bilateral trade and gradually improve the balance of bilateral trade through development in accordance with the principle of equality , mutual benefit , reciprocity and win-win result . ”
a few months down the line the export import bank of china -lrb- china eximbank -rrb- has granted belgrade a billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- loan to upgrade two power plants and build a much-needed bridge over the beautiful blue danube .

dusan reljic from the eu external relations division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that chinese presence is gathering momentum right across the region .
" the chinese are in slovenia , in macedonia , they 're exporting buses to skopje , they 're talking to croatia about transport facilities , harbors , airports , railway connections , " he said " and they 've been talking to the greeks about leasing possibilities in athens harbor . "
analysts have described china 's arrival in the balkans as an effort to get into europe through the back door .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pireus harbor in athens dusan reljic agrees , but says taking the direct route to greater eu presence would be more costly for china than investing in territories poised to join within the next 10 to 15 years .

with very little direct foreign investment coming into the region , tight government budgets and unemployment rates on the rise again , he says balkan states need and welcome china 's money , which comes with grace periods , generously low interest rates and very few strings attached .
" the chinese do not attach economic or political conditions to their loans , " reljic said .
" in a way , cheap chinese money is an alternative to commercially expensive western money or politically expensive money from the international monetary fund or the world bank . "
the politics of economics but money is not the only factor at play .
reljic says beijing 's activities in the balkans are as much about political positioning as they are about financial returns .
" this increased presence is also a signal to the us and the west that china is no longer a peripheral world power , but it is the world power and it is engaging in all political developments throughout the world with its own agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kosovo is serbia " graffiti is testimony to kosovo 's disputed independence an example of that agenda is beijing 's vehement opposition to kosovo 's independence .
china recently spoke out against kosovo 's split from serbia at the international court of justice in the hague .
yet many analysts would say such public displays of support have less to do with china 's concern over stability in the balkans region than with a concern that its own minority groups might follow kosovo 's lead towards independence .

he says china , which has itself stated its national aim of becoming a strong and wealthy country , is often hard for foreign partners to understand , which is why smaller countries like those in the balkans should be aware of what they want from a partnership with beijing .

as brussels painstakingly deliberates the merits of aspiring european union members in the balkans , beijing has begun an investment offensive in the region .
but is china ’ s money talking economics or politics ? last year , presidents hu jintao of china and boris tadic of serbia cemented their bilateral relations and traditional friendship with a strategic partnership .
besides reaffirming their mutual respect for one another 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , pledging broader , stronger and deeper ties , the two republics firmly stated their aim to promote economic cooperation and trade .
a document resulting from their partnership agreement said the two sides had expressed a readiness to “ ensure continuous and steady growth of bilateral trade and gradually improve the balance of bilateral trade through development in accordance with the principle of equality , mutual benefit , reciprocity and win-win result . ”
a few months down the line the export import bank of china -lrb- china eximbank -rrb- has granted belgrade a billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- loan to upgrade two power plants and build a much-needed bridge over the beautiful blue danube .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bridge would help unclog belgrade 's traffic the bridge project , which is due to get underway in the spring , is critical both as a means of easing the traffic situation in belgrade , and as a test of how well china can work with its south-eastern european partner .
an official from the cabinet of serbia 's national investment plan -lrb- nip -rrb- , who preferred not to be named , told deutsche welle that continued chinese presence in the region hinges on the success of the bridge scheme . " there are a lot of projects we would like the chinese to do , " he said .
" but they want to see how it turns out first . "
what 's good for one … and serbia is not the only country in the balkans which embraces the idea of a free-flowing yuan .
dusan reljic from the eu external relations division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that chinese presence is gathering momentum right across the region .
" the chinese are in slovenia , in macedonia , they 're exporting buses to skopje , they 're talking to croatia about transport facilities , harbors , airports , railway connections , " he said " and they 've been talking to the greeks about leasing possibilities in athens harbor . "
analysts have described china 's arrival in the balkans as an effort to get into europe through the back door .
but kerry brown of the asia program at london 's chatham house , disputes the need for sneaking in through the rear when the " front door is wide open . "
citing telecommunications and automotive high-tech retail industries as examples , he told deutsche welle that chinese investors are already in europe .
win-win result ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pireus harbor in athens dusan reljic agrees , but says taking the direct route to greater eu presence would be more costly for china than investing in territories poised to join within the next 10 to 15 years .
" it 's cheaper to buy assets there -lsb- southern-eastern europe -rsb- than within the present european union , " the expert said .
a cheap ride for china , but what 's in it for the conduit countries like serbia ?
" a good deal , " says reljic .
with very little direct foreign investment coming into the region , tight government budgets and unemployment rates on the rise again , he says balkan states need and welcome china 's money , which comes with grace periods , generously low interest rates and very few strings attached .
" the chinese do not attach economic or political conditions to their loans , " reljic said .
" in a way , cheap chinese money is an alternative to commercially expensive western money or politically expensive money from the international monetary fund or the world bank . "
the politics of economics but money is not the only factor at play .
reljic says beijing 's activities in the balkans are as much about political positioning as they are about financial returns .
" this increased presence is also a signal to the us and the west that china is no longer a peripheral world power , but it is the world power and it is engaging in all political developments throughout the world with its own agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kosovo is serbia " graffiti is testimony to kosovo 's disputed independence an example of that agenda is beijing 's vehement opposition to kosovo 's independence .
china recently spoke out against kosovo 's split from serbia at the international court of justice in the hague .
yet many analysts would say such public displays of support have less to do with china 's concern over stability in the balkans region than with a concern that its own minority groups might follow kosovo 's lead towards independence .
and that , says kerry brown is " absolutely not what they want . "
weighing it up so what do they want ?
" china wants to remake the world and is disappointed that the world wo n't comply . "
brown said .
" it is guided by self-interest and is happy to abuse friendships . "
he says china , which has itself stated its national aim of becoming a strong and wealthy country , is often hard for foreign partners to understand , which is why smaller countries like those in the balkans should be aware of what they want from a partnership with beijing .
" if countries say yes to everything , they have the complication of becoming a tributary state of china . "
but the nip official told deutsche welle such problems would not arise between belgrade and beijing .
" according to domestic law , we are obliged to hire third-party supervision , " he said .
" the chinese will not be given free reign to do whatever they want , no matter who they are dealing with . "

an official from the cabinet of serbia 's national investment plan -lrb- nip -rrb- , who preferred not to be named , told deutsche welle that continued chinese presence in the region hinges on the success of the bridge scheme . " there are a lot of projects we would like the chinese to do , " he said .
" but they want to see how it turns out first . "
what 's good for one … and serbia is not the only country in the balkans which embraces the idea of a free-flowing yuan .
dusan reljic from the eu external relations division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that chinese presence is gathering momentum right across the region .
" the chinese are in slovenia , in macedonia , they 're exporting buses to skopje , they 're talking to croatia about transport facilities , harbors , airports , railway connections , " he said " and they 've been talking to the greeks about leasing possibilities in athens harbor . "
analysts have described china 's arrival in the balkans as an effort to get into europe through the back door .
but kerry brown of the asia program at london 's chatham house , disputes the need for sneaking in through the rear when the " front door is wide open . "
citing telecommunications and automotive high-tech retail industries as examples , he told deutsche welle that chinese investors are already in europe .
win-win result ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pireus harbor in athens dusan reljic agrees , but says taking the direct route to greater eu presence would be more costly for china than investing in territories poised to join within the next 10 to 15 years .
" it 's cheaper to buy assets there -lsb- southern-eastern europe -rsb- than within the present european union , " the expert said .
a cheap ride for china , but what 's in it for the conduit countries like serbia ?
" a good deal , " says reljic .
with very little direct foreign investment coming into the region , tight government budgets and unemployment rates on the rise again , he says balkan states need and welcome china 's money , which comes with grace periods , generously low interest rates and very few strings attached .
" the chinese do not attach economic or political conditions to their loans , " reljic said .
" in a way , cheap chinese money is an alternative to commercially expensive western money or politically expensive money from the international monetary fund or the world bank . "
the politics of economics but money is not the only factor at play .
reljic says beijing 's activities in the balkans are as much about political positioning as they are about financial returns .
" this increased presence is also a signal to the us and the west that china is no longer a peripheral world power , but it is the world power and it is engaging in all political developments throughout the world with its own agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kosovo is serbia " graffiti is testimony to kosovo 's disputed independence an example of that agenda is beijing 's vehement opposition to kosovo 's independence .
china recently spoke out against kosovo 's split from serbia at the international court of justice in the hague .
yet many analysts would say such public displays of support have less to do with china 's concern over stability in the balkans region than with a concern that its own minority groups might follow kosovo 's lead towards independence .
and that , says kerry brown is " absolutely not what they want . "
weighing it up so what do they want ?
" china wants to remake the world and is disappointed that the world wo n't comply . "
brown said .
" it is guided by self-interest and is happy to abuse friendships . "
he says china , which has itself stated its national aim of becoming a strong and wealthy country , is often hard for foreign partners to understand , which is why smaller countries like those in the balkans should be aware of what they want from a partnership with beijing .
" if countries say yes to everything , they have the complication of becoming a tributary state of china . "
but the nip official told deutsche welle such problems would not arise between belgrade and beijing .
" according to domestic law , we are obliged to hire third-party supervision , " he said .
" the chinese will not be given free reign to do whatever they want , no matter who they are dealing with . "

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .

so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .

are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 04.03.2010 eu should drop failed sanctions policy against burma , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu sanctions have failed to win the release of burmese opposition leader aung san suu kyi while the eu announced a humanitarian aid package for burma this week , it left in place its 14-year old sanctions regime against the country .
experts say misguided sanctions are the wrong approach and counterproductive . on tuesday , the european union pledged to provide 17.3 million euros -lrb- $ 23.4 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid this year to burma .
most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .
while the eu aid package may provide much needed short-term help for burma , also know as myanmar , which ranks 138th out of 182 nations in the united nation 's human development index , it does n't address the most critical issue in europe 's dealings with the country , say experts .
since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "
bildunterschrift : the military rules with an iron fist over burma while the eu and the us have slapped sanctions against burma , most other countries have not , making it easy for the regime to circumvent the sanctions by dealing with other nations . " myanmar is ravaged by chinese businesses that extract natural resources , " says swanström .
" we have no possibility to influence that , so in a sense we lose every possibility to have an impact . "

experts say misguided sanctions are the wrong approach and counterproductive . on tuesday , the european union pledged to provide 17.3 million euros -lrb- $ 23.4 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid this year to burma .
most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .
while the eu aid package may provide much needed short-term help for burma , also know as myanmar , which ranks 138th out of 182 nations in the united nation 's human development index , it does n't address the most critical issue in europe 's dealings with the country , say experts .
since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "
bildunterschrift : the military rules with an iron fist over burma while the eu and the us have slapped sanctions against burma , most other countries have not , making it easy for the regime to circumvent the sanctions by dealing with other nations .

" we have no possibility to influence that , so in a sense we lose every possibility to have an impact . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 04.03.2010 winter weather is bad news for berlin 's holocaust memorial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracks are both a dilemma and an embarrassment berlin 's holocaust memorial has cracks in a large number of concrete slabs that form the centerpiece of the site near the german capital 's reichstag parliament building . the director of the foundation that oversees the memorial , which commemorates those killed by the nazi regime under adolf hitler , says most of the 2,711 concrete slabs are damaged only five years after the monument opened .
according to director uwe neumaerker , more than two-thirds of the slabs are damaged , and experts so far have found no remedy .
germany 's mass circulation daily bild reported that as many as 2,200 slabs - more than three-quarters of all the stone elements - have developed cracks due to frost and other weather factors .
the paper cited experts who say the whole memorial , which originally cost nearly 28 million euros -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- , may have to be razed due to the instability of the slabs .
wrong kind of instability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the holocaust memorial at the unveiling of the monument in berlin five years ago , us architect peter eisenman said the work was " not too esthetic , and , of course , the experience of uncertainty and instability that we wanted is present in the memorial . "
at the time , he was clearly referring to the concept of his design and not to any sort of physical instability of the stones that form the pillars of the memorial field .
reports of some of the concrete slabs showing thin cracks first appeared in the media four years ago .
adam kerpel-fronius , from the memorial foundation , told deutsche welle that the problem was not new .
" this memorial site is not a small place .
we ourselves need about three days to look at all the slabs and find the cracks .
we do this on an annual basis to find out the state the memorial is in .
we last did so in october , and we 'll certainly do it again when the winter is over , " he said .
the cause is still unknown there have been attempts in the past to repair the damage with a synthetic resin injected into the cracks .
however , these attempts have not produced the desired results and a better technical solution , which would also better reflect the esthetic considerations , is not yet in sight .
mr. fronius said it was not even clear whether the increase in the number of cracks was really a direct result of the harsh winter weather .
he said a study has been commissioned to get to the heart of the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial has attracted more than eight million visitors " we are trying to find out , because scientifically it 's not established yet why the cracks appeared in the first place .
we do n't know , and the company -lrb- that built the memorial -rrb- does n't seem to know .
so , we have to establish the facts first , and that process is going on , " he said .
memorial still safe for visitors while the foundation admits that more and more cracks have appeared over time , it hastens to add that a structural analysis shows that the slabs are safe and are by no means in the process of falling apart , or of posing a danger to the visitors who walk around amongst them .
the foundation vehemently rejected the view voiced by the unnamed experts in the bild newspaper report , who suggested that the only solution would be to tear down the slabs and rebuild the memorial with more crack-resistant materials .
since the holocaust memorial opened , the field of slabs and the adjacent underground exhibition center have been a magnet for visitors .
over eight million people have walked through the monument , which is a stone 's throw from the reichstag and the brandenburg gate .

dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .

the hungarian-born is recognized with this year 's chamisso prize for non-native german authors . it is a freezing cold afternoon in berlin .
outside , people are trudging through the snow with shopping bags ; others are hurrying to crowded trams .
terezia mora is taking refuge in a small courtyard movie theater .
the window panes are fogged up and the interior is glaringly empty . to lose herself in a film , to have the whole screen for herself while everyone else is working , to disappear in a hectic rush - for terezia mora , this is a pleasant distraction from writing .
and it reminds her of the 1990s , when she left hungary at the age of 19 to study in germany . " i went to the movies almost seven times a week because that 's what i had missed the most in my little home village , " explained mora .
" here in berlin i could really feel free . "
bleak no-man 's land terezia mora was born in hungary and her family belonged to the country 's german minority .
for her , being in berlin shortly after the fall of the berlin wall was a form of liberation - away from a strict communist society , submerged in an unfinished city open to experiments .
she began to study screenwriting - probably a reason why many of her later stories have a cinematic verve to them and contain precise dialogue . she wrote her first literary text in german and gave a reading at a public event , more out of curiosity than anything else .
soon after that she received a contract with a renowned publishing company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the only man on the continent " wants to escape his reality she named her book of short stories " seltsame materie " -lrb- " strange material " -rrb- - a collection of raw , somber tales from her own childhood .
they are stories from a no-man 's land , somewhere between hungary and austria . " maybe if i had stayed there , i would have never become a writer , " said mora . for mora , german is the language of her own books - hungarian is the language of others .
her other job is translating hungarian literature into german .
for her , writing has something to do with time , the ordering of memories and the relaxing of the mind . this is a slow process , which is why mora only publishes one book every five years .
often she writes from the perspective of strange male characters . " if i were to write about women , i would reveal more about myself than i want to , " said the author . lost in the net a recurring theme in mora 's books is communication - people who are linguistically uprooted and can not find emotional stability .
in her debut novel " day in day out " she tells the story of a balkan refugee in western europe , a brilliant man who speaks 10 languages but somehow can not make himself understood in any of them . her last novel " the only man on the continent " describes a week in the life of an overweight computer nerd , darius kopp .
he works for an international company , but then the collapsing global economy affects his job , leaving him insecure and depressed - a man with no control over his feelings or his finances . through his character , mora wanted to depict " someone who flees to this artificial internet world , " which is " both tragic and comical . " outside the box bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mora achieves self-expression in german mora can walk the literary tightrope like few others can .
she can alter moods and perspectives virtuously and suddenly ; passionate inner monologues collide with sober comments , flowing out of detailed observations .
she dissects the german language , exploiting its potential to the full . despite her talent , mora was labeled a foreigner at first , a common experience for authors with an immigrant background . " that irritated me for a long while , " said mora .
" now , authors like me are so present that people just have to get used to us . " mora 's books are praised by critics and distinguished with awards like the ingeborg bachmann prize and now the chamisso prize , which is awarded annually by the robert bosch foundation to non-germans who publish literary works in the german language .
despite this , she can deal well with people 's high expectations of her . " i know that all of things can not change the substance of who i am , " said mora confidently . nevertheless , the money that comes from awards - including 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 20,300 -rrb- from the chamisso prize - is important to her , since with the distinction alone she " ca n't buy any flower pots " for herself , she said . after all , mora lives from her writing .
she has her feet firmly on the ground , both as an author and as the mother of a young daughter .
she does not fit the cliche of the dreamy writer distanced from the world around them .

experts say misguided sanctions are the wrong approach and counterproductive . on tuesday , the european union pledged to provide 17.3 million euros -lrb- $ 23.4 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid this year to burma .
most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .
while the eu aid package may provide much needed short-term help for burma , also know as myanmar , which ranks 138th out of 182 nations in the united nation 's human development index , it does n't address the most critical issue in europe 's dealings with the country , say experts .
since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "
bildunterschrift : the military rules with an iron fist over burma while the eu and the us have slapped sanctions against burma , most other countries have not , making it easy for the regime to circumvent the sanctions by dealing with other nations . " myanmar is ravaged by chinese businesses that extract natural resources , " says swanström .
" we have no possibility to influence that , so in a sense we lose every possibility to have an impact . "
counterproductive measures what 's more , says michael von hauff , an economist and burma expert at the university of kaiserslautern , the sanctions are not just ineffective , they are actually counterproductive and hurt not the ruling clique , but the burmese people .
" the living conditions of the people have deteriorated and for example many young women in the textile sector lost their jobs , " he told deutsche welle . recent events tend to underscore the experts ' perception that the junta 's demeanor and stance has not been altered by the sanctions regime .
last month , an american citizen and human rights activist was sentenced to five years in prison for forging an identity card .
shortly thereafter , four other human rights activists were sentenced to prison terms on the day of the arrival of the un 's human rights envoy .
during his five day-trip , un envoy tomas ojea quintana was n't allowed to visit aung san suu kyi .
instead of sanctions , the eu should try to engage in a dialogue with the regime .
this dialogue policy should n't focus primarily on the junta leaders , but rather on mid-level government officials , says von hauff .
he has been travelling to burma regularly since 2001 to hold seminars and made an important observation : " it was really interesting that most of the people from the ministries were very open .
we could discuss all the problems and also the human rights situation .
so we should have a differentiated picture of the country . "
push from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : childen suffer especially from the dismal economic situation in burma but in order to engage the government effectively , the eu must first drop its current failed sanctions policy , argue von hauff and swanström .
only than can it regain any possible leverage on the junta , which it lost through the sanctions .
whether and when that could happen neither of the experts venture to say .
the push to change the eu 's policy toward burma could come once again from the us .
washington has recently sent some signals that it is rethinking its sanctions regime . should washington decide to change its policy , the eu would probably do so as well , says von hauff .
" i have the feeling that we have the sanctions because the united states has sanctions and so the eu has to have sanctions as well . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 04.03.2010 eu should drop failed sanctions policy against burma , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu sanctions have failed to win the release of burmese opposition leader aung san suu kyi while the eu announced a humanitarian aid package for burma this week , it left in place its 14-year old sanctions regime against the country .
experts say misguided sanctions are the wrong approach and counterproductive . on tuesday , the european union pledged to provide 17.3 million euros -lrb- $ 23.4 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid this year to burma .
most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .
while the eu aid package may provide much needed short-term help for burma , also know as myanmar , which ranks 138th out of 182 nations in the united nation 's human development index , it does n't address the most critical issue in europe 's dealings with the country , say experts .
since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "
bildunterschrift : the military rules with an iron fist over burma while the eu and the us have slapped sanctions against burma , most other countries have not , making it easy for the regime to circumvent the sanctions by dealing with other nations . " myanmar is ravaged by chinese businesses that extract natural resources , " says swanström .
" we have no possibility to influence that , so in a sense we lose every possibility to have an impact . "
counterproductive measures what 's more , says michael von hauff , an economist and burma expert at the university of kaiserslautern , the sanctions are not just ineffective , they are actually counterproductive and hurt not the ruling clique , but the burmese people .
" the living conditions of the people have deteriorated and for example many young women in the textile sector lost their jobs , " he told deutsche welle . recent events tend to underscore the experts ' perception that the junta 's demeanor and stance has not been altered by the sanctions regime .
last month , an american citizen and human rights activist was sentenced to five years in prison for forging an identity card .
shortly thereafter , four other human rights activists were sentenced to prison terms on the day of the arrival of the un 's human rights envoy .
during his five day-trip , un envoy tomas ojea quintana was n't allowed to visit aung san suu kyi .
instead of sanctions , the eu should try to engage in a dialogue with the regime .
this dialogue policy should n't focus primarily on the junta leaders , but rather on mid-level government officials , says von hauff .
he has been travelling to burma regularly since 2001 to hold seminars and made an important observation : " it was really interesting that most of the people from the ministries were very open .
we could discuss all the problems and also the human rights situation .
so we should have a differentiated picture of the country . "
push from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : childen suffer especially from the dismal economic situation in burma but in order to engage the government effectively , the eu must first drop its current failed sanctions policy , argue von hauff and swanström .

experts say misguided sanctions are the wrong approach and counterproductive . on tuesday , the european union pledged to provide 17.3 million euros -lrb- $ 23.4 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid this year to burma .
most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .
while the eu aid package may provide much needed short-term help for burma , also know as myanmar , which ranks 138th out of 182 nations in the united nation 's human development index , it does n't address the most critical issue in europe 's dealings with the country , say experts .
since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "
bildunterschrift : the military rules with an iron fist over burma while the eu and the us have slapped sanctions against burma , most other countries have not , making it easy for the regime to circumvent the sanctions by dealing with other nations . " myanmar is ravaged by chinese businesses that extract natural resources , " says swanström .
" we have no possibility to influence that , so in a sense we lose every possibility to have an impact . "
counterproductive measures what 's more , says michael von hauff , an economist and burma expert at the university of kaiserslautern , the sanctions are not just ineffective , they are actually counterproductive and hurt not the ruling clique , but the burmese people .
" the living conditions of the people have deteriorated and for example many young women in the textile sector lost their jobs , " he told deutsche welle . recent events tend to underscore the experts ' perception that the junta 's demeanor and stance has not been altered by the sanctions regime .
last month , an american citizen and human rights activist was sentenced to five years in prison for forging an identity card .
shortly thereafter , four other human rights activists were sentenced to prison terms on the day of the arrival of the un 's human rights envoy .
during his five day-trip , un envoy tomas ojea quintana was n't allowed to visit aung san suu kyi .
instead of sanctions , the eu should try to engage in a dialogue with the regime .
this dialogue policy should n't focus primarily on the junta leaders , but rather on mid-level government officials , says von hauff .
he has been travelling to burma regularly since 2001 to hold seminars and made an important observation : " it was really interesting that most of the people from the ministries were very open .
we could discuss all the problems and also the human rights situation .
so we should have a differentiated picture of the country . "
push from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : childen suffer especially from the dismal economic situation in burma but in order to engage the government effectively , the eu must first drop its current failed sanctions policy , argue von hauff and swanström .
only than can it regain any possible leverage on the junta , which it lost through the sanctions .
whether and when that could happen neither of the experts venture to say .
the push to change the eu 's policy toward burma could come once again from the us .
washington has recently sent some signals that it is rethinking its sanctions regime . should washington decide to change its policy , the eu would probably do so as well , says von hauff .

delegates from across china meet once a year to vote on proposed legislation .
and this year a few politicians in particular are in the spotlight . tian 'anmen square , located in the cbd of beijing , is now under tight security .
where tourists from all over the world usually take pictures , there are now police and soldiers .
they are there to keep peace and order for the 3,000 delegates who meet annually to discuss legislation .
skyrocketing real-estate prices , rampant corruption and disparities between the rich and the poor .
political scientist , gu xuewu from bonn university , believes this year , the national people 's congress will focus on domestic affairs .
experts say reorganizing the economy is at the top of the list .
one of beijing 's long term goals is to increase domestic demand and reduce exports .
gu xuewu does not expect anything world-shaking to come out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national people 's congress in beijings great hall of the people of the meeting .
" heads of the party will use the national people 's congress to test the reaction and the atmosphere among the people .
big decisions wo n't be made until after the meeting , when the politbureau meets again . "
the national people 's congress formally represents the voice of the chinese people and it is china 's highest legislative organ .
but the so-called " army of voters " only gives its approval to suggestions made by the party .
it is quite normal to have delegates vote 90 percent in favor on any random topic .
controversial discussions are very rare .
there was one in 1992 , when one third of the delegates voted against the construction of the three gorges dam project .
the npc has no say according to gu , when it comes to political decision making , the national people 's congress has no say : " when it comes to politics , to setting guidelines , political decisions are not made by the congress , but by the politbureau .
it is the party in china that retains the real power . "
what goes on behind the red velvet curtain in the great hall of the people , involves making private pacts and weaving webs of intrigues .
in two years there will be a generation change in party command .
cheng li of the brookings institute in washington says many are likely to be using the congress ' spotlight to spread their names throughout china . li thinks this goes especially for one man : party secretary of the city chongqing , bo xilai .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bo xilai is one of the leaders in spotlight " he is a self-made man , media-friendly and this is just one further event for him .
he already belongs to the 25-member politbureau .
he could very well become a member of the politbureau standing committee in two year 's time . "
the star of chinese politics bo xilai is the new star of the chinese politbureau .
born to a veteran of the revolution , he became known throughout china for cracking down on criminal gangs in chongqing .
the party newspaper named him man of the year .
bo xilai has held many party and government offices .
ex-party leader , jiang zemin , is one of his supporters .
but bo xilai is a controvercial figure .
some party members do n't agree with his take-no-gruff style .
but the people love him , it would seem .
bo 's rival in the fight for a seat in the politbureau standing committee is wang yang .
yang is the head of government in the rich guandong province .
he was a member of the communist youth league and is said to be president hu jintao 's protégé .
wang was bo xilai 's predecessor as party secretary of chongqing .
many believe bo xilai 's clampdown against organized crime was born out of spite for his predecessor .
but who will win in this power struggle has yet to be seen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 04.03.2010 flat outing shows loew and germany have much to do großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coaching staff have plenty to think about after being outclassed by argentina , it 's clear the german national team have weaknesses in all phases of their game .
dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

these would be " the most nationally-focused local elections ever , " the leftist volkskrant newspaper said as pollsters predicted a tough ride for the two biggest parties - the christian democratic appeal -lrb- cda -rrb- and the labor party -lrb- pvda -rrb- .

the pvv contested only two cities in its first municipal election , three months ahead of early general elections on june 9 .
the pvv holds nine seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament .
" we 're going to take the netherlands back from the leftist elite that coddles criminals and supports islamization , " freedom party leader geert wilders said early thursday .
wilders ' party came in second in the european elections of june last year , with 16.7 percent of the vote , behind the christian democrats of outgoing premier jan peter balkenende .
according to the results from 96 of the 98 polling stations , the pvv finished substantially ahead of the pvda in almere , with 21.6 percent of the vote .
the pvda , winners of the previous elections in 2006 , got 17.6 percent .

capitalizing on broken coalition pvda leader wouter bos withdrew his party from the national government last month in a spat with balkenende 's cda over extending the dutch military mission in afghanistan .
the cda won 41 seats out of 150 in parliament in the previous round of national elections , the pvda 33 and the pvv nine .
wilders is awaiting trial for alleged hate speech against muslims for having likened the koran to hitler 's " mein kampf " and calling islam a fascist religion .
in 2006 municipal elections , the pvda came out on top with 23.45 percent of the vote nationally , ahead of the cda which got 16.83 percent .

these would be " the most nationally-focused local elections ever , " the leftist volkskrant newspaper said as pollsters predicted a tough ride for the two biggest parties - the christian democratic appeal -lrb- cda -rrb- and the labor party -lrb- pvda -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende 's cabinet collapsed in february rising tide the toughest challenge came from geert wilders ' far-right party for freedom -lrb- pvv -rrb- party , set up in 2006 to " stop the islamization of the netherlands . "
the pvv contested only two cities in its first municipal election , three months ahead of early general elections on june 9 .
the pvv holds nine seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament .
" we 're going to take the netherlands back from the leftist elite that coddles criminals and supports islamization , " freedom party leader geert wilders said early thursday .
wilders ' party came in second in the european elections of june last year , with 16.7 percent of the vote , behind the christian democrats of outgoing premier jan peter balkenende .
according to the results from 96 of the 98 polling stations , the pvv finished substantially ahead of the pvda in almere , with 21.6 percent of the vote .
the pvda , winners of the previous elections in 2006 , got 17.6 percent .
" what is possible in the hague and almere is possible all over the country .
it 's a springboard for our victory , " wilders told his supporters in almere .
gains in the heart of holland in the hague , the country 's political capital , the pvv came in second behind the pvda , though complete results were not yet available .
most polls had predicted the pvv would come in first in almere , a city of 187,000 inhabitants east of the capital amsterdam , and second or third in the hague - the netherlands ' third largest city with 442,000 residents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister wouter bos withdrew his party from the coalition the results indicated that both the centrist parties were struggling ahead of national elections brought forward to june 9 ; the big winner being wilders ' pvv , now thought to be the country 's most popular political party .
some 12 million dutch out of a total 16.5 million were registered to vote in 394 municipalities for nearly 9,000 councillors countrywide .
capitalizing on broken coalition pvda leader wouter bos withdrew his party from the national government last month in a spat with balkenende 's cda over extending the dutch military mission in afghanistan .
the cda won 41 seats out of 150 in parliament in the previous round of national elections , the pvda 33 and the pvv nine .
wilders is awaiting trial for alleged hate speech against muslims for having likened the koran to hitler 's " mein kampf " and calling islam a fascist religion .
in 2006 municipal elections , the pvda came out on top with 23.45 percent of the vote nationally , ahead of the cda which got 16.83 percent .
final results of this year 's municipal elections will be released on friday. bk / ape / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

how are experts in asia reacting to this possible shift in us nuclear policy ? it has been nearly a year since us president barack obama unveiled his vision for a nuclear free world .
in a speech in the czech capital prague last april , he claimed america was committed ' to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons ' .
now his vision seems to be taking shape .
the new us nuclear policy review is expected to be announced in the next few weeks .
and as media reports suggest , the obama administration is likely to reduce its nuclear stockpile drastically and boost its conventional weapons capabilities .
the move will attract a lot of attention in asia , says commodore uday bhaskar , a security analyst in india .
" my sense is that the countries like india are looking at it with a lot of interest because these are objectives that india has been supporting and espousing for many decades and there has not been any serious international effort towards this end for many years . "
role of bigger nuclear powers despite india 's traditional stand on nuclear disarmament , it conducted nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998 and declared that it possessed nuclear capability .
its neighbor pakistan acquired nuclear weapons as well , stressing it needed them for defense against neighbors particularly india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a site of india ’ s nuclear test in 1998 neither country has signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty and experts doubt if they will ever give up their nuclear weapons as long as their relations remain strained .
moreover there is a school of thought that believes that the initiative to eliminate nuclear weapons should come from bigger nuclear powers .
" there are some 23,000 weapons all over the world .
out of this 22,000 are shared between us and russia , " says retired gen. talat masood , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the remaining one thousand are with other countries .
so i do n't think anyone should expect any change among other nuclear powers .
the lead has to come from us , russia , and then followed by other permanent un members and india , pakistan and israel . "
china 's dilemma china , on the other hand , has long maintained that it opposes nuclear proliferation and that its nuclear strategy is purely for self defense .
but its substantial increases in military budgets in recent years have sent signals that it wants to surpass the us as the world 's top military power .
oliver thränert , an expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , explains : " china thinks that the overwhelming superiority of the us in terms of its conventional weaponry means that a world without nuclear weapons would be a world in which the dominance of the us would be even clearer than now .

the hatoyama government is seeking to denuclearize northeast asia as one of its top priorities , says key-young son an expert on international affairs in japan .
he says any signs from the us towards denuclearization will also give a fresh push to the six party talks on north korea 's nuclear program that have remain stalled for the last few years and which aim at paving the way for a nuclear free korean peninsula : " one of the reasons why north korea is hesitating to take steps forward is that the north korean government does n't believe in any intentions of the obama administration , " says key-young son .
" if the obama administration is moving to build trust in terms of nuclear issues , i think it will obviously help in the restart of nuclear talks and also it might change the attitude of north korea in a more positive direction in the near future . "
during his prague speech , obama admitted that the goal of a nuclear free world would not be reached quickly .
experts say lessons could be learned from the earlier disarmament efforts such as the chemical weapons convention which came into force in 1997 after many long years of negotiation .

how are experts in asia reacting to this possible shift in us nuclear policy ? it has been nearly a year since us president barack obama unveiled his vision for a nuclear free world .
in a speech in the czech capital prague last april , he claimed america was committed ' to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons ' .
now his vision seems to be taking shape .
the new us nuclear policy review is expected to be announced in the next few weeks .
and as media reports suggest , the obama administration is likely to reduce its nuclear stockpile drastically and boost its conventional weapons capabilities .
the move will attract a lot of attention in asia , says commodore uday bhaskar , a security analyst in india .
" my sense is that the countries like india are looking at it with a lot of interest because these are objectives that india has been supporting and espousing for many decades and there has not been any serious international effort towards this end for many years . "
role of bigger nuclear powers despite india 's traditional stand on nuclear disarmament , it conducted nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998 and declared that it possessed nuclear capability .
its neighbor pakistan acquired nuclear weapons as well , stressing it needed them for defense against neighbors particularly india .

moreover there is a school of thought that believes that the initiative to eliminate nuclear weapons should come from bigger nuclear powers .
" there are some 23,000 weapons all over the world .
out of this 22,000 are shared between us and russia , " says retired gen. talat masood , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the remaining one thousand are with other countries .
so i do n't think anyone should expect any change among other nuclear powers .
the lead has to come from us , russia , and then followed by other permanent un members and india , pakistan and israel . "
china 's dilemma china , on the other hand , has long maintained that it opposes nuclear proliferation and that its nuclear strategy is purely for self defense .
but its substantial increases in military budgets in recent years have sent signals that it wants to surpass the us as the world 's top military power .
oliver thränert , an expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , explains : " china thinks that the overwhelming superiority of the us in terms of its conventional weaponry means that a world without nuclear weapons would be a world in which the dominance of the us would be even clearer than now . "

the hatoyama government is seeking to denuclearize northeast asia as one of its top priorities , says key-young son an expert on international affairs in japan .
he says any signs from the us towards denuclearization will also give a fresh push to the six party talks on north korea 's nuclear program that have remain stalled for the last few years and which aim at paving the way for a nuclear free korean peninsula : " one of the reasons why north korea is hesitating to take steps forward is that the north korean government does n't believe in any intentions of the obama administration , " says key-young son .
" if the obama administration is moving to build trust in terms of nuclear issues , i think it will obviously help in the restart of nuclear talks and also it might change the attitude of north korea in a more positive direction in the near future . "
during his prague speech , obama admitted that the goal of a nuclear free world would not be reached quickly .
experts say lessons could be learned from the earlier disarmament efforts such as the chemical weapons convention which came into force in 1997 after many long years of negotiation .

nominees include lady gaga , david guetta , and the black eyed peas as well as german bands silbermond and ich + ich . as the german equivalent of the grammys or the brit pop awards , the echo awards differ from their anglophile counterparts in one critical way : the echos give nearly equal focus to german and international artists . nominations are divided into ' domestic ' and ' international ' categories .

but the tickets for the 2010 echos awards , which will be held at a smaller venue with space for about 4,000 guests , were still a hot commodity .

the hungarian-born is recognized with this year 's chamisso prize for non-native german authors . it is a freezing cold afternoon in berlin .
outside , people are trudging through the snow with shopping bags ; others are hurrying to crowded trams .
terezia mora is taking refuge in a small courtyard movie theater .
the window panes are fogged up and the interior is glaringly empty . to lose herself in a film , to have the whole screen for herself while everyone else is working , to disappear in a hectic rush - for terezia mora , this is a pleasant distraction from writing .
and it reminds her of the 1990s , when she left hungary at the age of 19 to study in germany . " i went to the movies almost seven times a week because that 's what i had missed the most in my little home village , " explained mora .
" here in berlin i could really feel free . "
bleak no-man 's land terezia mora was born in hungary and her family belonged to the country 's german minority .
for her , being in berlin shortly after the fall of the berlin wall was a form of liberation - away from a strict communist society , submerged in an unfinished city open to experiments .
she began to study screenwriting - probably a reason why many of her later stories have a cinematic verve to them and contain precise dialogue . she wrote her first literary text in german and gave a reading at a public event , more out of curiosity than anything else .
soon after that she received a contract with a renowned publishing company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the only man on the continent " wants to escape his reality she named her book of short stories " seltsame materie " -lrb- " strange material " -rrb- - a collection of raw , somber tales from her own childhood .
they are stories from a no-man 's land , somewhere between hungary and austria . " maybe if i had stayed there , i would have never become a writer , " said mora . for mora , german is the language of her own books - hungarian is the language of others .
her other job is translating hungarian literature into german .
for her , writing has something to do with time , the ordering of memories and the relaxing of the mind . this is a slow process , which is why mora only publishes one book every five years .
often she writes from the perspective of strange male characters . " if i were to write about women , i would reveal more about myself than i want to , " said the author . lost in the net a recurring theme in mora 's books is communication - people who are linguistically uprooted and can not find emotional stability .
in her debut novel " day in day out " she tells the story of a balkan refugee in western europe , a brilliant man who speaks 10 languages but somehow can not make himself understood in any of them . her last novel " the only man on the continent " describes a week in the life of an overweight computer nerd , darius kopp .
he works for an international company , but then the collapsing global economy affects his job , leaving him insecure and depressed - a man with no control over his feelings or his finances . through his character , mora wanted to depict " someone who flees to this artificial internet world , " which is " both tragic and comical . " outside the box bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mora achieves self-expression in german mora can walk the literary tightrope like few others can .
she can alter moods and perspectives virtuously and suddenly ; passionate inner monologues collide with sober comments , flowing out of detailed observations .
she dissects the german language , exploiting its potential to the full . despite her talent , mora was labeled a foreigner at first , a common experience for authors with an immigrant background . " that irritated me for a long while , " said mora .
" now , authors like me are so present that people just have to get used to us . " mora 's books are praised by critics and distinguished with awards like the ingeborg bachmann prize and now the chamisso prize , which is awarded annually by the robert bosch foundation to non-germans who publish literary works in the german language .
despite this , she can deal well with people 's high expectations of her . " i know that all of things can not change the substance of who i am , " said mora confidently . nevertheless , the money that comes from awards - including 15,000 euros -lrb- $ 20,300 -rrb- from the chamisso prize - is important to her , since with the distinction alone she " ca n't buy any flower pots " for herself , she said . after all , mora lives from her writing .
she has her feet firmly on the ground , both as an author and as the mother of a young daughter .
she does not fit the cliche of the dreamy writer distanced from the world around them .
for her , writing means taking a close look when certainties evaporate and borderlines disintegrate . author : aygul cizmecioglu -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .

a first-half strike by gonzalo higuain was enough to secure a 1-0 victory over jogi loew 's hapless men . gonzalo higuain clipped a neat goal over the onrushing german goalkeeper rene adler to give diego maradona 's argentina an away win to a lackluster germany in munich 's allianz stadium .
germany was arguably maradona 's biggest scalp so far in his short career as argentina 's national coach , and the world cup legend made clear afterwards how seriously he had taken the challenge .
" we needed to show ourselves we could do what we did today , " maradona said in the post-match press conference .
" we wanted to show against a good team that we are alive and we understand the moment of the argentine national team , which has not won the world cup for 24 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona claimed his first high-profile scalp in munich reporters could not help but be reminded of the two famous world cup finals , both featuring maradona , germany and argentina fought out in 1986 and 1990 .
adler 's howler the goal that decided wednesday 's friendly came after rene adler 's ill-advised decision to come out for a long ball knocked hopefully into the german half .
real madrid striker higuain , often overlooked by maradona and his predecessor alfio basile , beat adler to the ball by what the keeper later ruefully described as " that famous half-meter " and slotted home the finish .
throughout the rest of an edgy , tactical game , the german defence often resorted to rough-arm tactics to stop argentina 's star attackers lionel messi and angel di maria , though there was nothing they could do to stop a brilliant effort by the benfica player .
collecting veron 's pass about 25 metres from goal , di maria slipped his marker , thumped his shot against the crossbar and appeared to be smacked in the face by a defender immediately afterwards .
argentina dominate veron tried an even more spectacular effort early in the second half when adler failed to clear the ball properly and the estudiantes player lobbed the goalkeeper from about 40 meters only to see his effort just miss the target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friendly was one of the last warm-up games before the world cup germany came to life after cacau replaced the ineffective mesut oezil in the 67th minute , but while the brazilian-born forward tested argentinian keeper sergio romero with a powerful drive , he could do nothing to avert germany 's defeat , which marked the third game without a win for jogi loew 's men .
the frustrated german crowd watched most of the world cup warm-up match in silence , while argentinian supporters cheered as the south american powerhouses stroked the ball around in the dying minutes and greeted the final whistle with a resounding chorus of jeers .
" our mistake was not to take more risks up front , " concluded germany captain michael ballack after the game . according to fifa 's latest world rankings , germany is number five - four places above argentina at nine , one behind england .

how are experts in asia reacting to this possible shift in us nuclear policy ? it has been nearly a year since us president barack obama unveiled his vision for a nuclear free world .
in a speech in the czech capital prague last april , he claimed america was committed ' to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons ' .
now his vision seems to be taking shape .
the new us nuclear policy review is expected to be announced in the next few weeks .
and as media reports suggest , the obama administration is likely to reduce its nuclear stockpile drastically and boost its conventional weapons capabilities .
the move will attract a lot of attention in asia , says commodore uday bhaskar , a security analyst in india .
" my sense is that the countries like india are looking at it with a lot of interest because these are objectives that india has been supporting and espousing for many decades and there has not been any serious international effort towards this end for many years . "
role of bigger nuclear powers despite india 's traditional stand on nuclear disarmament , it conducted nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998 and declared that it possessed nuclear capability .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a site of india ’ s nuclear test in 1998 neither country has signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty and experts doubt if they will ever give up their nuclear weapons as long as their relations remain strained .
moreover there is a school of thought that believes that the initiative to eliminate nuclear weapons should come from bigger nuclear powers .
" there are some 23,000 weapons all over the world .
out of this 22,000 are shared between us and russia , " says retired gen. talat masood , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the remaining one thousand are with other countries .

china 's dilemma china , on the other hand , has long maintained that it opposes nuclear proliferation and that its nuclear strategy is purely for self defense .
but its substantial increases in military budgets in recent years have sent signals that it wants to surpass the us as the world 's top military power .
oliver thränert , an expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , explains : " china thinks that the overwhelming superiority of the us in terms of its conventional weaponry means that a world without nuclear weapons would be a world in which the dominance of the us would be even clearer than now .

he says any signs from the us towards denuclearization will also give a fresh push to the six party talks on north korea 's nuclear program that have remain stalled for the last few years and which aim at paving the way for a nuclear free korean peninsula : " one of the reasons why north korea is hesitating to take steps forward is that the north korean government does n't believe in any intentions of the obama administration , " says key-young son .
" if the obama administration is moving to build trust in terms of nuclear issues , i think it will obviously help in the restart of nuclear talks and also it might change the attitude of north korea in a more positive direction in the near future . "
during his prague speech , obama admitted that the goal of a nuclear free world would not be reached quickly .
experts say lessons could be learned from the earlier disarmament efforts such as the chemical weapons convention which came into force in 1997 after many long years of negotiation .

how are experts in asia reacting to this possible shift in us nuclear policy ? it has been nearly a year since us president barack obama unveiled his vision for a nuclear free world .
in a speech in the czech capital prague last april , he claimed america was committed ' to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons ' .
now his vision seems to be taking shape .
the new us nuclear policy review is expected to be announced in the next few weeks .
and as media reports suggest , the obama administration is likely to reduce its nuclear stockpile drastically and boost its conventional weapons capabilities .
the move will attract a lot of attention in asia , says commodore uday bhaskar , a security analyst in india .
" my sense is that the countries like india are looking at it with a lot of interest because these are objectives that india has been supporting and espousing for many decades and there has not been any serious international effort towards this end for many years . "
role of bigger nuclear powers despite india 's traditional stand on nuclear disarmament , it conducted nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998 and declared that it possessed nuclear capability .
its neighbor pakistan acquired nuclear weapons as well , stressing it needed them for defense against neighbors particularly india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a site of india ’ s nuclear test in 1998 neither country has signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty and experts doubt if they will ever give up their nuclear weapons as long as their relations remain strained .
moreover there is a school of thought that believes that the initiative to eliminate nuclear weapons should come from bigger nuclear powers .
" there are some 23,000 weapons all over the world .
out of this 22,000 are shared between us and russia , " says retired gen. talat masood , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the remaining one thousand are with other countries .
so i do n't think anyone should expect any change among other nuclear powers .
the lead has to come from us , russia , and then followed by other permanent un members and india , pakistan and israel . "
china 's dilemma china , on the other hand , has long maintained that it opposes nuclear proliferation and that its nuclear strategy is purely for self defense .
but its substantial increases in military budgets in recent years have sent signals that it wants to surpass the us as the world 's top military power .
oliver thränert , an expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , explains : " china thinks that the overwhelming superiority of the us in terms of its conventional weaponry means that a world without nuclear weapons would be a world in which the dominance of the us would be even clearer than now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea ’ s nuclear facilities at yongbyon north korea nuclear issue the idea of global nuclear disarmament has got considerable support in the northeast asia though , particularly in japan , the only country to have suffered nuclear bombardment .
the hatoyama government is seeking to denuclearize northeast asia as one of its top priorities , says key-young son an expert on international affairs in japan .
he says any signs from the us towards denuclearization will also give a fresh push to the six party talks on north korea 's nuclear program that have remain stalled for the last few years and which aim at paving the way for a nuclear free korean peninsula : " one of the reasons why north korea is hesitating to take steps forward is that the north korean government does n't believe in any intentions of the obama administration , " says key-young son .
" if the obama administration is moving to build trust in terms of nuclear issues , i think it will obviously help in the restart of nuclear talks and also it might change the attitude of north korea in a more positive direction in the near future . "
during his prague speech , obama admitted that the goal of a nuclear free world would not be reached quickly .
experts say lessons could be learned from the earlier disarmament efforts such as the chemical weapons convention which came into force in 1997 after many long years of negotiation .

a first-half strike by gonzalo higuain was enough to secure a 1-0 victory over jogi loew 's hapless men . gonzalo higuain clipped a neat goal over the onrushing german goalkeeper rene adler to give diego maradona 's argentina an away win to a lackluster germany in munich 's allianz stadium .
germany was arguably maradona 's biggest scalp so far in his short career as argentina 's national coach , and the world cup legend made clear afterwards how seriously he had taken the challenge .
" we needed to show ourselves we could do what we did today , " maradona said in the post-match press conference .
" we wanted to show against a good team that we are alive and we understand the moment of the argentine national team , which has not won the world cup for 24 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona claimed his first high-profile scalp in munich reporters could not help but be reminded of the two famous world cup finals , both featuring maradona , germany and argentina fought out in 1986 and 1990 .
adler 's howler the goal that decided wednesday 's friendly came after rene adler 's ill-advised decision to come out for a long ball knocked hopefully into the german half .
real madrid striker higuain , often overlooked by maradona and his predecessor alfio basile , beat adler to the ball by what the keeper later ruefully described as " that famous half-meter " and slotted home the finish .
throughout the rest of an edgy , tactical game , the german defence often resorted to rough-arm tactics to stop argentina 's star attackers lionel messi and angel di maria , though there was nothing they could do to stop a brilliant effort by the benfica player .
collecting veron 's pass about 25 metres from goal , di maria slipped his marker , thumped his shot against the crossbar and appeared to be smacked in the face by a defender immediately afterwards .
argentina dominate veron tried an even more spectacular effort early in the second half when adler failed to clear the ball properly and the estudiantes player lobbed the goalkeeper from about 40 meters only to see his effort just miss the target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friendly was one of the last warm-up games before the world cup germany came to life after cacau replaced the ineffective mesut oezil in the 67th minute , but while the brazilian-born forward tested argentinian keeper sergio romero with a powerful drive , he could do nothing to avert germany 's defeat , which marked the third game without a win for jogi loew 's men .
the frustrated german crowd watched most of the world cup warm-up match in silence , while argentinian supporters cheered as the south american powerhouses stroked the ball around in the dying minutes and greeted the final whistle with a resounding chorus of jeers .
" our mistake was not to take more risks up front , " concluded germany captain michael ballack after the game . according to fifa 's latest world rankings , germany is number five - four places above argentina at nine , one behind england .

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 04.03.2010 germany falls to maradona 's argentinians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene adler arrived too late to prevent the game 's only goal germany 's national soccer team suffered a disappointing defeat to argentina on wednesday evening .
a first-half strike by gonzalo higuain was enough to secure a 1-0 victory over jogi loew 's hapless men . gonzalo higuain clipped a neat goal over the onrushing german goalkeeper rene adler to give diego maradona 's argentina an away win to a lackluster germany in munich 's allianz stadium .
germany was arguably maradona 's biggest scalp so far in his short career as argentina 's national coach , and the world cup legend made clear afterwards how seriously he had taken the challenge .
" we needed to show ourselves we could do what we did today , " maradona said in the post-match press conference .
" we wanted to show against a good team that we are alive and we understand the moment of the argentine national team , which has not won the world cup for 24 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona claimed his first high-profile scalp in munich reporters could not help but be reminded of the two famous world cup finals , both featuring maradona , germany and argentina fought out in 1986 and 1990 .
adler 's howler the goal that decided wednesday 's friendly came after rene adler 's ill-advised decision to come out for a long ball knocked hopefully into the german half .
real madrid striker higuain , often overlooked by maradona and his predecessor alfio basile , beat adler to the ball by what the keeper later ruefully described as " that famous half-meter " and slotted home the finish .
throughout the rest of an edgy , tactical game , the german defence often resorted to rough-arm tactics to stop argentina 's star attackers lionel messi and angel di maria , though there was nothing they could do to stop a brilliant effort by the benfica player .
collecting veron 's pass about 25 metres from goal , di maria slipped his marker , thumped his shot against the crossbar and appeared to be smacked in the face by a defender immediately afterwards .
argentina dominate veron tried an even more spectacular effort early in the second half when adler failed to clear the ball properly and the estudiantes player lobbed the goalkeeper from about 40 meters only to see his effort just miss the target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friendly was one of the last warm-up games before the world cup germany came to life after cacau replaced the ineffective mesut oezil in the 67th minute , but while the brazilian-born forward tested argentinian keeper sergio romero with a powerful drive , he could do nothing to avert germany 's defeat , which marked the third game without a win for jogi loew 's men .
the frustrated german crowd watched most of the world cup warm-up match in silence , while argentinian supporters cheered as the south american powerhouses stroked the ball around in the dying minutes and greeted the final whistle with a resounding chorus of jeers .
" our mistake was not to take more risks up front , " concluded germany captain michael ballack after the game . according to fifa 's latest world rankings , germany is number five - four places above argentina at nine , one behind england .

dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .

wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

a first-half strike by gonzalo higuain was enough to secure a 1-0 victory over jogi loew 's hapless men . gonzalo higuain clipped a neat goal over the onrushing german goalkeeper rene adler to give diego maradona 's argentina an away win to a lackluster germany in munich 's allianz stadium .
germany was arguably maradona 's biggest scalp so far in his short career as argentina 's national coach , and the world cup legend made clear afterwards how seriously he had taken the challenge .
" we needed to show ourselves we could do what we did today , " maradona said in the post-match press conference .
" we wanted to show against a good team that we are alive and we understand the moment of the argentine national team , which has not won the world cup for 24 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona claimed his first high-profile scalp in munich reporters could not help but be reminded of the two famous world cup finals , both featuring maradona , germany and argentina fought out in 1986 and 1990 .
adler 's howler the goal that decided wednesday 's friendly came after rene adler 's ill-advised decision to come out for a long ball knocked hopefully into the german half .
real madrid striker higuain , often overlooked by maradona and his predecessor alfio basile , beat adler to the ball by what the keeper later ruefully described as " that famous half-meter " and slotted home the finish .
throughout the rest of an edgy , tactical game , the german defence often resorted to rough-arm tactics to stop argentina 's star attackers lionel messi and angel di maria , though there was nothing they could do to stop a brilliant effort by the benfica player .
collecting veron 's pass about 25 metres from goal , di maria slipped his marker , thumped his shot against the crossbar and appeared to be smacked in the face by a defender immediately afterwards .
argentina dominate veron tried an even more spectacular effort early in the second half when adler failed to clear the ball properly and the estudiantes player lobbed the goalkeeper from about 40 meters only to see his effort just miss the target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friendly was one of the last warm-up games before the world cup germany came to life after cacau replaced the ineffective mesut oezil in the 67th minute , but while the brazilian-born forward tested argentinian keeper sergio romero with a powerful drive , he could do nothing to avert germany 's defeat , which marked the third game without a win for jogi loew 's men .
the frustrated german crowd watched most of the world cup warm-up match in silence , while argentinian supporters cheered as the south american powerhouses stroked the ball around in the dying minutes and greeted the final whistle with a resounding chorus of jeers .
" our mistake was not to take more risks up front , " concluded germany captain michael ballack after the game . according to fifa 's latest world rankings , germany is number five - four places above argentina at nine , one behind england .

as brussels painstakingly deliberates the merits of aspiring european union members in the balkans , beijing has begun an investment offensive in the region .
but is china ’ s money talking economics or politics ? last year , presidents hu jintao of china and boris tadic of serbia cemented their bilateral relations and traditional friendship with a strategic partnership .
besides reaffirming their mutual respect for one another 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , pledging broader , stronger and deeper ties , the two republics firmly stated their aim to promote economic cooperation and trade .
a document resulting from their partnership agreement said the two sides had expressed a readiness to “ ensure continuous and steady growth of bilateral trade and gradually improve the balance of bilateral trade through development in accordance with the principle of equality , mutual benefit , reciprocity and win-win result . ”
a few months down the line the export import bank of china -lrb- china eximbank -rrb- has granted belgrade a billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- loan to upgrade two power plants and build a much-needed bridge over the beautiful blue danube .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bridge would help unclog belgrade 's traffic the bridge project , which is due to get underway in the spring , is critical both as a means of easing the traffic situation in belgrade , and as a test of how well china can work with its south-eastern european partner .
an official from the cabinet of serbia 's national investment plan -lrb- nip -rrb- , who preferred not to be named , told deutsche welle that continued chinese presence in the region hinges on the success of the bridge scheme . " there are a lot of projects we would like the chinese to do , " he said .
" but they want to see how it turns out first . "
what 's good for one … and serbia is not the only country in the balkans which embraces the idea of a free-flowing yuan .
dusan reljic from the eu external relations division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that chinese presence is gathering momentum right across the region .
" the chinese are in slovenia , in macedonia , they 're exporting buses to skopje , they 're talking to croatia about transport facilities , harbors , airports , railway connections , " he said " and they 've been talking to the greeks about leasing possibilities in athens harbor . "
analysts have described china 's arrival in the balkans as an effort to get into europe through the back door .
but kerry brown of the asia program at london 's chatham house , disputes the need for sneaking in through the rear when the " front door is wide open . "
citing telecommunications and automotive high-tech retail industries as examples , he told deutsche welle that chinese investors are already in europe .
win-win result ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pireus harbor in athens dusan reljic agrees , but says taking the direct route to greater eu presence would be more costly for china than investing in territories poised to join within the next 10 to 15 years .
" it 's cheaper to buy assets there -lsb- southern-eastern europe -rsb- than within the present european union , " the expert said .
a cheap ride for china , but what 's in it for the conduit countries like serbia ?
" a good deal , " says reljic .
with very little direct foreign investment coming into the region , tight government budgets and unemployment rates on the rise again , he says balkan states need and welcome china 's money , which comes with grace periods , generously low interest rates and very few strings attached .
" the chinese do not attach economic or political conditions to their loans , " reljic said .
" in a way , cheap chinese money is an alternative to commercially expensive western money or politically expensive money from the international monetary fund or the world bank . "
the politics of economics but money is not the only factor at play .
reljic says beijing 's activities in the balkans are as much about political positioning as they are about financial returns .
" this increased presence is also a signal to the us and the west that china is no longer a peripheral world power , but it is the world power and it is engaging in all political developments throughout the world with its own agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kosovo is serbia " graffiti is testimony to kosovo 's disputed independence an example of that agenda is beijing 's vehement opposition to kosovo 's independence .
china recently spoke out against kosovo 's split from serbia at the international court of justice in the hague .
yet many analysts would say such public displays of support have less to do with china 's concern over stability in the balkans region than with a concern that its own minority groups might follow kosovo 's lead towards independence .
and that , says kerry brown is " absolutely not what they want . "
weighing it up so what do they want ?
" china wants to remake the world and is disappointed that the world wo n't comply . "
brown said .
" it is guided by self-interest and is happy to abuse friendships . "
he says china , which has itself stated its national aim of becoming a strong and wealthy country , is often hard for foreign partners to understand , which is why smaller countries like those in the balkans should be aware of what they want from a partnership with beijing .
" if countries say yes to everything , they have the complication of becoming a tributary state of china . "
but the nip official told deutsche welle such problems would not arise between belgrade and beijing .
" according to domestic law , we are obliged to hire third-party supervision , " he said .
" the chinese will not be given free reign to do whatever they want , no matter who they are dealing with . "

terezia mora is taking refuge in a small courtyard movie theater .

xavier naidoo , beyonce , and depeche mode are among the nominees for the 2010 echo awards .
the prestigious prizes honoring the year 's best pop and rock music will be awarded in berlin on thursday . it 's the most anticipated evening in german pop music : the echo awards for rock and pop will be presented in berlin on thursday evening .
nominees include lady gaga , david guetta , and the black eyed peas as well as german bands silbermond and ich + ich . as the german equivalent of the grammys or the brit pop awards , the echo awards differ from their anglophile counterparts in one critical way : the echos give nearly equal focus to german and international artists . nominations are divided into ' domestic ' and ' international ' categories .
daniel knoell of the german music industry association told deutsche welle that the international focus of the awards is highlighted by the diverse performances lined up for thursday 's ceremony .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scorpions performed at last year 's echo awards .
" we have international stars like rihanna or robbie williams , who will perform in english , and we have artists like peter maffay , who will present his songs in german , " knoell said . in addition to the usual categories of " best artist " , and " best band , " the echo awards also feature nominations for the best german folk music and best german " schlager " singer . sold-out show this year 's echo event is noticeably smaller than last year 's , which boasted a record audience of 10,000 fans in the o2 arena in berlin .
but the tickets for the 2010 echos awards , which will be held at a smaller venue with space for about 4,000 guests , were still a hot commodity .
this year 's tickets sold out in seven minutes , according to organizers . founded in 1992 by the deutsche phono-akademie - the cultural institute of the association of the german music industry , the echo is one of the most important european music prizes . author : sarah harman editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

delegates from across china meet once a year to vote on proposed legislation .
and this year a few politicians in particular are in the spotlight . tian 'anmen square , located in the cbd of beijing , is now under tight security .

they are there to keep peace and order for the 3,000 delegates who meet annually to discuss legislation .
skyrocketing real-estate prices , rampant corruption and disparities between the rich and the poor .
political scientist , gu xuewu from bonn university , believes this year , the national people 's congress will focus on domestic affairs .
experts say reorganizing the economy is at the top of the list .
one of beijing 's long term goals is to increase domestic demand and reduce exports .
gu xuewu does not expect anything world-shaking to come out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national people 's congress in beijings great hall of the people of the meeting .
" heads of the party will use the national people 's congress to test the reaction and the atmosphere among the people .

but the so-called " army of voters " only gives its approval to suggestions made by the party .
it is quite normal to have delegates vote 90 percent in favor on any random topic .
controversial discussions are very rare .
there was one in 1992 , when one third of the delegates voted against the construction of the three gorges dam project .
the npc has no say according to gu , when it comes to political decision making , the national people 's congress has no say : " when it comes to politics , to setting guidelines , political decisions are not made by the congress , but by the politbureau .
it is the party in china that retains the real power . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bo xilai is one of the leaders in spotlight " he is a self-made man , media-friendly and this is just one further event for him .
he already belongs to the 25-member politbureau .
he could very well become a member of the politbureau standing committee in two year 's time . "
the star of chinese politics bo xilai is the new star of the chinese politbureau .
born to a veteran of the revolution , he became known throughout china for cracking down on criminal gangs in chongqing .
the party newspaper named him man of the year .
bo xilai has held many party and government offices .
ex-party leader , jiang zemin , is one of his supporters .
but bo xilai is a controvercial figure .
some party members do n't agree with his take-no-gruff style .
but the people love him , it would seem .
bo 's rival in the fight for a seat in the politbureau standing committee is wang yang .
yang is the head of government in the rich guandong province .
he was a member of the communist youth league and is said to be president hu jintao 's protégé .
wang was bo xilai 's predecessor as party secretary of chongqing .
many believe bo xilai 's clampdown against organized crime was born out of spite for his predecessor .
but who will win in this power struggle has yet to be seen .

delegates from across china meet once a year to vote on proposed legislation .
and this year a few politicians in particular are in the spotlight . tian 'anmen square , located in the cbd of beijing , is now under tight security .
where tourists from all over the world usually take pictures , there are now police and soldiers .
they are there to keep peace and order for the 3,000 delegates who meet annually to discuss legislation .
skyrocketing real-estate prices , rampant corruption and disparities between the rich and the poor .
political scientist , gu xuewu from bonn university , believes this year , the national people 's congress will focus on domestic affairs .
experts say reorganizing the economy is at the top of the list .
one of beijing 's long term goals is to increase domestic demand and reduce exports .
gu xuewu does not expect anything world-shaking to come out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national people 's congress in beijings great hall of the people of the meeting .
" heads of the party will use the national people 's congress to test the reaction and the atmosphere among the people .
big decisions wo n't be made until after the meeting , when the politbureau meets again . "
the national people 's congress formally represents the voice of the chinese people and it is china 's highest legislative organ .
but the so-called " army of voters " only gives its approval to suggestions made by the party .
it is quite normal to have delegates vote 90 percent in favor on any random topic .
controversial discussions are very rare .
there was one in 1992 , when one third of the delegates voted against the construction of the three gorges dam project .
the npc has no say according to gu , when it comes to political decision making , the national people 's congress has no say : " when it comes to politics , to setting guidelines , political decisions are not made by the congress , but by the politbureau .
it is the party in china that retains the real power . "
what goes on behind the red velvet curtain in the great hall of the people , involves making private pacts and weaving webs of intrigues .
in two years there will be a generation change in party command .
cheng li of the brookings institute in washington says many are likely to be using the congress ' spotlight to spread their names throughout china . li thinks this goes especially for one man : party secretary of the city chongqing , bo xilai .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bo xilai is one of the leaders in spotlight " he is a self-made man , media-friendly and this is just one further event for him .
he already belongs to the 25-member politbureau .
he could very well become a member of the politbureau standing committee in two year 's time . "
the star of chinese politics bo xilai is the new star of the chinese politbureau .
born to a veteran of the revolution , he became known throughout china for cracking down on criminal gangs in chongqing .
the party newspaper named him man of the year .
bo xilai has held many party and government offices .
ex-party leader , jiang zemin , is one of his supporters .
but bo xilai is a controvercial figure .
some party members do n't agree with his take-no-gruff style .
but the people love him , it would seem .
bo 's rival in the fight for a seat in the politbureau standing committee is wang yang .
yang is the head of government in the rich guandong province .
he was a member of the communist youth league and is said to be president hu jintao 's protégé .
wang was bo xilai 's predecessor as party secretary of chongqing .
many believe bo xilai 's clampdown against organized crime was born out of spite for his predecessor .
but who will win in this power struggle has yet to be seen .

how are experts in asia reacting to this possible shift in us nuclear policy ? it has been nearly a year since us president barack obama unveiled his vision for a nuclear free world .
in a speech in the czech capital prague last april , he claimed america was committed ' to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons ' .
now his vision seems to be taking shape .
the new us nuclear policy review is expected to be announced in the next few weeks .
and as media reports suggest , the obama administration is likely to reduce its nuclear stockpile drastically and boost its conventional weapons capabilities .
the move will attract a lot of attention in asia , says commodore uday bhaskar , a security analyst in india .
" my sense is that the countries like india are looking at it with a lot of interest because these are objectives that india has been supporting and espousing for many decades and there has not been any serious international effort towards this end for many years . "
role of bigger nuclear powers despite india 's traditional stand on nuclear disarmament , it conducted nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998 and declared that it possessed nuclear capability .
its neighbor pakistan acquired nuclear weapons as well , stressing it needed them for defense against neighbors particularly india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a site of india ’ s nuclear test in 1998 neither country has signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty and experts doubt if they will ever give up their nuclear weapons as long as their relations remain strained .
moreover there is a school of thought that believes that the initiative to eliminate nuclear weapons should come from bigger nuclear powers .
" there are some 23,000 weapons all over the world .
out of this 22,000 are shared between us and russia , " says retired gen. talat masood , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the remaining one thousand are with other countries .
so i do n't think anyone should expect any change among other nuclear powers .
the lead has to come from us , russia , and then followed by other permanent un members and india , pakistan and israel . "
china 's dilemma china , on the other hand , has long maintained that it opposes nuclear proliferation and that its nuclear strategy is purely for self defense .
but its substantial increases in military budgets in recent years have sent signals that it wants to surpass the us as the world 's top military power .
oliver thränert , an expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , explains : " china thinks that the overwhelming superiority of the us in terms of its conventional weaponry means that a world without nuclear weapons would be a world in which the dominance of the us would be even clearer than now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea ’ s nuclear facilities at yongbyon north korea nuclear issue the idea of global nuclear disarmament has got considerable support in the northeast asia though , particularly in japan , the only country to have suffered nuclear bombardment .
the hatoyama government is seeking to denuclearize northeast asia as one of its top priorities , says key-young son an expert on international affairs in japan .
he says any signs from the us towards denuclearization will also give a fresh push to the six party talks on north korea 's nuclear program that have remain stalled for the last few years and which aim at paving the way for a nuclear free korean peninsula : " one of the reasons why north korea is hesitating to take steps forward is that the north korean government does n't believe in any intentions of the obama administration , " says key-young son .
" if the obama administration is moving to build trust in terms of nuclear issues , i think it will obviously help in the restart of nuclear talks and also it might change the attitude of north korea in a more positive direction in the near future . "
during his prague speech , obama admitted that the goal of a nuclear free world would not be reached quickly .
experts say lessons could be learned from the earlier disarmament efforts such as the chemical weapons convention which came into force in 1997 after many long years of negotiation .

how are experts in asia reacting to this possible shift in us nuclear policy ? it has been nearly a year since us president barack obama unveiled his vision for a nuclear free world .
in a speech in the czech capital prague last april , he claimed america was committed ' to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons ' .
now his vision seems to be taking shape .
the new us nuclear policy review is expected to be announced in the next few weeks .
and as media reports suggest , the obama administration is likely to reduce its nuclear stockpile drastically and boost its conventional weapons capabilities .
the move will attract a lot of attention in asia , says commodore uday bhaskar , a security analyst in india .
" my sense is that the countries like india are looking at it with a lot of interest because these are objectives that india has been supporting and espousing for many decades and there has not been any serious international effort towards this end for many years . "
role of bigger nuclear powers despite india 's traditional stand on nuclear disarmament , it conducted nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998 and declared that it possessed nuclear capability .
its neighbor pakistan acquired nuclear weapons as well , stressing it needed them for defense against neighbors particularly india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a site of india ’ s nuclear test in 1998 neither country has signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty and experts doubt if they will ever give up their nuclear weapons as long as their relations remain strained .
moreover there is a school of thought that believes that the initiative to eliminate nuclear weapons should come from bigger nuclear powers .
" there are some 23,000 weapons all over the world .
out of this 22,000 are shared between us and russia , " says retired gen. talat masood , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the remaining one thousand are with other countries .
so i do n't think anyone should expect any change among other nuclear powers .

the pkk , or kurdistan workers ' party , is considered by the european union , united states and turkey to be a terrorist organization . over 300 police raided 25 sites all across belgium , the german news agency dpa reported , citing belgian news reports .
police also raided the offices in denderleeuw of roj tv , an international kurdish broadcaster that backs the pkk .
firat , a news agency with links to the pkk , reported that the people arrested included two former turkish parliament members involved in the party 's operations in europe , remzi kartal and zubeyir aydar .
since october 2009 aydar has been on a us list of drug traffickers suspected of using smuggling proceeds to fund the pkk .
turkey applauds arrests turkish foreign minister ahmet davutoglu told reporters that the raids showed belgian authorities ' " determination and sense of responsibility . "
" this action by belgium , following -lrb- similar operations in -rrb- italy and france , carries a very strong message to groups and organizations providing financial resources for terrorist activities , " davutoglu said .
the arrests have led the pkk to call for mass protests in brussels and " all parts of kurdistan " a reference to kurdish-populated areas in turkey , iraq , iran , and syria .
the pkk began fighting with turkey some 26 years ago in a quest for a separate kurdish state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 04.03.2010 winter weather is bad news for berlin 's holocaust memorial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracks are both a dilemma and an embarrassment berlin 's holocaust memorial has cracks in a large number of concrete slabs that form the centerpiece of the site near the german capital 's reichstag parliament building . the director of the foundation that oversees the memorial , which commemorates those killed by the nazi regime under adolf hitler , says most of the 2,711 concrete slabs are damaged only five years after the monument opened .
according to director uwe neumaerker , more than two-thirds of the slabs are damaged , and experts so far have found no remedy .
germany 's mass circulation daily bild reported that as many as 2,200 slabs - more than three-quarters of all the stone elements - have developed cracks due to frost and other weather factors .
the paper cited experts who say the whole memorial , which originally cost nearly 28 million euros -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- , may have to be razed due to the instability of the slabs .
wrong kind of instability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the holocaust memorial at the unveiling of the monument in berlin five years ago , us architect peter eisenman said the work was " not too esthetic , and , of course , the experience of uncertainty and instability that we wanted is present in the memorial . "
at the time , he was clearly referring to the concept of his design and not to any sort of physical instability of the stones that form the pillars of the memorial field .
reports of some of the concrete slabs showing thin cracks first appeared in the media four years ago .
adam kerpel-fronius , from the memorial foundation , told deutsche welle that the problem was not new .
" this memorial site is not a small place .
we ourselves need about three days to look at all the slabs and find the cracks .
we do this on an annual basis to find out the state the memorial is in .
we last did so in october , and we 'll certainly do it again when the winter is over , " he said .
the cause is still unknown there have been attempts in the past to repair the damage with a synthetic resin injected into the cracks .
however , these attempts have not produced the desired results and a better technical solution , which would also better reflect the esthetic considerations , is not yet in sight .
mr. fronius said it was not even clear whether the increase in the number of cracks was really a direct result of the harsh winter weather .
he said a study has been commissioned to get to the heart of the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial has attracted more than eight million visitors " we are trying to find out , because scientifically it 's not established yet why the cracks appeared in the first place .
we do n't know , and the company -lrb- that built the memorial -rrb- does n't seem to know .
so , we have to establish the facts first , and that process is going on , " he said .
memorial still safe for visitors while the foundation admits that more and more cracks have appeared over time , it hastens to add that a structural analysis shows that the slabs are safe and are by no means in the process of falling apart , or of posing a danger to the visitors who walk around amongst them .
the foundation vehemently rejected the view voiced by the unnamed experts in the bild newspaper report , who suggested that the only solution would be to tear down the slabs and rebuild the memorial with more crack-resistant materials .
since the holocaust memorial opened , the field of slabs and the adjacent underground exhibition center have been a magnet for visitors .
over eight million people have walked through the monument , which is a stone 's throw from the reichstag and the brandenburg gate .

dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

the prestigious prizes honoring the year 's best pop and rock music will be awarded in berlin on thursday . it 's the most anticipated evening in german pop music : the echo awards for rock and pop will be presented in berlin on thursday evening .
nominees include lady gaga , david guetta , and the black eyed peas as well as german bands silbermond and ich + ich . as the german equivalent of the grammys or the brit pop awards , the echo awards differ from their anglophile counterparts in one critical way : the echos give nearly equal focus to german and international artists . nominations are divided into ' domestic ' and ' international ' categories .

" we have international stars like rihanna or robbie williams , who will perform in english , and we have artists like peter maffay , who will present his songs in german , " knoell said . in addition to the usual categories of " best artist " , and " best band , " the echo awards also feature nominations for the best german folk music and best german " schlager " singer . sold-out show this year 's echo event is noticeably smaller than last year 's , which boasted a record audience of 10,000 fans in the o2 arena in berlin .
but the tickets for the 2010 echos awards , which will be held at a smaller venue with space for about 4,000 guests , were still a hot commodity .

how are experts in asia reacting to this possible shift in us nuclear policy ? it has been nearly a year since us president barack obama unveiled his vision for a nuclear free world .
in a speech in the czech capital prague last april , he claimed america was committed ' to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons ' .
now his vision seems to be taking shape .
the new us nuclear policy review is expected to be announced in the next few weeks .
and as media reports suggest , the obama administration is likely to reduce its nuclear stockpile drastically and boost its conventional weapons capabilities .
the move will attract a lot of attention in asia , says commodore uday bhaskar , a security analyst in india .
" my sense is that the countries like india are looking at it with a lot of interest because these are objectives that india has been supporting and espousing for many decades and there has not been any serious international effort towards this end for many years . "
role of bigger nuclear powers despite india 's traditional stand on nuclear disarmament , it conducted nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998 and declared that it possessed nuclear capability .
its neighbor pakistan acquired nuclear weapons as well , stressing it needed them for defense against neighbors particularly india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a site of india ’ s nuclear test in 1998 neither country has signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty and experts doubt if they will ever give up their nuclear weapons as long as their relations remain strained .
moreover there is a school of thought that believes that the initiative to eliminate nuclear weapons should come from bigger nuclear powers .
" there are some 23,000 weapons all over the world .
out of this 22,000 are shared between us and russia , " says retired gen. talat masood , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the remaining one thousand are with other countries .
so i do n't think anyone should expect any change among other nuclear powers .
the lead has to come from us , russia , and then followed by other permanent un members and india , pakistan and israel . "
china 's dilemma china , on the other hand , has long maintained that it opposes nuclear proliferation and that its nuclear strategy is purely for self defense .
but its substantial increases in military budgets in recent years have sent signals that it wants to surpass the us as the world 's top military power .
oliver thränert , an expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , explains : " china thinks that the overwhelming superiority of the us in terms of its conventional weaponry means that a world without nuclear weapons would be a world in which the dominance of the us would be even clearer than now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea ’ s nuclear facilities at yongbyon north korea nuclear issue the idea of global nuclear disarmament has got considerable support in the northeast asia though , particularly in japan , the only country to have suffered nuclear bombardment .
the hatoyama government is seeking to denuclearize northeast asia as one of its top priorities , says key-young son an expert on international affairs in japan .
he says any signs from the us towards denuclearization will also give a fresh push to the six party talks on north korea 's nuclear program that have remain stalled for the last few years and which aim at paving the way for a nuclear free korean peninsula : " one of the reasons why north korea is hesitating to take steps forward is that the north korean government does n't believe in any intentions of the obama administration , " says key-young son .
" if the obama administration is moving to build trust in terms of nuclear issues , i think it will obviously help in the restart of nuclear talks and also it might change the attitude of north korea in a more positive direction in the near future . "
during his prague speech , obama admitted that the goal of a nuclear free world would not be reached quickly .
experts say lessons could be learned from the earlier disarmament efforts such as the chemical weapons convention which came into force in 1997 after many long years of negotiation .

how are experts in asia reacting to this possible shift in us nuclear policy ? it has been nearly a year since us president barack obama unveiled his vision for a nuclear free world .

the new us nuclear policy review is expected to be announced in the next few weeks .
and as media reports suggest , the obama administration is likely to reduce its nuclear stockpile drastically and boost its conventional weapons capabilities .
the move will attract a lot of attention in asia , says commodore uday bhaskar , a security analyst in india .

the hatoyama government is seeking to denuclearize northeast asia as one of its top priorities , says key-young son an expert on international affairs in japan .
he says any signs from the us towards denuclearization will also give a fresh push to the six party talks on north korea 's nuclear program that have remain stalled for the last few years and which aim at paving the way for a nuclear free korean peninsula : " one of the reasons why north korea is hesitating to take steps forward is that the north korean government does n't believe in any intentions of the obama administration , " says key-young son .
" if the obama administration is moving to build trust in terms of nuclear issues , i think it will obviously help in the restart of nuclear talks and also it might change the attitude of north korea in a more positive direction in the near future . "
during his prague speech , obama admitted that the goal of a nuclear free world would not be reached quickly .
experts say lessons could be learned from the earlier disarmament efforts such as the chemical weapons convention which came into force in 1997 after many long years of negotiation .

but its substantial increases in military budgets in recent years have sent signals that it wants to surpass the us as the world 's top military power .
oliver thränert , an expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , explains : " china thinks that the overwhelming superiority of the us in terms of its conventional weaponry means that a world without nuclear weapons would be a world in which the dominance of the us would be even clearer than now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea ’ s nuclear facilities at yongbyon north korea nuclear issue the idea of global nuclear disarmament has got considerable support in the northeast asia though , particularly in japan , the only country to have suffered nuclear bombardment .
the hatoyama government is seeking to denuclearize northeast asia as one of its top priorities , says key-young son an expert on international affairs in japan .
he says any signs from the us towards denuclearization will also give a fresh push to the six party talks on north korea 's nuclear program that have remain stalled for the last few years and which aim at paving the way for a nuclear free korean peninsula : " one of the reasons why north korea is hesitating to take steps forward is that the north korean government does n't believe in any intentions of the obama administration , " says key-young son .
" if the obama administration is moving to build trust in terms of nuclear issues , i think it will obviously help in the restart of nuclear talks and also it might change the attitude of north korea in a more positive direction in the near future . "
during his prague speech , obama admitted that the goal of a nuclear free world would not be reached quickly .
experts say lessons could be learned from the earlier disarmament efforts such as the chemical weapons convention which came into force in 1997 after many long years of negotiation .

according to director uwe neumaerker , more than two-thirds of the slabs are damaged , and experts so far have found no remedy .
germany 's mass circulation daily bild reported that as many as 2,200 slabs - more than three-quarters of all the stone elements - have developed cracks due to frost and other weather factors .
the paper cited experts who say the whole memorial , which originally cost nearly 28 million euros -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- , may have to be razed due to the instability of the slabs .
wrong kind of instability bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aerial view of the holocaust memorial at the unveiling of the monument in berlin five years ago , us architect peter eisenman said the work was " not too esthetic , and , of course , the experience of uncertainty and instability that we wanted is present in the memorial . "
at the time , he was clearly referring to the concept of his design and not to any sort of physical instability of the stones that form the pillars of the memorial field .
reports of some of the concrete slabs showing thin cracks first appeared in the media four years ago .
adam kerpel-fronius , from the memorial foundation , told deutsche welle that the problem was not new .
" this memorial site is not a small place .
we ourselves need about three days to look at all the slabs and find the cracks .
we do this on an annual basis to find out the state the memorial is in .
we last did so in october , and we 'll certainly do it again when the winter is over , " he said .
the cause is still unknown there have been attempts in the past to repair the damage with a synthetic resin injected into the cracks .
however , these attempts have not produced the desired results and a better technical solution , which would also better reflect the esthetic considerations , is not yet in sight .
mr. fronius said it was not even clear whether the increase in the number of cracks was really a direct result of the harsh winter weather .
he said a study has been commissioned to get to the heart of the matter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memorial has attracted more than eight million visitors " we are trying to find out , because scientifically it 's not established yet why the cracks appeared in the first place .
we do n't know , and the company -lrb- that built the memorial -rrb- does n't seem to know .
so , we have to establish the facts first , and that process is going on , " he said .
memorial still safe for visitors while the foundation admits that more and more cracks have appeared over time , it hastens to add that a structural analysis shows that the slabs are safe and are by no means in the process of falling apart , or of posing a danger to the visitors who walk around amongst them .
the foundation vehemently rejected the view voiced by the unnamed experts in the bild newspaper report , who suggested that the only solution would be to tear down the slabs and rebuild the memorial with more crack-resistant materials .
since the holocaust memorial opened , the field of slabs and the adjacent underground exhibition center have been a magnet for visitors .
over eight million people have walked through the monument , which is a stone 's throw from the reichstag and the brandenburg gate .

memorial still safe for visitors while the foundation admits that more and more cracks have appeared over time , it hastens to add that a structural analysis shows that the slabs are safe and are by no means in the process of falling apart , or of posing a danger to the visitors who walk around amongst them .
the foundation vehemently rejected the view voiced by the unnamed experts in the bild newspaper report , who suggested that the only solution would be to tear down the slabs and rebuild the memorial with more crack-resistant materials .
since the holocaust memorial opened , the field of slabs and the adjacent underground exhibition center have been a magnet for visitors .
over eight million people have walked through the monument , which is a stone 's throw from the reichstag and the brandenburg gate .

a french nun had claimed that she was cured of parkinson 's disease after praying to john paul and asking him to intercede on her behalf .
but the italian daily la repubblica said in thursday 's online edition that the vatican 's medical commission determined that the woman 's diagnosis was not fully confirmed , and that some people who have certain variants of the disease have been known to recover spontaneously .
a newspaper in poland , rzeczpospolita , had earlier reported that the nun 's disease had returned .
but that claim was rejected by the priest charged with investigating john paul 's case for beatification , the step which precedes being declared a saint .
still on the road to sainthood john paul , who died in 2005 , was put on a fast track to sainthood just a month after his death by his successor , pope benedict xvi .
the catholic church normally requires a waiting period of five years after a potential candidate 's death before the process can begin , but this was waived in john paul 's case .
but the case is far from derailed - vatican investigators can now put forward one of the 271 other reported miracles attributed to john paul. svs / kna / dpad / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

where tourists from all over the world usually take pictures , there are now police and soldiers .
they are there to keep peace and order for the 3,000 delegates who meet annually to discuss legislation .
skyrocketing real-estate prices , rampant corruption and disparities between the rich and the poor .
political scientist , gu xuewu from bonn university , believes this year , the national people 's congress will focus on domestic affairs .
experts say reorganizing the economy is at the top of the list .
one of beijing 's long term goals is to increase domestic demand and reduce exports .
gu xuewu does not expect anything world-shaking to come out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national people 's congress in beijings great hall of the people of the meeting .
" heads of the party will use the national people 's congress to test the reaction and the atmosphere among the people .
big decisions wo n't be made until after the meeting , when the politbureau meets again . "
the national people 's congress formally represents the voice of the chinese people and it is china 's highest legislative organ .
but the so-called " army of voters " only gives its approval to suggestions made by the party .
it is quite normal to have delegates vote 90 percent in favor on any random topic .
controversial discussions are very rare .
there was one in 1992 , when one third of the delegates voted against the construction of the three gorges dam project .
the npc has no say according to gu , when it comes to political decision making , the national people 's congress has no say : " when it comes to politics , to setting guidelines , political decisions are not made by the congress , but by the politbureau .
it is the party in china that retains the real power . "
what goes on behind the red velvet curtain in the great hall of the people , involves making private pacts and weaving webs of intrigues .
in two years there will be a generation change in party command .
cheng li of the brookings institute in washington says many are likely to be using the congress ' spotlight to spread their names throughout china . li thinks this goes especially for one man : party secretary of the city chongqing , bo xilai .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bo xilai is one of the leaders in spotlight " he is a self-made man , media-friendly and this is just one further event for him .
he already belongs to the 25-member politbureau .
he could very well become a member of the politbureau standing committee in two year 's time . "
the star of chinese politics bo xilai is the new star of the chinese politbureau .
born to a veteran of the revolution , he became known throughout china for cracking down on criminal gangs in chongqing .
the party newspaper named him man of the year .
bo xilai has held many party and government offices .
ex-party leader , jiang zemin , is one of his supporters .
but bo xilai is a controvercial figure .
some party members do n't agree with his take-no-gruff style .
but the people love him , it would seem .
bo 's rival in the fight for a seat in the politbureau standing committee is wang yang .
yang is the head of government in the rich guandong province .
he was a member of the communist youth league and is said to be president hu jintao 's protégé .
wang was bo xilai 's predecessor as party secretary of chongqing .
many believe bo xilai 's clampdown against organized crime was born out of spite for his predecessor .
but who will win in this power struggle has yet to be seen .

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 04.03.2010 eu should drop failed sanctions policy against burma , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu sanctions have failed to win the release of burmese opposition leader aung san suu kyi while the eu announced a humanitarian aid package for burma this week , it left in place its 14-year old sanctions regime against the country .
experts say misguided sanctions are the wrong approach and counterproductive . on tuesday , the european union pledged to provide 17.3 million euros -lrb- $ 23.4 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid this year to burma .
most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .
while the eu aid package may provide much needed short-term help for burma , also know as myanmar , which ranks 138th out of 182 nations in the united nation 's human development index , it does n't address the most critical issue in europe 's dealings with the country , say experts .
since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "
bildunterschrift : the military rules with an iron fist over burma while the eu and the us have slapped sanctions against burma , most other countries have not , making it easy for the regime to circumvent the sanctions by dealing with other nations . " myanmar is ravaged by chinese businesses that extract natural resources , " says swanström .
" we have no possibility to influence that , so in a sense we lose every possibility to have an impact . "
counterproductive measures what 's more , says michael von hauff , an economist and burma expert at the university of kaiserslautern , the sanctions are not just ineffective , they are actually counterproductive and hurt not the ruling clique , but the burmese people .
" the living conditions of the people have deteriorated and for example many young women in the textile sector lost their jobs , " he told deutsche welle . recent events tend to underscore the experts ' perception that the junta 's demeanor and stance has not been altered by the sanctions regime .
last month , an american citizen and human rights activist was sentenced to five years in prison for forging an identity card .
shortly thereafter , four other human rights activists were sentenced to prison terms on the day of the arrival of the un 's human rights envoy .
during his five day-trip , un envoy tomas ojea quintana was n't allowed to visit aung san suu kyi .
instead of sanctions , the eu should try to engage in a dialogue with the regime .
this dialogue policy should n't focus primarily on the junta leaders , but rather on mid-level government officials , says von hauff .
he has been travelling to burma regularly since 2001 to hold seminars and made an important observation : " it was really interesting that most of the people from the ministries were very open .
we could discuss all the problems and also the human rights situation .
so we should have a differentiated picture of the country . "
push from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : childen suffer especially from the dismal economic situation in burma but in order to engage the government effectively , the eu must first drop its current failed sanctions policy , argue von hauff and swanström .
only than can it regain any possible leverage on the junta , which it lost through the sanctions .
whether and when that could happen neither of the experts venture to say .
the push to change the eu 's policy toward burma could come once again from the us .
washington has recently sent some signals that it is rethinking its sanctions regime . should washington decide to change its policy , the eu would probably do so as well , says von hauff .
" i have the feeling that we have the sanctions because the united states has sanctions and so the eu has to have sanctions as well . "

most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .
while the eu aid package may provide much needed short-term help for burma , also know as myanmar , which ranks 138th out of 182 nations in the united nation 's human development index , it does n't address the most critical issue in europe 's dealings with the country , say experts .
since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "
bildunterschrift : the military rules with an iron fist over burma while the eu and the us have slapped sanctions against burma , most other countries have not , making it easy for the regime to circumvent the sanctions by dealing with other nations . " myanmar is ravaged by chinese businesses that extract natural resources , " says swanström .
" we have no possibility to influence that , so in a sense we lose every possibility to have an impact . "
counterproductive measures what 's more , says michael von hauff , an economist and burma expert at the university of kaiserslautern , the sanctions are not just ineffective , they are actually counterproductive and hurt not the ruling clique , but the burmese people .
" the living conditions of the people have deteriorated and for example many young women in the textile sector lost their jobs , " he told deutsche welle . recent events tend to underscore the experts ' perception that the junta 's demeanor and stance has not been altered by the sanctions regime .
last month , an american citizen and human rights activist was sentenced to five years in prison for forging an identity card .
shortly thereafter , four other human rights activists were sentenced to prison terms on the day of the arrival of the un 's human rights envoy .
during his five day-trip , un envoy tomas ojea quintana was n't allowed to visit aung san suu kyi .
instead of sanctions , the eu should try to engage in a dialogue with the regime .
this dialogue policy should n't focus primarily on the junta leaders , but rather on mid-level government officials , says von hauff .
he has been travelling to burma regularly since 2001 to hold seminars and made an important observation : " it was really interesting that most of the people from the ministries were very open .
we could discuss all the problems and also the human rights situation .
so we should have a differentiated picture of the country . "
push from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : childen suffer especially from the dismal economic situation in burma but in order to engage the government effectively , the eu must first drop its current failed sanctions policy , argue von hauff and swanström .
only than can it regain any possible leverage on the junta , which it lost through the sanctions .
whether and when that could happen neither of the experts venture to say .
the push to change the eu 's policy toward burma could come once again from the us .
washington has recently sent some signals that it is rethinking its sanctions regime . should washington decide to change its policy , the eu would probably do so as well , says von hauff .

experts say misguided sanctions are the wrong approach and counterproductive . on tuesday , the european union pledged to provide 17.3 million euros -lrb- $ 23.4 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid this year to burma .
most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .
while the eu aid package may provide much needed short-term help for burma , also know as myanmar , which ranks 138th out of 182 nations in the united nation 's human development index , it does n't address the most critical issue in europe 's dealings with the country , say experts .
since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "
bildunterschrift : the military rules with an iron fist over burma while the eu and the us have slapped sanctions against burma , most other countries have not , making it easy for the regime to circumvent the sanctions by dealing with other nations . " myanmar is ravaged by chinese businesses that extract natural resources , " says swanström .
" we have no possibility to influence that , so in a sense we lose every possibility to have an impact . "
counterproductive measures what 's more , says michael von hauff , an economist and burma expert at the university of kaiserslautern , the sanctions are not just ineffective , they are actually counterproductive and hurt not the ruling clique , but the burmese people .
" the living conditions of the people have deteriorated and for example many young women in the textile sector lost their jobs , " he told deutsche welle . recent events tend to underscore the experts ' perception that the junta 's demeanor and stance has not been altered by the sanctions regime .
last month , an american citizen and human rights activist was sentenced to five years in prison for forging an identity card .
shortly thereafter , four other human rights activists were sentenced to prison terms on the day of the arrival of the un 's human rights envoy .
during his five day-trip , un envoy tomas ojea quintana was n't allowed to visit aung san suu kyi .
instead of sanctions , the eu should try to engage in a dialogue with the regime .
this dialogue policy should n't focus primarily on the junta leaders , but rather on mid-level government officials , says von hauff .
he has been travelling to burma regularly since 2001 to hold seminars and made an important observation : " it was really interesting that most of the people from the ministries were very open .
we could discuss all the problems and also the human rights situation .
so we should have a differentiated picture of the country . "
push from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : childen suffer especially from the dismal economic situation in burma but in order to engage the government effectively , the eu must first drop its current failed sanctions policy , argue von hauff and swanström .
only than can it regain any possible leverage on the junta , which it lost through the sanctions .
whether and when that could happen neither of the experts venture to say .
the push to change the eu 's policy toward burma could come once again from the us .
washington has recently sent some signals that it is rethinking its sanctions regime . should washington decide to change its policy , the eu would probably do so as well , says von hauff .
" i have the feeling that we have the sanctions because the united states has sanctions and so the eu has to have sanctions as well . "

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

yang is the head of government in the rich guandong province .
he was a member of the communist youth league and is said to be president hu jintao 's protégé .
wang was bo xilai 's predecessor as party secretary of chongqing .
many believe bo xilai 's clampdown against organized crime was born out of spite for his predecessor .

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .

besides reaffirming their mutual respect for one another 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , pledging broader , stronger and deeper ties , the two republics firmly stated their aim to promote economic cooperation and trade .
a document resulting from their partnership agreement said the two sides had expressed a readiness to “ ensure continuous and steady growth of bilateral trade and gradually improve the balance of bilateral trade through development in accordance with the principle of equality , mutual benefit , reciprocity and win-win result . ”
a few months down the line the export import bank of china -lrb- china eximbank -rrb- has granted belgrade a billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- loan to upgrade two power plants and build a much-needed bridge over the beautiful blue danube .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bridge would help unclog belgrade 's traffic the bridge project , which is due to get underway in the spring , is critical both as a means of easing the traffic situation in belgrade , and as a test of how well china can work with its south-eastern european partner .

" there are a lot of projects we would like the chinese to do , " he said .
" but they want to see how it turns out first . "
what 's good for one … and serbia is not the only country in the balkans which embraces the idea of a free-flowing yuan .
dusan reljic from the eu external relations division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that chinese presence is gathering momentum right across the region .
" the chinese are in slovenia , in macedonia , they 're exporting buses to skopje , they 're talking to croatia about transport facilities , harbors , airports , railway connections , " he said " and they 've been talking to the greeks about leasing possibilities in athens harbor . "
analysts have described china 's arrival in the balkans as an effort to get into europe through the back door .
but kerry brown of the asia program at london 's chatham house , disputes the need for sneaking in through the rear when the " front door is wide open . "
citing telecommunications and automotive high-tech retail industries as examples , he told deutsche welle that chinese investors are already in europe .
win-win result ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pireus harbor in athens dusan reljic agrees , but says taking the direct route to greater eu presence would be more costly for china than investing in territories poised to join within the next 10 to 15 years .
" it 's cheaper to buy assets there -lsb- southern-eastern europe -rsb- than within the present european union , " the expert said .
a cheap ride for china , but what 's in it for the conduit countries like serbia ?
" a good deal , " says reljic .
with very little direct foreign investment coming into the region , tight government budgets and unemployment rates on the rise again , he says balkan states need and welcome china 's money , which comes with grace periods , generously low interest rates and very few strings attached .
" the chinese do not attach economic or political conditions to their loans , " reljic said .
" in a way , cheap chinese money is an alternative to commercially expensive western money or politically expensive money from the international monetary fund or the world bank . "
the politics of economics but money is not the only factor at play .
reljic says beijing 's activities in the balkans are as much about political positioning as they are about financial returns .
" this increased presence is also a signal to the us and the west that china is no longer a peripheral world power , but it is the world power and it is engaging in all political developments throughout the world with its own agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kosovo is serbia " graffiti is testimony to kosovo 's disputed independence an example of that agenda is beijing 's vehement opposition to kosovo 's independence .
china recently spoke out against kosovo 's split from serbia at the international court of justice in the hague .
yet many analysts would say such public displays of support have less to do with china 's concern over stability in the balkans region than with a concern that its own minority groups might follow kosovo 's lead towards independence .
and that , says kerry brown is " absolutely not what they want . "
weighing it up so what do they want ?
" china wants to remake the world and is disappointed that the world wo n't comply . "
brown said .
" it is guided by self-interest and is happy to abuse friendships . "
he says china , which has itself stated its national aim of becoming a strong and wealthy country , is often hard for foreign partners to understand , which is why smaller countries like those in the balkans should be aware of what they want from a partnership with beijing .
" if countries say yes to everything , they have the complication of becoming a tributary state of china . "
but the nip official told deutsche welle such problems would not arise between belgrade and beijing .

as brussels painstakingly deliberates the merits of aspiring european union members in the balkans , beijing has begun an investment offensive in the region .
but is china ’ s money talking economics or politics ? last year , presidents hu jintao of china and boris tadic of serbia cemented their bilateral relations and traditional friendship with a strategic partnership .
besides reaffirming their mutual respect for one another 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , pledging broader , stronger and deeper ties , the two republics firmly stated their aim to promote economic cooperation and trade .
a document resulting from their partnership agreement said the two sides had expressed a readiness to “ ensure continuous and steady growth of bilateral trade and gradually improve the balance of bilateral trade through development in accordance with the principle of equality , mutual benefit , reciprocity and win-win result . ”
a few months down the line the export import bank of china -lrb- china eximbank -rrb- has granted belgrade a billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- loan to upgrade two power plants and build a much-needed bridge over the beautiful blue danube .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bridge would help unclog belgrade 's traffic the bridge project , which is due to get underway in the spring , is critical both as a means of easing the traffic situation in belgrade , and as a test of how well china can work with its south-eastern european partner .
an official from the cabinet of serbia 's national investment plan -lrb- nip -rrb- , who preferred not to be named , told deutsche welle that continued chinese presence in the region hinges on the success of the bridge scheme . " there are a lot of projects we would like the chinese to do , " he said .
" but they want to see how it turns out first . "
what 's good for one … and serbia is not the only country in the balkans which embraces the idea of a free-flowing yuan .
dusan reljic from the eu external relations division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that chinese presence is gathering momentum right across the region .
" the chinese are in slovenia , in macedonia , they 're exporting buses to skopje , they 're talking to croatia about transport facilities , harbors , airports , railway connections , " he said " and they 've been talking to the greeks about leasing possibilities in athens harbor . "
analysts have described china 's arrival in the balkans as an effort to get into europe through the back door .
but kerry brown of the asia program at london 's chatham house , disputes the need for sneaking in through the rear when the " front door is wide open . "
citing telecommunications and automotive high-tech retail industries as examples , he told deutsche welle that chinese investors are already in europe .
win-win result ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pireus harbor in athens dusan reljic agrees , but says taking the direct route to greater eu presence would be more costly for china than investing in territories poised to join within the next 10 to 15 years .
" it 's cheaper to buy assets there -lsb- southern-eastern europe -rsb- than within the present european union , " the expert said .
a cheap ride for china , but what 's in it for the conduit countries like serbia ?
" a good deal , " says reljic .
with very little direct foreign investment coming into the region , tight government budgets and unemployment rates on the rise again , he says balkan states need and welcome china 's money , which comes with grace periods , generously low interest rates and very few strings attached .
" the chinese do not attach economic or political conditions to their loans , " reljic said .
" in a way , cheap chinese money is an alternative to commercially expensive western money or politically expensive money from the international monetary fund or the world bank . "
the politics of economics but money is not the only factor at play .
reljic says beijing 's activities in the balkans are as much about political positioning as they are about financial returns .
" this increased presence is also a signal to the us and the west that china is no longer a peripheral world power , but it is the world power and it is engaging in all political developments throughout the world with its own agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kosovo is serbia " graffiti is testimony to kosovo 's disputed independence an example of that agenda is beijing 's vehement opposition to kosovo 's independence .
china recently spoke out against kosovo 's split from serbia at the international court of justice in the hague .
yet many analysts would say such public displays of support have less to do with china 's concern over stability in the balkans region than with a concern that its own minority groups might follow kosovo 's lead towards independence .
and that , says kerry brown is " absolutely not what they want . "
weighing it up so what do they want ?
" china wants to remake the world and is disappointed that the world wo n't comply . "
brown said .
" it is guided by self-interest and is happy to abuse friendships . "
he says china , which has itself stated its national aim of becoming a strong and wealthy country , is often hard for foreign partners to understand , which is why smaller countries like those in the balkans should be aware of what they want from a partnership with beijing .
" if countries say yes to everything , they have the complication of becoming a tributary state of china . "
but the nip official told deutsche welle such problems would not arise between belgrade and beijing .
" according to domestic law , we are obliged to hire third-party supervision , " he said .
" the chinese will not be given free reign to do whatever they want , no matter who they are dealing with . "

these would be " the most nationally-focused local elections ever , " the leftist volkskrant newspaper said as pollsters predicted a tough ride for the two biggest parties - the christian democratic appeal -lrb- cda -rrb- and the labor party -lrb- pvda -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende 's cabinet collapsed in february rising tide the toughest challenge came from geert wilders ' far-right party for freedom -lrb- pvv -rrb- party , set up in 2006 to " stop the islamization of the netherlands . "
the pvv contested only two cities in its first municipal election , three months ahead of early general elections on june 9 .
the pvv holds nine seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament .
" we 're going to take the netherlands back from the leftist elite that coddles criminals and supports islamization , " freedom party leader geert wilders said early thursday .
wilders ' party came in second in the european elections of june last year , with 16.7 percent of the vote , behind the christian democrats of outgoing premier jan peter balkenende .
according to the results from 96 of the 98 polling stations , the pvv finished substantially ahead of the pvda in almere , with 21.6 percent of the vote .
the pvda , winners of the previous elections in 2006 , got 17.6 percent .
" what is possible in the hague and almere is possible all over the country .
it 's a springboard for our victory , " wilders told his supporters in almere .
gains in the heart of holland in the hague , the country 's political capital , the pvv came in second behind the pvda , though complete results were not yet available .

a first-half strike by gonzalo higuain was enough to secure a 1-0 victory over jogi loew 's hapless men . gonzalo higuain clipped a neat goal over the onrushing german goalkeeper rene adler to give diego maradona 's argentina an away win to a lackluster germany in munich 's allianz stadium .
germany was arguably maradona 's biggest scalp so far in his short career as argentina 's national coach , and the world cup legend made clear afterwards how seriously he had taken the challenge .
" we needed to show ourselves we could do what we did today , " maradona said in the post-match press conference .
" we wanted to show against a good team that we are alive and we understand the moment of the argentine national team , which has not won the world cup for 24 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona claimed his first high-profile scalp in munich reporters could not help but be reminded of the two famous world cup finals , both featuring maradona , germany and argentina fought out in 1986 and 1990 .
adler 's howler the goal that decided wednesday 's friendly came after rene adler 's ill-advised decision to come out for a long ball knocked hopefully into the german half .
real madrid striker higuain , often overlooked by maradona and his predecessor alfio basile , beat adler to the ball by what the keeper later ruefully described as " that famous half-meter " and slotted home the finish .
throughout the rest of an edgy , tactical game , the german defence often resorted to rough-arm tactics to stop argentina 's star attackers lionel messi and angel di maria , though there was nothing they could do to stop a brilliant effort by the benfica player .
collecting veron 's pass about 25 metres from goal , di maria slipped his marker , thumped his shot against the crossbar and appeared to be smacked in the face by a defender immediately afterwards .
argentina dominate veron tried an even more spectacular effort early in the second half when adler failed to clear the ball properly and the estudiantes player lobbed the goalkeeper from about 40 meters only to see his effort just miss the target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friendly was one of the last warm-up games before the world cup germany came to life after cacau replaced the ineffective mesut oezil in the 67th minute , but while the brazilian-born forward tested argentinian keeper sergio romero with a powerful drive , he could do nothing to avert germany 's defeat , which marked the third game without a win for jogi loew 's men .
the frustrated german crowd watched most of the world cup warm-up match in silence , while argentinian supporters cheered as the south american powerhouses stroked the ball around in the dying minutes and greeted the final whistle with a resounding chorus of jeers .
" our mistake was not to take more risks up front , " concluded germany captain michael ballack after the game . according to fifa 's latest world rankings , germany is number five - four places above argentina at nine , one behind england .

a first-half strike by gonzalo higuain was enough to secure a 1-0 victory over jogi loew 's hapless men . gonzalo higuain clipped a neat goal over the onrushing german goalkeeper rene adler to give diego maradona 's argentina an away win to a lackluster germany in munich 's allianz stadium .
germany was arguably maradona 's biggest scalp so far in his short career as argentina 's national coach , and the world cup legend made clear afterwards how seriously he had taken the challenge .
" we needed to show ourselves we could do what we did today , " maradona said in the post-match press conference .
" we wanted to show against a good team that we are alive and we understand the moment of the argentine national team , which has not won the world cup for 24 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona claimed his first high-profile scalp in munich reporters could not help but be reminded of the two famous world cup finals , both featuring maradona , germany and argentina fought out in 1986 and 1990 .

dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .

wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .

but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 04.03.2010 flat outing shows loew and germany have much to do großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's coaching staff have plenty to think about after being outclassed by argentina , it 's clear the german national team have weaknesses in all phases of their game .
dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

the four defendants in the so-called ' sauerland ' cell had planned a " mass murder unrivaled in germany , " said federal prosecutor volker brinkmann in his closing argument .
" the plot still sends chills down one 's spine .
they appointed themselves masters over life and death . "
defense attorneys , however , called it " the largest failed terrorist attack . "
they had been asking for sentences of under ten years .
the defendants , self-confessed islamic militants , admitted to planning large-scale bomb attacks for the islamic jihad union -lrb- iju -rrb- against discos and bars frequented by americans , airports and us military facilities in germany .
the attacks had been planned for october 2007 , during a parliament vote to extend german participation in the nato force in afghanistan .
police caught the first three suspects , daniel schneider , fritz gelowicz and adem yilmaz , in september 2007 as they were preparing 410 kilograms of explosives – 100 times the amount used in the 2005 london bombings , prosectors said .
the fourth defendant , atilla selek , was later captured in turkey .
rainer wendt , the head of the german police association , told the bild newspaper 's online editions that the association welcomed the verdict .
" the judgement shows that the german justice system is determined to proceed rigorously and without compromise , " wendt said .
but he also cautioned that " one should not have any illusions that terrorists are deterred by prison sentences . " cmk / afp / ap / dpa / apn editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

a first-half strike by gonzalo higuain was enough to secure a 1-0 victory over jogi loew 's hapless men . gonzalo higuain clipped a neat goal over the onrushing german goalkeeper rene adler to give diego maradona 's argentina an away win to a lackluster germany in munich 's allianz stadium .
germany was arguably maradona 's biggest scalp so far in his short career as argentina 's national coach , and the world cup legend made clear afterwards how seriously he had taken the challenge .
" we needed to show ourselves we could do what we did today , " maradona said in the post-match press conference .
" we wanted to show against a good team that we are alive and we understand the moment of the argentine national team , which has not won the world cup for 24 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona claimed his first high-profile scalp in munich reporters could not help but be reminded of the two famous world cup finals , both featuring maradona , germany and argentina fought out in 1986 and 1990 .
adler 's howler the goal that decided wednesday 's friendly came after rene adler 's ill-advised decision to come out for a long ball knocked hopefully into the german half .
real madrid striker higuain , often overlooked by maradona and his predecessor alfio basile , beat adler to the ball by what the keeper later ruefully described as " that famous half-meter " and slotted home the finish .
throughout the rest of an edgy , tactical game , the german defence often resorted to rough-arm tactics to stop argentina 's star attackers lionel messi and angel di maria , though there was nothing they could do to stop a brilliant effort by the benfica player .
collecting veron 's pass about 25 metres from goal , di maria slipped his marker , thumped his shot against the crossbar and appeared to be smacked in the face by a defender immediately afterwards .
argentina dominate veron tried an even more spectacular effort early in the second half when adler failed to clear the ball properly and the estudiantes player lobbed the goalkeeper from about 40 meters only to see his effort just miss the target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friendly was one of the last warm-up games before the world cup germany came to life after cacau replaced the ineffective mesut oezil in the 67th minute , but while the brazilian-born forward tested argentinian keeper sergio romero with a powerful drive , he could do nothing to avert germany 's defeat , which marked the third game without a win for jogi loew 's men .
the frustrated german crowd watched most of the world cup warm-up match in silence , while argentinian supporters cheered as the south american powerhouses stroked the ball around in the dying minutes and greeted the final whistle with a resounding chorus of jeers .
" our mistake was not to take more risks up front , " concluded germany captain michael ballack after the game . according to fifa 's latest world rankings , germany is number five - four places above argentina at nine , one behind england .

terezia mora is taking refuge in a small courtyard movie theater .

bleak no-man 's land terezia mora was born in hungary and her family belonged to the country 's german minority .

as brussels painstakingly deliberates the merits of aspiring european union members in the balkans , beijing has begun an investment offensive in the region .
but is china ’ s money talking economics or politics ? last year , presidents hu jintao of china and boris tadic of serbia cemented their bilateral relations and traditional friendship with a strategic partnership .
besides reaffirming their mutual respect for one another 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , pledging broader , stronger and deeper ties , the two republics firmly stated their aim to promote economic cooperation and trade .
a document resulting from their partnership agreement said the two sides had expressed a readiness to “ ensure continuous and steady growth of bilateral trade and gradually improve the balance of bilateral trade through development in accordance with the principle of equality , mutual benefit , reciprocity and win-win result . ”
a few months down the line the export import bank of china -lrb- china eximbank -rrb- has granted belgrade a billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- loan to upgrade two power plants and build a much-needed bridge over the beautiful blue danube .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bridge would help unclog belgrade 's traffic the bridge project , which is due to get underway in the spring , is critical both as a means of easing the traffic situation in belgrade , and as a test of how well china can work with its south-eastern european partner .
an official from the cabinet of serbia 's national investment plan -lrb- nip -rrb- , who preferred not to be named , told deutsche welle that continued chinese presence in the region hinges on the success of the bridge scheme . " there are a lot of projects we would like the chinese to do , " he said .
" but they want to see how it turns out first . "
what 's good for one … and serbia is not the only country in the balkans which embraces the idea of a free-flowing yuan .
dusan reljic from the eu external relations division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that chinese presence is gathering momentum right across the region .
" the chinese are in slovenia , in macedonia , they 're exporting buses to skopje , they 're talking to croatia about transport facilities , harbors , airports , railway connections , " he said " and they 've been talking to the greeks about leasing possibilities in athens harbor . "
analysts have described china 's arrival in the balkans as an effort to get into europe through the back door .
but kerry brown of the asia program at london 's chatham house , disputes the need for sneaking in through the rear when the " front door is wide open . "
citing telecommunications and automotive high-tech retail industries as examples , he told deutsche welle that chinese investors are already in europe .
win-win result ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pireus harbor in athens dusan reljic agrees , but says taking the direct route to greater eu presence would be more costly for china than investing in territories poised to join within the next 10 to 15 years .
" it 's cheaper to buy assets there -lsb- southern-eastern europe -rsb- than within the present european union , " the expert said .
a cheap ride for china , but what 's in it for the conduit countries like serbia ?
" a good deal , " says reljic .
with very little direct foreign investment coming into the region , tight government budgets and unemployment rates on the rise again , he says balkan states need and welcome china 's money , which comes with grace periods , generously low interest rates and very few strings attached .
" the chinese do not attach economic or political conditions to their loans , " reljic said .
" in a way , cheap chinese money is an alternative to commercially expensive western money or politically expensive money from the international monetary fund or the world bank . "
the politics of economics but money is not the only factor at play .
reljic says beijing 's activities in the balkans are as much about political positioning as they are about financial returns .
" this increased presence is also a signal to the us and the west that china is no longer a peripheral world power , but it is the world power and it is engaging in all political developments throughout the world with its own agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kosovo is serbia " graffiti is testimony to kosovo 's disputed independence an example of that agenda is beijing 's vehement opposition to kosovo 's independence .
china recently spoke out against kosovo 's split from serbia at the international court of justice in the hague .
yet many analysts would say such public displays of support have less to do with china 's concern over stability in the balkans region than with a concern that its own minority groups might follow kosovo 's lead towards independence .
and that , says kerry brown is " absolutely not what they want . "
weighing it up so what do they want ?
" china wants to remake the world and is disappointed that the world wo n't comply . "
brown said .
" it is guided by self-interest and is happy to abuse friendships . "
he says china , which has itself stated its national aim of becoming a strong and wealthy country , is often hard for foreign partners to understand , which is why smaller countries like those in the balkans should be aware of what they want from a partnership with beijing .
" if countries say yes to everything , they have the complication of becoming a tributary state of china . "
but the nip official told deutsche welle such problems would not arise between belgrade and beijing .
" according to domestic law , we are obliged to hire third-party supervision , " he said .
" the chinese will not be given free reign to do whatever they want , no matter who they are dealing with . "

besides reaffirming their mutual respect for one another 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , pledging broader , stronger and deeper ties , the two republics firmly stated their aim to promote economic cooperation and trade .
a document resulting from their partnership agreement said the two sides had expressed a readiness to “ ensure continuous and steady growth of bilateral trade and gradually improve the balance of bilateral trade through development in accordance with the principle of equality , mutual benefit , reciprocity and win-win result . ”
a few months down the line the export import bank of china -lrb- china eximbank -rrb- has granted belgrade a billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- loan to upgrade two power plants and build a much-needed bridge over the beautiful blue danube .

an official from the cabinet of serbia 's national investment plan -lrb- nip -rrb- , who preferred not to be named , told deutsche welle that continued chinese presence in the region hinges on the success of the bridge scheme .

dusan reljic from the eu external relations division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that chinese presence is gathering momentum right across the region .
" the chinese are in slovenia , in macedonia , they 're exporting buses to skopje , they 're talking to croatia about transport facilities , harbors , airports , railway connections , " he said " and they 've been talking to the greeks about leasing possibilities in athens harbor . "

" a good deal , " says reljic .
with very little direct foreign investment coming into the region , tight government budgets and unemployment rates on the rise again , he says balkan states need and welcome china 's money , which comes with grace periods , generously low interest rates and very few strings attached .
" the chinese do not attach economic or political conditions to their loans , " reljic said .
" in a way , cheap chinese money is an alternative to commercially expensive western money or politically expensive money from the international monetary fund or the world bank . "
the politics of economics but money is not the only factor at play .
reljic says beijing 's activities in the balkans are as much about political positioning as they are about financial returns .
" this increased presence is also a signal to the us and the west that china is no longer a peripheral world power , but it is the world power and it is engaging in all political developments throughout the world with its own agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kosovo is serbia " graffiti is testimony to kosovo 's disputed independence an example of that agenda is beijing 's vehement opposition to kosovo 's independence .
china recently spoke out against kosovo 's split from serbia at the international court of justice in the hague .
yet many analysts would say such public displays of support have less to do with china 's concern over stability in the balkans region than with a concern that its own minority groups might follow kosovo 's lead towards independence .
and that , says kerry brown is " absolutely not what they want . "
weighing it up so what do they want ?

a few months down the line the export import bank of china -lrb- china eximbank -rrb- has granted belgrade a billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- loan to upgrade two power plants and build a much-needed bridge over the beautiful blue danube .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bridge would help unclog belgrade 's traffic the bridge project , which is due to get underway in the spring , is critical both as a means of easing the traffic situation in belgrade , and as a test of how well china can work with its south-eastern european partner .
an official from the cabinet of serbia 's national investment plan -lrb- nip -rrb- , who preferred not to be named , told deutsche welle that continued chinese presence in the region hinges on the success of the bridge scheme . " there are a lot of projects we would like the chinese to do , " he said .
" but they want to see how it turns out first . "
what 's good for one … and serbia is not the only country in the balkans which embraces the idea of a free-flowing yuan .
dusan reljic from the eu external relations division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that chinese presence is gathering momentum right across the region .
" the chinese are in slovenia , in macedonia , they 're exporting buses to skopje , they 're talking to croatia about transport facilities , harbors , airports , railway connections , " he said " and they 've been talking to the greeks about leasing possibilities in athens harbor . "
analysts have described china 's arrival in the balkans as an effort to get into europe through the back door .
but kerry brown of the asia program at london 's chatham house , disputes the need for sneaking in through the rear when the " front door is wide open . "
citing telecommunications and automotive high-tech retail industries as examples , he told deutsche welle that chinese investors are already in europe .
win-win result ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pireus harbor in athens dusan reljic agrees , but says taking the direct route to greater eu presence would be more costly for china than investing in territories poised to join within the next 10 to 15 years .
" it 's cheaper to buy assets there -lsb- southern-eastern europe -rsb- than within the present european union , " the expert said .
a cheap ride for china , but what 's in it for the conduit countries like serbia ?
" a good deal , " says reljic .
with very little direct foreign investment coming into the region , tight government budgets and unemployment rates on the rise again , he says balkan states need and welcome china 's money , which comes with grace periods , generously low interest rates and very few strings attached .
" the chinese do not attach economic or political conditions to their loans , " reljic said .
" in a way , cheap chinese money is an alternative to commercially expensive western money or politically expensive money from the international monetary fund or the world bank . "
the politics of economics but money is not the only factor at play .
reljic says beijing 's activities in the balkans are as much about political positioning as they are about financial returns .
" this increased presence is also a signal to the us and the west that china is no longer a peripheral world power , but it is the world power and it is engaging in all political developments throughout the world with its own agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kosovo is serbia " graffiti is testimony to kosovo 's disputed independence an example of that agenda is beijing 's vehement opposition to kosovo 's independence .
china recently spoke out against kosovo 's split from serbia at the international court of justice in the hague .
yet many analysts would say such public displays of support have less to do with china 's concern over stability in the balkans region than with a concern that its own minority groups might follow kosovo 's lead towards independence .
and that , says kerry brown is " absolutely not what they want . "
weighing it up so what do they want ?
" china wants to remake the world and is disappointed that the world wo n't comply . "
brown said .
" it is guided by self-interest and is happy to abuse friendships . "
he says china , which has itself stated its national aim of becoming a strong and wealthy country , is often hard for foreign partners to understand , which is why smaller countries like those in the balkans should be aware of what they want from a partnership with beijing .
" if countries say yes to everything , they have the complication of becoming a tributary state of china . "
but the nip official told deutsche welle such problems would not arise between belgrade and beijing .
" according to domestic law , we are obliged to hire third-party supervision , " he said .
" the chinese will not be given free reign to do whatever they want , no matter who they are dealing with . "

experts say misguided sanctions are the wrong approach and counterproductive . on tuesday , the european union pledged to provide 17.3 million euros -lrb- $ 23.4 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid this year to burma .
most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .
while the eu aid package may provide much needed short-term help for burma , also know as myanmar , which ranks 138th out of 182 nations in the united nation 's human development index , it does n't address the most critical issue in europe 's dealings with the country , say experts .
since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "
bildunterschrift : the military rules with an iron fist over burma while the eu and the us have slapped sanctions against burma , most other countries have not , making it easy for the regime to circumvent the sanctions by dealing with other nations . " myanmar is ravaged by chinese businesses that extract natural resources , " says swanström .
" we have no possibility to influence that , so in a sense we lose every possibility to have an impact . "
counterproductive measures what 's more , says michael von hauff , an economist and burma expert at the university of kaiserslautern , the sanctions are not just ineffective , they are actually counterproductive and hurt not the ruling clique , but the burmese people .
" the living conditions of the people have deteriorated and for example many young women in the textile sector lost their jobs , " he told deutsche welle . recent events tend to underscore the experts ' perception that the junta 's demeanor and stance has not been altered by the sanctions regime .
last month , an american citizen and human rights activist was sentenced to five years in prison for forging an identity card .
shortly thereafter , four other human rights activists were sentenced to prison terms on the day of the arrival of the un 's human rights envoy .
during his five day-trip , un envoy tomas ojea quintana was n't allowed to visit aung san suu kyi .
instead of sanctions , the eu should try to engage in a dialogue with the regime .
this dialogue policy should n't focus primarily on the junta leaders , but rather on mid-level government officials , says von hauff .
he has been travelling to burma regularly since 2001 to hold seminars and made an important observation : " it was really interesting that most of the people from the ministries were very open .
we could discuss all the problems and also the human rights situation .
so we should have a differentiated picture of the country . "
push from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : childen suffer especially from the dismal economic situation in burma but in order to engage the government effectively , the eu must first drop its current failed sanctions policy , argue von hauff and swanström .
only than can it regain any possible leverage on the junta , which it lost through the sanctions .
whether and when that could happen neither of the experts venture to say .
the push to change the eu 's policy toward burma could come once again from the us .
washington has recently sent some signals that it is rethinking its sanctions regime . should washington decide to change its policy , the eu would probably do so as well , says von hauff .
" i have the feeling that we have the sanctions because the united states has sanctions and so the eu has to have sanctions as well . "

experts say misguided sanctions are the wrong approach and counterproductive . on tuesday , the european union pledged to provide 17.3 million euros -lrb- $ 23.4 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid this year to burma .
most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .
while the eu aid package may provide much needed short-term help for burma , also know as myanmar , which ranks 138th out of 182 nations in the united nation 's human development index , it does n't address the most critical issue in europe 's dealings with the country , say experts .
since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "
bildunterschrift : the military rules with an iron fist over burma while the eu and the us have slapped sanctions against burma , most other countries have not , making it easy for the regime to circumvent the sanctions by dealing with other nations . " myanmar is ravaged by chinese businesses that extract natural resources , " says swanström .
" we have no possibility to influence that , so in a sense we lose every possibility to have an impact . "
counterproductive measures what 's more , says michael von hauff , an economist and burma expert at the university of kaiserslautern , the sanctions are not just ineffective , they are actually counterproductive and hurt not the ruling clique , but the burmese people .
" the living conditions of the people have deteriorated and for example many young women in the textile sector lost their jobs , " he told deutsche welle . recent events tend to underscore the experts ' perception that the junta 's demeanor and stance has not been altered by the sanctions regime .
last month , an american citizen and human rights activist was sentenced to five years in prison for forging an identity card .
shortly thereafter , four other human rights activists were sentenced to prison terms on the day of the arrival of the un 's human rights envoy .
during his five day-trip , un envoy tomas ojea quintana was n't allowed to visit aung san suu kyi .
instead of sanctions , the eu should try to engage in a dialogue with the regime .
this dialogue policy should n't focus primarily on the junta leaders , but rather on mid-level government officials , says von hauff .
he has been travelling to burma regularly since 2001 to hold seminars and made an important observation : " it was really interesting that most of the people from the ministries were very open .
we could discuss all the problems and also the human rights situation .
so we should have a differentiated picture of the country . "
push from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : childen suffer especially from the dismal economic situation in burma but in order to engage the government effectively , the eu must first drop its current failed sanctions policy , argue von hauff and swanström .
only than can it regain any possible leverage on the junta , which it lost through the sanctions .
whether and when that could happen neither of the experts venture to say .
the push to change the eu 's policy toward burma could come once again from the us .
washington has recently sent some signals that it is rethinking its sanctions regime . should washington decide to change its policy , the eu would probably do so as well , says von hauff .
" i have the feeling that we have the sanctions because the united states has sanctions and so the eu has to have sanctions as well . "

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

a first-half strike by gonzalo higuain was enough to secure a 1-0 victory over jogi loew 's hapless men . gonzalo higuain clipped a neat goal over the onrushing german goalkeeper rene adler to give diego maradona 's argentina an away win to a lackluster germany in munich 's allianz stadium .
germany was arguably maradona 's biggest scalp so far in his short career as argentina 's national coach , and the world cup legend made clear afterwards how seriously he had taken the challenge .
" we needed to show ourselves we could do what we did today , " maradona said in the post-match press conference .
" we wanted to show against a good team that we are alive and we understand the moment of the argentine national team , which has not won the world cup for 24 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona claimed his first high-profile scalp in munich reporters could not help but be reminded of the two famous world cup finals , both featuring maradona , germany and argentina fought out in 1986 and 1990 .
adler 's howler the goal that decided wednesday 's friendly came after rene adler 's ill-advised decision to come out for a long ball knocked hopefully into the german half .
real madrid striker higuain , often overlooked by maradona and his predecessor alfio basile , beat adler to the ball by what the keeper later ruefully described as " that famous half-meter " and slotted home the finish .
throughout the rest of an edgy , tactical game , the german defence often resorted to rough-arm tactics to stop argentina 's star attackers lionel messi and angel di maria , though there was nothing they could do to stop a brilliant effort by the benfica player .
collecting veron 's pass about 25 metres from goal , di maria slipped his marker , thumped his shot against the crossbar and appeared to be smacked in the face by a defender immediately afterwards .
argentina dominate veron tried an even more spectacular effort early in the second half when adler failed to clear the ball properly and the estudiantes player lobbed the goalkeeper from about 40 meters only to see his effort just miss the target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friendly was one of the last warm-up games before the world cup germany came to life after cacau replaced the ineffective mesut oezil in the 67th minute , but while the brazilian-born forward tested argentinian keeper sergio romero with a powerful drive , he could do nothing to avert germany 's defeat , which marked the third game without a win for jogi loew 's men .
the frustrated german crowd watched most of the world cup warm-up match in silence , while argentinian supporters cheered as the south american powerhouses stroked the ball around in the dying minutes and greeted the final whistle with a resounding chorus of jeers .
" our mistake was not to take more risks up front , " concluded germany captain michael ballack after the game . according to fifa 's latest world rankings , germany is number five - four places above argentina at nine , one behind england .

wilders ' party came in second in the european elections of june last year , with 16.7 percent of the vote , behind the christian democrats of outgoing premier jan peter balkenende .
according to the results from 96 of the 98 polling stations , the pvv finished substantially ahead of the pvda in almere , with 21.6 percent of the vote .
the pvda , winners of the previous elections in 2006 , got 17.6 percent .
" what is possible in the hague and almere is possible all over the country .
it 's a springboard for our victory , " wilders told his supporters in almere .
gains in the heart of holland in the hague , the country 's political capital , the pvv came in second behind the pvda , though complete results were not yet available .
most polls had predicted the pvv would come in first in almere , a city of 187,000 inhabitants east of the capital amsterdam , and second or third in the hague - the netherlands ' third largest city with 442,000 residents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister wouter bos withdrew his party from the coalition the results indicated that both the centrist parties were struggling ahead of national elections brought forward to june 9 ; the big winner being wilders ' pvv , now thought to be the country 's most popular political party .
some 12 million dutch out of a total 16.5 million were registered to vote in 394 municipalities for nearly 9,000 councillors countrywide .
capitalizing on broken coalition pvda leader wouter bos withdrew his party from the national government last month in a spat with balkenende 's cda over extending the dutch military mission in afghanistan .
the cda won 41 seats out of 150 in parliament in the previous round of national elections , the pvda 33 and the pvv nine .
wilders is awaiting trial for alleged hate speech against muslims for having likened the koran to hitler 's " mein kampf " and calling islam a fascist religion .
in 2006 municipal elections , the pvda came out on top with 23.45 percent of the vote nationally , ahead of the cda which got 16.83 percent .
final results of this year 's municipal elections will be released on friday. bk / ape / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say misguided sanctions are the wrong approach and counterproductive . on tuesday , the european union pledged to provide 17.3 million euros -lrb- $ 23.4 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid this year to burma .
most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .
while the eu aid package may provide much needed short-term help for burma , also know as myanmar , which ranks 138th out of 182 nations in the united nation 's human development index , it does n't address the most critical issue in europe 's dealings with the country , say experts .
since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "
bildunterschrift : the military rules with an iron fist over burma while the eu and the us have slapped sanctions against burma , most other countries have not , making it easy for the regime to circumvent the sanctions by dealing with other nations . " myanmar is ravaged by chinese businesses that extract natural resources , " says swanström .
" we have no possibility to influence that , so in a sense we lose every possibility to have an impact . "
counterproductive measures what 's more , says michael von hauff , an economist and burma expert at the university of kaiserslautern , the sanctions are not just ineffective , they are actually counterproductive and hurt not the ruling clique , but the burmese people .
" the living conditions of the people have deteriorated and for example many young women in the textile sector lost their jobs , " he told deutsche welle . recent events tend to underscore the experts ' perception that the junta 's demeanor and stance has not been altered by the sanctions regime .
last month , an american citizen and human rights activist was sentenced to five years in prison for forging an identity card .
shortly thereafter , four other human rights activists were sentenced to prison terms on the day of the arrival of the un 's human rights envoy .
during his five day-trip , un envoy tomas ojea quintana was n't allowed to visit aung san suu kyi .
instead of sanctions , the eu should try to engage in a dialogue with the regime .
this dialogue policy should n't focus primarily on the junta leaders , but rather on mid-level government officials , says von hauff .
he has been travelling to burma regularly since 2001 to hold seminars and made an important observation : " it was really interesting that most of the people from the ministries were very open .
we could discuss all the problems and also the human rights situation .
so we should have a differentiated picture of the country . "
push from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : childen suffer especially from the dismal economic situation in burma but in order to engage the government effectively , the eu must first drop its current failed sanctions policy , argue von hauff and swanström .
only than can it regain any possible leverage on the junta , which it lost through the sanctions .
whether and when that could happen neither of the experts venture to say .
the push to change the eu 's policy toward burma could come once again from the us .
washington has recently sent some signals that it is rethinking its sanctions regime . should washington decide to change its policy , the eu would probably do so as well , says von hauff .
" i have the feeling that we have the sanctions because the united states has sanctions and so the eu has to have sanctions as well . "

as brussels painstakingly deliberates the merits of aspiring european union members in the balkans , beijing has begun an investment offensive in the region .
but is china ’ s money talking economics or politics ? last year , presidents hu jintao of china and boris tadic of serbia cemented their bilateral relations and traditional friendship with a strategic partnership .
besides reaffirming their mutual respect for one another 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , pledging broader , stronger and deeper ties , the two republics firmly stated their aim to promote economic cooperation and trade .
a document resulting from their partnership agreement said the two sides had expressed a readiness to “ ensure continuous and steady growth of bilateral trade and gradually improve the balance of bilateral trade through development in accordance with the principle of equality , mutual benefit , reciprocity and win-win result . ”
a few months down the line the export import bank of china -lrb- china eximbank -rrb- has granted belgrade a billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- loan to upgrade two power plants and build a much-needed bridge over the beautiful blue danube .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bridge would help unclog belgrade 's traffic the bridge project , which is due to get underway in the spring , is critical both as a means of easing the traffic situation in belgrade , and as a test of how well china can work with its south-eastern european partner .
an official from the cabinet of serbia 's national investment plan -lrb- nip -rrb- , who preferred not to be named , told deutsche welle that continued chinese presence in the region hinges on the success of the bridge scheme . " there are a lot of projects we would like the chinese to do , " he said .
" but they want to see how it turns out first . "
what 's good for one … and serbia is not the only country in the balkans which embraces the idea of a free-flowing yuan .
dusan reljic from the eu external relations division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that chinese presence is gathering momentum right across the region .
" the chinese are in slovenia , in macedonia , they 're exporting buses to skopje , they 're talking to croatia about transport facilities , harbors , airports , railway connections , " he said " and they 've been talking to the greeks about leasing possibilities in athens harbor . "
analysts have described china 's arrival in the balkans as an effort to get into europe through the back door .
but kerry brown of the asia program at london 's chatham house , disputes the need for sneaking in through the rear when the " front door is wide open . "
citing telecommunications and automotive high-tech retail industries as examples , he told deutsche welle that chinese investors are already in europe .
win-win result ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pireus harbor in athens dusan reljic agrees , but says taking the direct route to greater eu presence would be more costly for china than investing in territories poised to join within the next 10 to 15 years .
" it 's cheaper to buy assets there -lsb- southern-eastern europe -rsb- than within the present european union , " the expert said .
a cheap ride for china , but what 's in it for the conduit countries like serbia ?
" a good deal , " says reljic .
with very little direct foreign investment coming into the region , tight government budgets and unemployment rates on the rise again , he says balkan states need and welcome china 's money , which comes with grace periods , generously low interest rates and very few strings attached .
" the chinese do not attach economic or political conditions to their loans , " reljic said .
" in a way , cheap chinese money is an alternative to commercially expensive western money or politically expensive money from the international monetary fund or the world bank . "
the politics of economics but money is not the only factor at play .
reljic says beijing 's activities in the balkans are as much about political positioning as they are about financial returns .
" this increased presence is also a signal to the us and the west that china is no longer a peripheral world power , but it is the world power and it is engaging in all political developments throughout the world with its own agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kosovo is serbia " graffiti is testimony to kosovo 's disputed independence an example of that agenda is beijing 's vehement opposition to kosovo 's independence .
china recently spoke out against kosovo 's split from serbia at the international court of justice in the hague .
yet many analysts would say such public displays of support have less to do with china 's concern over stability in the balkans region than with a concern that its own minority groups might follow kosovo 's lead towards independence .
and that , says kerry brown is " absolutely not what they want . "
weighing it up so what do they want ?
" china wants to remake the world and is disappointed that the world wo n't comply . "
brown said .
" it is guided by self-interest and is happy to abuse friendships . "
he says china , which has itself stated its national aim of becoming a strong and wealthy country , is often hard for foreign partners to understand , which is why smaller countries like those in the balkans should be aware of what they want from a partnership with beijing .
" if countries say yes to everything , they have the complication of becoming a tributary state of china . "
but the nip official told deutsche welle such problems would not arise between belgrade and beijing .
" according to domestic law , we are obliged to hire third-party supervision , " he said .
" the chinese will not be given free reign to do whatever they want , no matter who they are dealing with . "

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 04.03.2010 eu should drop failed sanctions policy against burma , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu sanctions have failed to win the release of burmese opposition leader aung san suu kyi while the eu announced a humanitarian aid package for burma this week , it left in place its 14-year old sanctions regime against the country .
experts say misguided sanctions are the wrong approach and counterproductive . on tuesday , the european union pledged to provide 17.3 million euros -lrb- $ 23.4 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid this year to burma .
most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .
while the eu aid package may provide much needed short-term help for burma , also know as myanmar , which ranks 138th out of 182 nations in the united nation 's human development index , it does n't address the most critical issue in europe 's dealings with the country , say experts .
since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "
bildunterschrift : the military rules with an iron fist over burma while the eu and the us have slapped sanctions against burma , most other countries have not , making it easy for the regime to circumvent the sanctions by dealing with other nations . " myanmar is ravaged by chinese businesses that extract natural resources , " says swanström .
" we have no possibility to influence that , so in a sense we lose every possibility to have an impact . "
counterproductive measures what 's more , says michael von hauff , an economist and burma expert at the university of kaiserslautern , the sanctions are not just ineffective , they are actually counterproductive and hurt not the ruling clique , but the burmese people .
" the living conditions of the people have deteriorated and for example many young women in the textile sector lost their jobs , " he told deutsche welle . recent events tend to underscore the experts ' perception that the junta 's demeanor and stance has not been altered by the sanctions regime .
last month , an american citizen and human rights activist was sentenced to five years in prison for forging an identity card .
shortly thereafter , four other human rights activists were sentenced to prison terms on the day of the arrival of the un 's human rights envoy .
during his five day-trip , un envoy tomas ojea quintana was n't allowed to visit aung san suu kyi .
instead of sanctions , the eu should try to engage in a dialogue with the regime .
this dialogue policy should n't focus primarily on the junta leaders , but rather on mid-level government officials , says von hauff .
he has been travelling to burma regularly since 2001 to hold seminars and made an important observation : " it was really interesting that most of the people from the ministries were very open .
we could discuss all the problems and also the human rights situation .
so we should have a differentiated picture of the country . "
push from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : childen suffer especially from the dismal economic situation in burma but in order to engage the government effectively , the eu must first drop its current failed sanctions policy , argue von hauff and swanström .
only than can it regain any possible leverage on the junta , which it lost through the sanctions .
whether and when that could happen neither of the experts venture to say .
the push to change the eu 's policy toward burma could come once again from the us .
washington has recently sent some signals that it is rethinking its sanctions regime . should washington decide to change its policy , the eu would probably do so as well , says von hauff .
" i have the feeling that we have the sanctions because the united states has sanctions and so the eu has to have sanctions as well . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bo xilai is one of the leaders in spotlight " he is a self-made man , media-friendly and this is just one further event for him .
he already belongs to the 25-member politbureau .
he could very well become a member of the politbureau standing committee in two year 's time . "
the star of chinese politics bo xilai is the new star of the chinese politbureau .
born to a veteran of the revolution , he became known throughout china for cracking down on criminal gangs in chongqing .
the party newspaper named him man of the year .
bo xilai has held many party and government offices .
ex-party leader , jiang zemin , is one of his supporters .
but bo xilai is a controvercial figure .
some party members do n't agree with his take-no-gruff style .
but the people love him , it would seem .
bo 's rival in the fight for a seat in the politbureau standing committee is wang yang .
yang is the head of government in the rich guandong province .
he was a member of the communist youth league and is said to be president hu jintao 's protégé .
wang was bo xilai 's predecessor as party secretary of chongqing .
many believe bo xilai 's clampdown against organized crime was born out of spite for his predecessor .
but who will win in this power struggle has yet to be seen .

dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .
bildunterschrift : oezil has n't looked this happy in months mesut oezil is another story .
in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .
since then , the wheels have come off .
özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .
the most natural stand-in for his role as orchestrator might be kroos , but handing over the keys to the team to a 20-year-old driver - with one cap to his name - would be a huge gamble .
attack up front might be germany 's weakest point of all .
the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .
at bayern munich , louis van gaal has all but decided miroslav klose is past it , using him as a substitute .
klose 's replacement in the bayern first team , mario gomez , has yet to show he has the efficiency with chances that is the hallmark of a true international-quality striker .
lukas podolski , meanwhile , both with his club cologne and now on wednesday with the national team , has performed so awfully over the last half a year that his coaches will have little choice but to bench him .
the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .
the leverkusen striker has scored just one of his 13 league goals since november .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's out of the running for the 2010 world cup beyond those two , the only legitimate alternatives are patrick helmes and kevin kuranyi - and each is likely to miss out on the world cup .
helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

in the first half of the bundesliga season , the 21-year-old was riding high with bremen , and coming off an outstanding european championship-winning campaign with the under-21 's .
he played well in a series of matches for germany -lrb- russia , south africa , ivory coast -rrb- and looked to be ready to assume the role of germany 's offensive lynchpin for years to come .

özil has n't had a dominant performance for his club in months , and looked similarly lost against argentina .

the team 's stalwarts of the past few years are off form , and there 's not a lot in the way of alternatives .

the bundesliga 's leading scorer stefan kiessling did n't play on wednesday - the first striker off the bench was stuttgart 's cacau .
perhaps the naturalized german citizen from brazil got the nod because he scored seven goals in the last three club matches leading up to the friendly .
it could also be because loew believes kiessling 's goalscoring touch has left him .

helmes spent most of the first half of the season recovering from an acl tear , and has yet to start a game - much less score - for leverkusen since .
the case of kuranyi is different .
he made himself persona non grata with loew two years ago when he abruptly left a germany-russia game at halftime , having been left out of the match day squad .
at the time loew 's decision to ban the schalke striker seemed an easy one .
but loew may yet miss him - or at least rue having said " never again . "
kuranyi 's 12 league goals so far this season have made him just the third player ever to go eight bundesliga seasons in a row with a double-digit scoring tally .
if german goals go missing in south africa , expect the name kuranyi to come up .

dw takes a look at the many question marks surrounding the team as the world cup approaches . in 100 days , germany will take the field in durban against australia in their first match of the world cup in south africa .
as germany has won the tournament three times - and been to the final in an additional four - fans expect their team to go deep into the competition .
but the squad 's poor showing from back to front on wednesday , along with some players ' untimely loss of form in the bundesliga , paints a cloudier picture .
goalkeeping germany 's problems start at the back , in the one position it 's not had to worry about in ages - in goal .
with past greats like oliver kahn and jens lehmann out of the picture , the last two years have been one long audition for the number one shirt .
since hanover goalkeeper robert enke 's startling suicide last year , it 's boiled down to a three-way affair between bayer leverkusen 's rene adler , werder bremen 's tim wiese , and manuel neuer of schalke .
in getting the start in munich , adler was thought to have won the part .
but the 25-year-old did n't play well on wednesday , and loew may reconsider .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adler did n't get to the ball in time adler misjudged his own speed in failing to get to a long ball - a mistake that cost germany a goal .
and his sloppiness was nearly cause for another , after juan sebastian veron 's chip following the keeper 's poor clearance just barely missed the net .
moreover , the quiet adler does n't fit the mold of so many of his predecessors in the german goal - keepers with commanding personalities who were unafraid to shout their back lines into place .
if adler 's bundesliga form dips in any significant way , jogi loew may turn to neuer or wiese - both of whom have more naturally imposing presences .
defense it would be unfair to lay the responsibility for germany 's defensive frailty at adler 's doorstep , however .
the back line is another cause for concern .
barring injury , per mertesacker of werder bremen and bayern munich 's philipp lahm are as good as picked for the first team .
beyond that , everything is up in the air .
mertersacker 's old partner in the center of defense , christoph metzelder , ca n't get a game for real madrid and is out of the picture .
arne friedrich , who can play in the center or on the wing , has seen his form dip almost as badly his club hertha berlin 's , rooted in last place in the bundesliga .
the similarly flexible heiko westermann of schalke is still working his way back from an injury and will have to hope to recover his best form before the tournament .
perhaps most worrisome is the lack of a breakthrough first-team candidate among the newer members of the squad .
jerome boateng would seem to be the furthest along , having coped well enough in his third start on wednesday , but he still has n't reproduced for germany the form he 's shown for hamburg in the bundesliga .
stuttgart 's serdar tasci , however , did himself few favors in munich .
he was juked by angel di maria , thereby giving up a dangerous shot , and failed to coordinate well with his partner per mertesacker .
bildunterschrift : mertesacker , second from left , could use some help further options , however , are few .
a little over a year ago , when wolfsburg and hoffenheim were still flying high , not many would have doubted that marcel schaefer and andreas beck would be in germany 's squad for south africa .
but each now seems questionable , and will likely play only a bit part if brought along for the trip .
midfield the talent is there for germany in the middle of the park - the problem is how to deploy it .
wednesday 's attempt to use michael ballack and bastian schweinsteiger as complementary holding midfielders did n't really catch fire .
both players did a lot of running and tackling , so much so that they forgot to turn sufficient attention to building play while germany was in possession .
this might simply have been overcompensation - the clear division of labor that used to guide germany 's midfield when ballack was paired with torsten frings is no more and each erred on the side of caution , concentrating on defense .
both ballack and schweinsteiger do like to get forward , and both have the field vision and eye for goal to be effective when doing it , provided they have a partner to cover them .
they just need time to establish that rapport - time which is running short .
on the wings and further forward in midfield , germany is blessed with a wealth of options .
younger guys like thomas müller -lrb- bayern -rrb- , toni kroos -lrb- leverkusen -rrb- , and marko marin -lrb- bremen -rrb- have become impact players in the bundesliga this season , and the more experienced aaron hunt -lrb- bremen -rrb- and marcell jansen -lrb- hamburg -rrb- are in as good form as they have ever been .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 04.03.2010 germany falls to maradona 's argentinians großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rene adler arrived too late to prevent the game 's only goal germany 's national soccer team suffered a disappointing defeat to argentina on wednesday evening .
a first-half strike by gonzalo higuain was enough to secure a 1-0 victory over jogi loew 's hapless men . gonzalo higuain clipped a neat goal over the onrushing german goalkeeper rene adler to give diego maradona 's argentina an away win to a lackluster germany in munich 's allianz stadium .
germany was arguably maradona 's biggest scalp so far in his short career as argentina 's national coach , and the world cup legend made clear afterwards how seriously he had taken the challenge .
" we needed to show ourselves we could do what we did today , " maradona said in the post-match press conference .
" we wanted to show against a good team that we are alive and we understand the moment of the argentine national team , which has not won the world cup for 24 years . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona claimed his first high-profile scalp in munich reporters could not help but be reminded of the two famous world cup finals , both featuring maradona , germany and argentina fought out in 1986 and 1990 .
adler 's howler the goal that decided wednesday 's friendly came after rene adler 's ill-advised decision to come out for a long ball knocked hopefully into the german half .
real madrid striker higuain , often overlooked by maradona and his predecessor alfio basile , beat adler to the ball by what the keeper later ruefully described as " that famous half-meter " and slotted home the finish .
throughout the rest of an edgy , tactical game , the german defence often resorted to rough-arm tactics to stop argentina 's star attackers lionel messi and angel di maria , though there was nothing they could do to stop a brilliant effort by the benfica player .
collecting veron 's pass about 25 metres from goal , di maria slipped his marker , thumped his shot against the crossbar and appeared to be smacked in the face by a defender immediately afterwards .
argentina dominate veron tried an even more spectacular effort early in the second half when adler failed to clear the ball properly and the estudiantes player lobbed the goalkeeper from about 40 meters only to see his effort just miss the target .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the friendly was one of the last warm-up games before the world cup germany came to life after cacau replaced the ineffective mesut oezil in the 67th minute , but while the brazilian-born forward tested argentinian keeper sergio romero with a powerful drive , he could do nothing to avert germany 's defeat , which marked the third game without a win for jogi loew 's men .
the frustrated german crowd watched most of the world cup warm-up match in silence , while argentinian supporters cheered as the south american powerhouses stroked the ball around in the dying minutes and greeted the final whistle with a resounding chorus of jeers .
" our mistake was not to take more risks up front , " concluded germany captain michael ballack after the game . according to fifa 's latest world rankings , germany is number five - four places above argentina at nine , one behind england .

these would be " the most nationally-focused local elections ever , " the leftist volkskrant newspaper said as pollsters predicted a tough ride for the two biggest parties - the christian democratic appeal -lrb- cda -rrb- and the labor party -lrb- pvda -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : balkenende 's cabinet collapsed in february rising tide the toughest challenge came from geert wilders ' far-right party for freedom -lrb- pvv -rrb- party , set up in 2006 to " stop the islamization of the netherlands . "
the pvv contested only two cities in its first municipal election , three months ahead of early general elections on june 9 .
the pvv holds nine seats in the 150-seat lower house of parliament .
" we 're going to take the netherlands back from the leftist elite that coddles criminals and supports islamization , " freedom party leader geert wilders said early thursday .
wilders ' party came in second in the european elections of june last year , with 16.7 percent of the vote , behind the christian democrats of outgoing premier jan peter balkenende .
according to the results from 96 of the 98 polling stations , the pvv finished substantially ahead of the pvda in almere , with 21.6 percent of the vote .
the pvda , winners of the previous elections in 2006 , got 17.6 percent .
" what is possible in the hague and almere is possible all over the country .
it 's a springboard for our victory , " wilders told his supporters in almere .
gains in the heart of holland in the hague , the country 's political capital , the pvv came in second behind the pvda , though complete results were not yet available .
most polls had predicted the pvv would come in first in almere , a city of 187,000 inhabitants east of the capital amsterdam , and second or third in the hague - the netherlands ' third largest city with 442,000 residents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister wouter bos withdrew his party from the coalition the results indicated that both the centrist parties were struggling ahead of national elections brought forward to june 9 ; the big winner being wilders ' pvv , now thought to be the country 's most popular political party .
some 12 million dutch out of a total 16.5 million were registered to vote in 394 municipalities for nearly 9,000 councillors countrywide .
capitalizing on broken coalition pvda leader wouter bos withdrew his party from the national government last month in a spat with balkenende 's cda over extending the dutch military mission in afghanistan .
the cda won 41 seats out of 150 in parliament in the previous round of national elections , the pvda 33 and the pvv nine .
wilders is awaiting trial for alleged hate speech against muslims for having likened the koran to hitler 's " mein kampf " and calling islam a fascist religion .
in 2006 municipal elections , the pvda came out on top with 23.45 percent of the vote nationally , ahead of the cda which got 16.83 percent .
final results of this year 's municipal elections will be released on friday. bk / ape / afp editor : rick demarest send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hungarian-born is recognized with this year 's chamisso prize for non-native german authors . it is a freezing cold afternoon in berlin .
outside , people are trudging through the snow with shopping bags ; others are hurrying to crowded trams .
terezia mora is taking refuge in a small courtyard movie theater .
the window panes are fogged up and the interior is glaringly empty . to lose herself in a film , to have the whole screen for herself while everyone else is working , to disappear in a hectic rush - for terezia mora , this is a pleasant distraction from writing .
and it reminds her of the 1990s , when she left hungary at the age of 19 to study in germany . " i went to the movies almost seven times a week because that 's what i had missed the most in my little home village , " explained mora .
" here in berlin i could really feel free . "
bleak no-man 's land terezia mora was born in hungary and her family belonged to the country 's german minority .
for her , being in berlin shortly after the fall of the berlin wall was a form of liberation - away from a strict communist society , submerged in an unfinished city open to experiments .
she began to study screenwriting - probably a reason why many of her later stories have a cinematic verve to them and contain precise dialogue . she wrote her first literary text in german and gave a reading at a public event , more out of curiosity than anything else .
soon after that she received a contract with a renowned publishing company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the only man on the continent " wants to escape his reality she named her book of short stories " seltsame materie " -lrb- " strange material " -rrb- - a collection of raw , somber tales from her own childhood .

often she writes from the perspective of strange male characters . " if i were to write about women , i would reveal more about myself than i want to , " said the author . lost in the net a recurring theme in mora 's books is communication - people who are linguistically uprooted and can not find emotional stability .
in her debut novel " day in day out " she tells the story of a balkan refugee in western europe , a brilliant man who speaks 10 languages but somehow can not make himself understood in any of them . her last novel " the only man on the continent " describes a week in the life of an overweight computer nerd , darius kopp .
he works for an international company , but then the collapsing global economy affects his job , leaving him insecure and depressed - a man with no control over his feelings or his finances . through his character , mora wanted to depict " someone who flees to this artificial internet world , " which is " both tragic and comical .

xavier naidoo , beyonce , and depeche mode are among the nominees for the 2010 echo awards .
the prestigious prizes honoring the year 's best pop and rock music will be awarded in berlin on thursday . it 's the most anticipated evening in german pop music : the echo awards for rock and pop will be presented in berlin on thursday evening .
nominees include lady gaga , david guetta , and the black eyed peas as well as german bands silbermond and ich + ich . as the german equivalent of the grammys or the brit pop awards , the echo awards differ from their anglophile counterparts in one critical way : the echos give nearly equal focus to german and international artists . nominations are divided into ' domestic ' and ' international ' categories .
daniel knoell of the german music industry association told deutsche welle that the international focus of the awards is highlighted by the diverse performances lined up for thursday 's ceremony .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scorpions performed at last year 's echo awards .
" we have international stars like rihanna or robbie williams , who will perform in english , and we have artists like peter maffay , who will present his songs in german , " knoell said . in addition to the usual categories of " best artist " , and " best band , " the echo awards also feature nominations for the best german folk music and best german " schlager " singer . sold-out show this year 's echo event is noticeably smaller than last year 's , which boasted a record audience of 10,000 fans in the o2 arena in berlin .
but the tickets for the 2010 echos awards , which will be held at a smaller venue with space for about 4,000 guests , were still a hot commodity .
this year 's tickets sold out in seven minutes , according to organizers . founded in 1992 by the deutsche phono-akademie - the cultural institute of the association of the german music industry , the echo is one of the most important european music prizes . author : sarah harman editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

how are experts in asia reacting to this possible shift in us nuclear policy ? it has been nearly a year since us president barack obama unveiled his vision for a nuclear free world .
in a speech in the czech capital prague last april , he claimed america was committed ' to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons ' .
now his vision seems to be taking shape .
the new us nuclear policy review is expected to be announced in the next few weeks .
and as media reports suggest , the obama administration is likely to reduce its nuclear stockpile drastically and boost its conventional weapons capabilities .
the move will attract a lot of attention in asia , says commodore uday bhaskar , a security analyst in india .
" my sense is that the countries like india are looking at it with a lot of interest because these are objectives that india has been supporting and espousing for many decades and there has not been any serious international effort towards this end for many years . "
role of bigger nuclear powers despite india 's traditional stand on nuclear disarmament , it conducted nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998 and declared that it possessed nuclear capability .
its neighbor pakistan acquired nuclear weapons as well , stressing it needed them for defense against neighbors particularly india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a site of india ’ s nuclear test in 1998 neither country has signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty and experts doubt if they will ever give up their nuclear weapons as long as their relations remain strained .
moreover there is a school of thought that believes that the initiative to eliminate nuclear weapons should come from bigger nuclear powers .
" there are some 23,000 weapons all over the world .
out of this 22,000 are shared between us and russia , " says retired gen. talat masood , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the remaining one thousand are with other countries .
so i do n't think anyone should expect any change among other nuclear powers .
the lead has to come from us , russia , and then followed by other permanent un members and india , pakistan and israel . "
china 's dilemma china , on the other hand , has long maintained that it opposes nuclear proliferation and that its nuclear strategy is purely for self defense .
but its substantial increases in military budgets in recent years have sent signals that it wants to surpass the us as the world 's top military power .
oliver thränert , an expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , explains : " china thinks that the overwhelming superiority of the us in terms of its conventional weaponry means that a world without nuclear weapons would be a world in which the dominance of the us would be even clearer than now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea ’ s nuclear facilities at yongbyon north korea nuclear issue the idea of global nuclear disarmament has got considerable support in the northeast asia though , particularly in japan , the only country to have suffered nuclear bombardment .
the hatoyama government is seeking to denuclearize northeast asia as one of its top priorities , says key-young son an expert on international affairs in japan .
he says any signs from the us towards denuclearization will also give a fresh push to the six party talks on north korea 's nuclear program that have remain stalled for the last few years and which aim at paving the way for a nuclear free korean peninsula : " one of the reasons why north korea is hesitating to take steps forward is that the north korean government does n't believe in any intentions of the obama administration , " says key-young son .
" if the obama administration is moving to build trust in terms of nuclear issues , i think it will obviously help in the restart of nuclear talks and also it might change the attitude of north korea in a more positive direction in the near future . "
during his prague speech , obama admitted that the goal of a nuclear free world would not be reached quickly .
experts say lessons could be learned from the earlier disarmament efforts such as the chemical weapons convention which came into force in 1997 after many long years of negotiation .

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .

how are experts in asia reacting to this possible shift in us nuclear policy ? it has been nearly a year since us president barack obama unveiled his vision for a nuclear free world .
in a speech in the czech capital prague last april , he claimed america was committed ' to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons ' .
now his vision seems to be taking shape .
the new us nuclear policy review is expected to be announced in the next few weeks .
and as media reports suggest , the obama administration is likely to reduce its nuclear stockpile drastically and boost its conventional weapons capabilities .
the move will attract a lot of attention in asia , says commodore uday bhaskar , a security analyst in india .
" my sense is that the countries like india are looking at it with a lot of interest because these are objectives that india has been supporting and espousing for many decades and there has not been any serious international effort towards this end for many years . "
role of bigger nuclear powers despite india 's traditional stand on nuclear disarmament , it conducted nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998 and declared that it possessed nuclear capability .
its neighbor pakistan acquired nuclear weapons as well , stressing it needed them for defense against neighbors particularly india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a site of india ’ s nuclear test in 1998 neither country has signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty and experts doubt if they will ever give up their nuclear weapons as long as their relations remain strained .
moreover there is a school of thought that believes that the initiative to eliminate nuclear weapons should come from bigger nuclear powers .
" there are some 23,000 weapons all over the world .
out of this 22,000 are shared between us and russia , " says retired gen. talat masood , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the remaining one thousand are with other countries .
so i do n't think anyone should expect any change among other nuclear powers .
the lead has to come from us , russia , and then followed by other permanent un members and india , pakistan and israel . "
china 's dilemma china , on the other hand , has long maintained that it opposes nuclear proliferation and that its nuclear strategy is purely for self defense .
but its substantial increases in military budgets in recent years have sent signals that it wants to surpass the us as the world 's top military power .
oliver thränert , an expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , explains : " china thinks that the overwhelming superiority of the us in terms of its conventional weaponry means that a world without nuclear weapons would be a world in which the dominance of the us would be even clearer than now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea ’ s nuclear facilities at yongbyon north korea nuclear issue the idea of global nuclear disarmament has got considerable support in the northeast asia though , particularly in japan , the only country to have suffered nuclear bombardment .
the hatoyama government is seeking to denuclearize northeast asia as one of its top priorities , says key-young son an expert on international affairs in japan .
he says any signs from the us towards denuclearization will also give a fresh push to the six party talks on north korea 's nuclear program that have remain stalled for the last few years and which aim at paving the way for a nuclear free korean peninsula : " one of the reasons why north korea is hesitating to take steps forward is that the north korean government does n't believe in any intentions of the obama administration , " says key-young son .
" if the obama administration is moving to build trust in terms of nuclear issues , i think it will obviously help in the restart of nuclear talks and also it might change the attitude of north korea in a more positive direction in the near future . "
during his prague speech , obama admitted that the goal of a nuclear free world would not be reached quickly .
experts say lessons could be learned from the earlier disarmament efforts such as the chemical weapons convention which came into force in 1997 after many long years of negotiation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 04.03.2010 eu should drop failed sanctions policy against burma , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu sanctions have failed to win the release of burmese opposition leader aung san suu kyi while the eu announced a humanitarian aid package for burma this week , it left in place its 14-year old sanctions regime against the country .
experts say misguided sanctions are the wrong approach and counterproductive . on tuesday , the european union pledged to provide 17.3 million euros -lrb- $ 23.4 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid this year to burma .
most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .
while the eu aid package may provide much needed short-term help for burma , also know as myanmar , which ranks 138th out of 182 nations in the united nation 's human development index , it does n't address the most critical issue in europe 's dealings with the country , say experts .
since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "

experts say misguided sanctions are the wrong approach and counterproductive . on tuesday , the european union pledged to provide 17.3 million euros -lrb- $ 23.4 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid this year to burma .
most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .
while the eu aid package may provide much needed short-term help for burma , also know as myanmar , which ranks 138th out of 182 nations in the united nation 's human development index , it does n't address the most critical issue in europe 's dealings with the country , say experts .
since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "

as brussels painstakingly deliberates the merits of aspiring european union members in the balkans , beijing has begun an investment offensive in the region .
but is china ’ s money talking economics or politics ? last year , presidents hu jintao of china and boris tadic of serbia cemented their bilateral relations and traditional friendship with a strategic partnership .
besides reaffirming their mutual respect for one another 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , pledging broader , stronger and deeper ties , the two republics firmly stated their aim to promote economic cooperation and trade .
a document resulting from their partnership agreement said the two sides had expressed a readiness to “ ensure continuous and steady growth of bilateral trade and gradually improve the balance of bilateral trade through development in accordance with the principle of equality , mutual benefit , reciprocity and win-win result . ”
a few months down the line the export import bank of china -lrb- china eximbank -rrb- has granted belgrade a billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- loan to upgrade two power plants and build a much-needed bridge over the beautiful blue danube .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bridge would help unclog belgrade 's traffic the bridge project , which is due to get underway in the spring , is critical both as a means of easing the traffic situation in belgrade , and as a test of how well china can work with its south-eastern european partner .
an official from the cabinet of serbia 's national investment plan -lrb- nip -rrb- , who preferred not to be named , told deutsche welle that continued chinese presence in the region hinges on the success of the bridge scheme . " there are a lot of projects we would like the chinese to do , " he said .
" but they want to see how it turns out first . "
what 's good for one … and serbia is not the only country in the balkans which embraces the idea of a free-flowing yuan .
dusan reljic from the eu external relations division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that chinese presence is gathering momentum right across the region .
" the chinese are in slovenia , in macedonia , they 're exporting buses to skopje , they 're talking to croatia about transport facilities , harbors , airports , railway connections , " he said " and they 've been talking to the greeks about leasing possibilities in athens harbor . "
analysts have described china 's arrival in the balkans as an effort to get into europe through the back door .
but kerry brown of the asia program at london 's chatham house , disputes the need for sneaking in through the rear when the " front door is wide open . "
citing telecommunications and automotive high-tech retail industries as examples , he told deutsche welle that chinese investors are already in europe .
win-win result ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pireus harbor in athens dusan reljic agrees , but says taking the direct route to greater eu presence would be more costly for china than investing in territories poised to join within the next 10 to 15 years .
" it 's cheaper to buy assets there -lsb- southern-eastern europe -rsb- than within the present european union , " the expert said .
a cheap ride for china , but what 's in it for the conduit countries like serbia ?
" a good deal , " says reljic .
with very little direct foreign investment coming into the region , tight government budgets and unemployment rates on the rise again , he says balkan states need and welcome china 's money , which comes with grace periods , generously low interest rates and very few strings attached .
" the chinese do not attach economic or political conditions to their loans , " reljic said .
" in a way , cheap chinese money is an alternative to commercially expensive western money or politically expensive money from the international monetary fund or the world bank . "
the politics of economics but money is not the only factor at play .
reljic says beijing 's activities in the balkans are as much about political positioning as they are about financial returns .
" this increased presence is also a signal to the us and the west that china is no longer a peripheral world power , but it is the world power and it is engaging in all political developments throughout the world with its own agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kosovo is serbia " graffiti is testimony to kosovo 's disputed independence an example of that agenda is beijing 's vehement opposition to kosovo 's independence .
china recently spoke out against kosovo 's split from serbia at the international court of justice in the hague .
yet many analysts would say such public displays of support have less to do with china 's concern over stability in the balkans region than with a concern that its own minority groups might follow kosovo 's lead towards independence .
and that , says kerry brown is " absolutely not what they want . "
weighing it up so what do they want ?
" china wants to remake the world and is disappointed that the world wo n't comply . "
brown said .
" it is guided by self-interest and is happy to abuse friendships . "
he says china , which has itself stated its national aim of becoming a strong and wealthy country , is often hard for foreign partners to understand , which is why smaller countries like those in the balkans should be aware of what they want from a partnership with beijing .
" if countries say yes to everything , they have the complication of becoming a tributary state of china . "
but the nip official told deutsche welle such problems would not arise between belgrade and beijing .
" according to domestic law , we are obliged to hire third-party supervision , " he said .
" the chinese will not be given free reign to do whatever they want , no matter who they are dealing with . "

as brussels painstakingly deliberates the merits of aspiring european union members in the balkans , beijing has begun an investment offensive in the region .
but is china ’ s money talking economics or politics ? last year , presidents hu jintao of china and boris tadic of serbia cemented their bilateral relations and traditional friendship with a strategic partnership .
besides reaffirming their mutual respect for one another 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , pledging broader , stronger and deeper ties , the two republics firmly stated their aim to promote economic cooperation and trade .
a document resulting from their partnership agreement said the two sides had expressed a readiness to “ ensure continuous and steady growth of bilateral trade and gradually improve the balance of bilateral trade through development in accordance with the principle of equality , mutual benefit , reciprocity and win-win result . ”
a few months down the line the export import bank of china -lrb- china eximbank -rrb- has granted belgrade a billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- loan to upgrade two power plants and build a much-needed bridge over the beautiful blue danube .

what 's good for one … and serbia is not the only country in the balkans which embraces the idea of a free-flowing yuan .
dusan reljic from the eu external relations division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that chinese presence is gathering momentum right across the region .
" the chinese are in slovenia , in macedonia , they 're exporting buses to skopje , they 're talking to croatia about transport facilities , harbors , airports , railway connections , " he said " and they 've been talking to the greeks about leasing possibilities in athens harbor . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pireus harbor in athens dusan reljic agrees , but says taking the direct route to greater eu presence would be more costly for china than investing in territories poised to join within the next 10 to 15 years .

with very little direct foreign investment coming into the region , tight government budgets and unemployment rates on the rise again , he says balkan states need and welcome china 's money , which comes with grace periods , generously low interest rates and very few strings attached .

reljic says beijing 's activities in the balkans are as much about political positioning as they are about financial returns .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kosovo is serbia " graffiti is testimony to kosovo 's disputed independence an example of that agenda is beijing 's vehement opposition to kosovo 's independence .

the hungarian-born is recognized with this year 's chamisso prize for non-native german authors . it is a freezing cold afternoon in berlin .

terezia mora is taking refuge in a small courtyard movie theater .

how are experts in asia reacting to this possible shift in us nuclear policy ? it has been nearly a year since us president barack obama unveiled his vision for a nuclear free world .
in a speech in the czech capital prague last april , he claimed america was committed ' to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons ' .
now his vision seems to be taking shape .
the new us nuclear policy review is expected to be announced in the next few weeks .
and as media reports suggest , the obama administration is likely to reduce its nuclear stockpile drastically and boost its conventional weapons capabilities .
the move will attract a lot of attention in asia , says commodore uday bhaskar , a security analyst in india .
" my sense is that the countries like india are looking at it with a lot of interest because these are objectives that india has been supporting and espousing for many decades and there has not been any serious international effort towards this end for many years . "
role of bigger nuclear powers despite india 's traditional stand on nuclear disarmament , it conducted nuclear tests in 1974 and 1998 and declared that it possessed nuclear capability .
its neighbor pakistan acquired nuclear weapons as well , stressing it needed them for defense against neighbors particularly india .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a site of india ’ s nuclear test in 1998 neither country has signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty and experts doubt if they will ever give up their nuclear weapons as long as their relations remain strained .
moreover there is a school of thought that believes that the initiative to eliminate nuclear weapons should come from bigger nuclear powers .
" there are some 23,000 weapons all over the world .
out of this 22,000 are shared between us and russia , " says retired gen. talat masood , a security analyst in islamabad .
" the remaining one thousand are with other countries .
so i do n't think anyone should expect any change among other nuclear powers .
the lead has to come from us , russia , and then followed by other permanent un members and india , pakistan and israel . "
china 's dilemma china , on the other hand , has long maintained that it opposes nuclear proliferation and that its nuclear strategy is purely for self defense .
but its substantial increases in military budgets in recent years have sent signals that it wants to surpass the us as the world 's top military power .
oliver thränert , an expert at the german institute for international and security affairs , explains : " china thinks that the overwhelming superiority of the us in terms of its conventional weaponry means that a world without nuclear weapons would be a world in which the dominance of the us would be even clearer than now . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : north korea ’ s nuclear facilities at yongbyon north korea nuclear issue the idea of global nuclear disarmament has got considerable support in the northeast asia though , particularly in japan , the only country to have suffered nuclear bombardment .
the hatoyama government is seeking to denuclearize northeast asia as one of its top priorities , says key-young son an expert on international affairs in japan .
he says any signs from the us towards denuclearization will also give a fresh push to the six party talks on north korea 's nuclear program that have remain stalled for the last few years and which aim at paving the way for a nuclear free korean peninsula : " one of the reasons why north korea is hesitating to take steps forward is that the north korean government does n't believe in any intentions of the obama administration , " says key-young son .
" if the obama administration is moving to build trust in terms of nuclear issues , i think it will obviously help in the restart of nuclear talks and also it might change the attitude of north korea in a more positive direction in the near future . "
during his prague speech , obama admitted that the goal of a nuclear free world would not be reached quickly .
experts say lessons could be learned from the earlier disarmament efforts such as the chemical weapons convention which came into force in 1997 after many long years of negotiation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 04.03.2010 eu should drop failed sanctions policy against burma , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu sanctions have failed to win the release of burmese opposition leader aung san suu kyi while the eu announced a humanitarian aid package for burma this week , it left in place its 14-year old sanctions regime against the country .
experts say misguided sanctions are the wrong approach and counterproductive . on tuesday , the european union pledged to provide 17.3 million euros -lrb- $ 23.4 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid this year to burma .
most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .
while the eu aid package may provide much needed short-term help for burma , also know as myanmar , which ranks 138th out of 182 nations in the united nation 's human development index , it does n't address the most critical issue in europe 's dealings with the country , say experts .
since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "
bildunterschrift : the military rules with an iron fist over burma while the eu and the us have slapped sanctions against burma , most other countries have not , making it easy for the regime to circumvent the sanctions by dealing with other nations . " myanmar is ravaged by chinese businesses that extract natural resources , " says swanström .
" we have no possibility to influence that , so in a sense we lose every possibility to have an impact . "
counterproductive measures what 's more , says michael von hauff , an economist and burma expert at the university of kaiserslautern , the sanctions are not just ineffective , they are actually counterproductive and hurt not the ruling clique , but the burmese people .
" the living conditions of the people have deteriorated and for example many young women in the textile sector lost their jobs , " he told deutsche welle . recent events tend to underscore the experts ' perception that the junta 's demeanor and stance has not been altered by the sanctions regime .
last month , an american citizen and human rights activist was sentenced to five years in prison for forging an identity card .
shortly thereafter , four other human rights activists were sentenced to prison terms on the day of the arrival of the un 's human rights envoy .
during his five day-trip , un envoy tomas ojea quintana was n't allowed to visit aung san suu kyi .
instead of sanctions , the eu should try to engage in a dialogue with the regime .
this dialogue policy should n't focus primarily on the junta leaders , but rather on mid-level government officials , says von hauff .
he has been travelling to burma regularly since 2001 to hold seminars and made an important observation : " it was really interesting that most of the people from the ministries were very open .
we could discuss all the problems and also the human rights situation .
so we should have a differentiated picture of the country . "
push from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : childen suffer especially from the dismal economic situation in burma but in order to engage the government effectively , the eu must first drop its current failed sanctions policy , argue von hauff and swanström .
only than can it regain any possible leverage on the junta , which it lost through the sanctions .
whether and when that could happen neither of the experts venture to say .
the push to change the eu 's policy toward burma could come once again from the us .
washington has recently sent some signals that it is rethinking its sanctions regime . should washington decide to change its policy , the eu would probably do so as well , says von hauff .
" i have the feeling that we have the sanctions because the united states has sanctions and so the eu has to have sanctions as well . "

as brussels painstakingly deliberates the merits of aspiring european union members in the balkans , beijing has begun an investment offensive in the region .
but is china ’ s money talking economics or politics ? last year , presidents hu jintao of china and boris tadic of serbia cemented their bilateral relations and traditional friendship with a strategic partnership .
besides reaffirming their mutual respect for one another 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , pledging broader , stronger and deeper ties , the two republics firmly stated their aim to promote economic cooperation and trade .
a document resulting from their partnership agreement said the two sides had expressed a readiness to “ ensure continuous and steady growth of bilateral trade and gradually improve the balance of bilateral trade through development in accordance with the principle of equality , mutual benefit , reciprocity and win-win result . ”
a few months down the line the export import bank of china -lrb- china eximbank -rrb- has granted belgrade a billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- loan to upgrade two power plants and build a much-needed bridge over the beautiful blue danube .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bridge would help unclog belgrade 's traffic the bridge project , which is due to get underway in the spring , is critical both as a means of easing the traffic situation in belgrade , and as a test of how well china can work with its south-eastern european partner .
an official from the cabinet of serbia 's national investment plan -lrb- nip -rrb- , who preferred not to be named , told deutsche welle that continued chinese presence in the region hinges on the success of the bridge scheme . " there are a lot of projects we would like the chinese to do , " he said .
" but they want to see how it turns out first . "
what 's good for one … and serbia is not the only country in the balkans which embraces the idea of a free-flowing yuan .
dusan reljic from the eu external relations division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that chinese presence is gathering momentum right across the region .
" the chinese are in slovenia , in macedonia , they 're exporting buses to skopje , they 're talking to croatia about transport facilities , harbors , airports , railway connections , " he said " and they 've been talking to the greeks about leasing possibilities in athens harbor . "
analysts have described china 's arrival in the balkans as an effort to get into europe through the back door .
but kerry brown of the asia program at london 's chatham house , disputes the need for sneaking in through the rear when the " front door is wide open . "
citing telecommunications and automotive high-tech retail industries as examples , he told deutsche welle that chinese investors are already in europe .
win-win result ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pireus harbor in athens dusan reljic agrees , but says taking the direct route to greater eu presence would be more costly for china than investing in territories poised to join within the next 10 to 15 years .
" it 's cheaper to buy assets there -lsb- southern-eastern europe -rsb- than within the present european union , " the expert said .
a cheap ride for china , but what 's in it for the conduit countries like serbia ?
" a good deal , " says reljic .
with very little direct foreign investment coming into the region , tight government budgets and unemployment rates on the rise again , he says balkan states need and welcome china 's money , which comes with grace periods , generously low interest rates and very few strings attached .
" the chinese do not attach economic or political conditions to their loans , " reljic said .
" in a way , cheap chinese money is an alternative to commercially expensive western money or politically expensive money from the international monetary fund or the world bank . "
the politics of economics but money is not the only factor at play .
reljic says beijing 's activities in the balkans are as much about political positioning as they are about financial returns .
" this increased presence is also a signal to the us and the west that china is no longer a peripheral world power , but it is the world power and it is engaging in all political developments throughout the world with its own agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kosovo is serbia " graffiti is testimony to kosovo 's disputed independence an example of that agenda is beijing 's vehement opposition to kosovo 's independence .
china recently spoke out against kosovo 's split from serbia at the international court of justice in the hague .
yet many analysts would say such public displays of support have less to do with china 's concern over stability in the balkans region than with a concern that its own minority groups might follow kosovo 's lead towards independence .
and that , says kerry brown is " absolutely not what they want . "
weighing it up so what do they want ?
" china wants to remake the world and is disappointed that the world wo n't comply . "
brown said .
" it is guided by self-interest and is happy to abuse friendships . "
he says china , which has itself stated its national aim of becoming a strong and wealthy country , is often hard for foreign partners to understand , which is why smaller countries like those in the balkans should be aware of what they want from a partnership with beijing .
" if countries say yes to everything , they have the complication of becoming a tributary state of china . "
but the nip official told deutsche welle such problems would not arise between belgrade and beijing .
" according to domestic law , we are obliged to hire third-party supervision , " he said .
" the chinese will not be given free reign to do whatever they want , no matter who they are dealing with . "

experts say misguided sanctions are the wrong approach and counterproductive . on tuesday , the european union pledged to provide 17.3 million euros -lrb- $ 23.4 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid this year to burma .
most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .
while the eu aid package may provide much needed short-term help for burma , also know as myanmar , which ranks 138th out of 182 nations in the united nation 's human development index , it does n't address the most critical issue in europe 's dealings with the country , say experts .
since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "
bildunterschrift : the military rules with an iron fist over burma while the eu and the us have slapped sanctions against burma , most other countries have not , making it easy for the regime to circumvent the sanctions by dealing with other nations . " myanmar is ravaged by chinese businesses that extract natural resources , " says swanström .
" we have no possibility to influence that , so in a sense we lose every possibility to have an impact . "
counterproductive measures what 's more , says michael von hauff , an economist and burma expert at the university of kaiserslautern , the sanctions are not just ineffective , they are actually counterproductive and hurt not the ruling clique , but the burmese people .
" the living conditions of the people have deteriorated and for example many young women in the textile sector lost their jobs , " he told deutsche welle . recent events tend to underscore the experts ' perception that the junta 's demeanor and stance has not been altered by the sanctions regime .
last month , an american citizen and human rights activist was sentenced to five years in prison for forging an identity card .
shortly thereafter , four other human rights activists were sentenced to prison terms on the day of the arrival of the un 's human rights envoy .
during his five day-trip , un envoy tomas ojea quintana was n't allowed to visit aung san suu kyi .
instead of sanctions , the eu should try to engage in a dialogue with the regime .
this dialogue policy should n't focus primarily on the junta leaders , but rather on mid-level government officials , says von hauff .
he has been travelling to burma regularly since 2001 to hold seminars and made an important observation : " it was really interesting that most of the people from the ministries were very open .
we could discuss all the problems and also the human rights situation .
so we should have a differentiated picture of the country . "
push from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : childen suffer especially from the dismal economic situation in burma but in order to engage the government effectively , the eu must first drop its current failed sanctions policy , argue von hauff and swanström .
only than can it regain any possible leverage on the junta , which it lost through the sanctions .
whether and when that could happen neither of the experts venture to say .
the push to change the eu 's policy toward burma could come once again from the us .
washington has recently sent some signals that it is rethinking its sanctions regime . should washington decide to change its policy , the eu would probably do so as well , says von hauff .
" i have the feeling that we have the sanctions because the united states has sanctions and so the eu has to have sanctions as well . "

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

as brussels painstakingly deliberates the merits of aspiring european union members in the balkans , beijing has begun an investment offensive in the region .
but is china ’ s money talking economics or politics ? last year , presidents hu jintao of china and boris tadic of serbia cemented their bilateral relations and traditional friendship with a strategic partnership .
besides reaffirming their mutual respect for one another 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , pledging broader , stronger and deeper ties , the two republics firmly stated their aim to promote economic cooperation and trade .
a document resulting from their partnership agreement said the two sides had expressed a readiness to “ ensure continuous and steady growth of bilateral trade and gradually improve the balance of bilateral trade through development in accordance with the principle of equality , mutual benefit , reciprocity and win-win result . ”
a few months down the line the export import bank of china -lrb- china eximbank -rrb- has granted belgrade a billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- loan to upgrade two power plants and build a much-needed bridge over the beautiful blue danube .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new bridge would help unclog belgrade 's traffic the bridge project , which is due to get underway in the spring , is critical both as a means of easing the traffic situation in belgrade , and as a test of how well china can work with its south-eastern european partner .
an official from the cabinet of serbia 's national investment plan -lrb- nip -rrb- , who preferred not to be named , told deutsche welle that continued chinese presence in the region hinges on the success of the bridge scheme . " there are a lot of projects we would like the chinese to do , " he said .
" but they want to see how it turns out first . "
what 's good for one … and serbia is not the only country in the balkans which embraces the idea of a free-flowing yuan .
dusan reljic from the eu external relations division of the german institute for international and security affairs , told deutsche welle that chinese presence is gathering momentum right across the region .
" the chinese are in slovenia , in macedonia , they 're exporting buses to skopje , they 're talking to croatia about transport facilities , harbors , airports , railway connections , " he said " and they 've been talking to the greeks about leasing possibilities in athens harbor . "
analysts have described china 's arrival in the balkans as an effort to get into europe through the back door .
but kerry brown of the asia program at london 's chatham house , disputes the need for sneaking in through the rear when the " front door is wide open . "
citing telecommunications and automotive high-tech retail industries as examples , he told deutsche welle that chinese investors are already in europe .
win-win result ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pireus harbor in athens dusan reljic agrees , but says taking the direct route to greater eu presence would be more costly for china than investing in territories poised to join within the next 10 to 15 years .
" it 's cheaper to buy assets there -lsb- southern-eastern europe -rsb- than within the present european union , " the expert said .
a cheap ride for china , but what 's in it for the conduit countries like serbia ?
" a good deal , " says reljic .
with very little direct foreign investment coming into the region , tight government budgets and unemployment rates on the rise again , he says balkan states need and welcome china 's money , which comes with grace periods , generously low interest rates and very few strings attached .
" the chinese do not attach economic or political conditions to their loans , " reljic said .
" in a way , cheap chinese money is an alternative to commercially expensive western money or politically expensive money from the international monetary fund or the world bank . "
the politics of economics but money is not the only factor at play .
reljic says beijing 's activities in the balkans are as much about political positioning as they are about financial returns .
" this increased presence is also a signal to the us and the west that china is no longer a peripheral world power , but it is the world power and it is engaging in all political developments throughout the world with its own agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kosovo is serbia " graffiti is testimony to kosovo 's disputed independence an example of that agenda is beijing 's vehement opposition to kosovo 's independence .
china recently spoke out against kosovo 's split from serbia at the international court of justice in the hague .
yet many analysts would say such public displays of support have less to do with china 's concern over stability in the balkans region than with a concern that its own minority groups might follow kosovo 's lead towards independence .
and that , says kerry brown is " absolutely not what they want . "
weighing it up so what do they want ?
" china wants to remake the world and is disappointed that the world wo n't comply . "
brown said .
" it is guided by self-interest and is happy to abuse friendships . "
he says china , which has itself stated its national aim of becoming a strong and wealthy country , is often hard for foreign partners to understand , which is why smaller countries like those in the balkans should be aware of what they want from a partnership with beijing .
" if countries say yes to everything , they have the complication of becoming a tributary state of china . "
but the nip official told deutsche welle such problems would not arise between belgrade and beijing .
" according to domestic law , we are obliged to hire third-party supervision , " he said .
" the chinese will not be given free reign to do whatever they want , no matter who they are dealing with . "

experts say misguided sanctions are the wrong approach and counterproductive . on tuesday , the european union pledged to provide 17.3 million euros -lrb- $ 23.4 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid this year to burma .
most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .
while the eu aid package may provide much needed short-term help for burma , also know as myanmar , which ranks 138th out of 182 nations in the united nation 's human development index , it does n't address the most critical issue in europe 's dealings with the country , say experts .
since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "
bildunterschrift : the military rules with an iron fist over burma while the eu and the us have slapped sanctions against burma , most other countries have not , making it easy for the regime to circumvent the sanctions by dealing with other nations . " myanmar is ravaged by chinese businesses that extract natural resources , " says swanström .
" we have no possibility to influence that , so in a sense we lose every possibility to have an impact . "
counterproductive measures what 's more , says michael von hauff , an economist and burma expert at the university of kaiserslautern , the sanctions are not just ineffective , they are actually counterproductive and hurt not the ruling clique , but the burmese people .
" the living conditions of the people have deteriorated and for example many young women in the textile sector lost their jobs , " he told deutsche welle . recent events tend to underscore the experts ' perception that the junta 's demeanor and stance has not been altered by the sanctions regime .
last month , an american citizen and human rights activist was sentenced to five years in prison for forging an identity card .
shortly thereafter , four other human rights activists were sentenced to prison terms on the day of the arrival of the un 's human rights envoy .
during his five day-trip , un envoy tomas ojea quintana was n't allowed to visit aung san suu kyi .
instead of sanctions , the eu should try to engage in a dialogue with the regime .
this dialogue policy should n't focus primarily on the junta leaders , but rather on mid-level government officials , says von hauff .
he has been travelling to burma regularly since 2001 to hold seminars and made an important observation : " it was really interesting that most of the people from the ministries were very open .
we could discuss all the problems and also the human rights situation .
so we should have a differentiated picture of the country . "
push from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : childen suffer especially from the dismal economic situation in burma but in order to engage the government effectively , the eu must first drop its current failed sanctions policy , argue von hauff and swanström .
only than can it regain any possible leverage on the junta , which it lost through the sanctions .
whether and when that could happen neither of the experts venture to say .
the push to change the eu 's policy toward burma could come once again from the us .
washington has recently sent some signals that it is rethinking its sanctions regime . should washington decide to change its policy , the eu would probably do so as well , says von hauff .
" i have the feeling that we have the sanctions because the united states has sanctions and so the eu has to have sanctions as well . "

as brussels painstakingly deliberates the merits of aspiring european union members in the balkans , beijing has begun an investment offensive in the region .
but is china ’ s money talking economics or politics ? last year , presidents hu jintao of china and boris tadic of serbia cemented their bilateral relations and traditional friendship with a strategic partnership .
besides reaffirming their mutual respect for one another 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , pledging broader , stronger and deeper ties , the two republics firmly stated their aim to promote economic cooperation and trade .
a document resulting from their partnership agreement said the two sides had expressed a readiness to “ ensure continuous and steady growth of bilateral trade and gradually improve the balance of bilateral trade through development in accordance with the principle of equality , mutual benefit , reciprocity and win-win result . ”
a few months down the line the export import bank of china -lrb- china eximbank -rrb- has granted belgrade a billion euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- loan to upgrade two power plants and build a much-needed bridge over the beautiful blue danube .

" in a way , cheap chinese money is an alternative to commercially expensive western money or politically expensive money from the international monetary fund or the world bank . "
the politics of economics but money is not the only factor at play .
reljic says beijing 's activities in the balkans are as much about political positioning as they are about financial returns .
" this increased presence is also a signal to the us and the west that china is no longer a peripheral world power , but it is the world power and it is engaging in all political developments throughout the world with its own agenda . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kosovo is serbia " graffiti is testimony to kosovo 's disputed independence an example of that agenda is beijing 's vehement opposition to kosovo 's independence .
china recently spoke out against kosovo 's split from serbia at the international court of justice in the hague .
yet many analysts would say such public displays of support have less to do with china 's concern over stability in the balkans region than with a concern that its own minority groups might follow kosovo 's lead towards independence .

more and more , consumers are letting their mouse do the walking as they buy everything from books and plane tickets to computers and cars over the internet .
but how safe is their credit card information ? e-commerce is here to stay .
the question is : what happens to your information once the transaction is finished ?
do e-commerce establishments delete your information ?
the answer is : not always , as shoppers who use amazon know .
for ease of shopping , amazon asks customers if they want the company to retain their information so that their next transaction will be quicker .
many consumers give their consent and consider the process transparent .
but what about other websites ?
how secure should people feel ?
hackers are continually devising new ways of getting access to consumers ' credit card numbers via the internet .
one of the highest profile cases occurred in 2007 , when unknown hackers got into the databases of off-price retailers tj maxx and marshall 's in the us and stole more than 45 million credit card numbers .
thus , security is one of the big issues when it comes to online commerce and that was a major topic in the banking and finance hall at this year 's cebit trade show in hannover .
joachim gebauer is a technical manager at verisign , a digital security company that provides security for web transactions of all kinds .
“ if you offer e-commerce , you really should think : how can i bring in a layer of security and bring trust to my website ? ” said gebauer .
small and medium enterprise bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : data security is vital to small and medium sized businesses on the internet one official from the federal office for information security -lrb- bsi -rrb- , germany 's department of internet security acknowledged that the government was actively promoting e-commerce , especially for small to medium size enterprises .
so are consumers safe here in germany ?
“ in germany there is a very strong data privacy law , and that comes from the european union data privacy regulation , where they say every real person and the private information like your name , your address and telephone number has to be protected , ” gebauer said .
germany 's percentage of online shoppers compared to its internet-connected population is the third highest in the world after south korea and the united kingdom . a recent survey by deutsche bank found that while roughly 75 percent of global online payments are made via credit card , only 44 percent of german online shoppers use such a card .
the rest of the population prefers offline transaction methods such as invoicing -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- or direct bank account transfers -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- .
but the question still remains , should companies conducting e-commerce be forced to delete customers ' credit card information after a specific time period ?
and interestingly enough , that is a question that is difficult to answer .
one official at the bsi booth at cebit , speaking off the record said he was n't aware of a law requiring companies to delete credit card details after a set period of time .
axel diekmann , of internet security company kaspersky labs , said that germany 's data protection act only came into force in august 2009 .
companies now have to declare what they are doing with personal data and how long they store it , and give each person a clear answer to the question : what data about me do you store ?
but when it came to the storage of credit card data specifically , diekmann said he had never heard of any regulatory timeframes .
" as far as i 'm aware - i may be mistaken - there is no clear rule for companies as to how long they are allowed or are forced to store specifically the data from credit cards , " he said .
shredding data not difficult bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the secure destruction of data is vital to credit card fraud prevention one thing that is certain is that the technology exists .
there are software applications that can be put on e-commerce servers that will delete credit card numbers from a database .
“ if you 're handling credit card information we can run that program and it will shred or overwrite the information on that server , ” said sami tuupanen , a technical specialist at blancco , a finnish data destruction company .
the technology is pretty simple .
you install the software , tell it to go to a specific file and delete or shred every single credit card number that has been stored before a certain date .
for now , it falls to the consumer to make sure that companies destroy their credit card information .
“ what i would do as a consumer , ” says tuupanen , “ i would be more active , before buying in certain locations . i would question that … are you doing enough on your data security ?
are you getting rid of information which you no longer need ?
or , how long are you storing information about me ? ”

" in a way , cheap chinese money is an alternative to commercially expensive western money or politically expensive money from the international monetary fund or the world bank . "

reljic says beijing 's activities in the balkans are as much about political positioning as they are about financial returns .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 04.03.2010 eu should drop failed sanctions policy against burma , say experts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu sanctions have failed to win the release of burmese opposition leader aung san suu kyi while the eu announced a humanitarian aid package for burma this week , it left in place its 14-year old sanctions regime against the country .
experts say misguided sanctions are the wrong approach and counterproductive . on tuesday , the european union pledged to provide 17.3 million euros -lrb- $ 23.4 million -rrb- in humanitarian aid this year to burma .
most of the money is slated for the country 's ethnic minorities and refugees living in the country 's border areas or in refugee camps in thailand .
while the eu aid package may provide much needed short-term help for burma , also know as myanmar , which ranks 138th out of 182 nations in the united nation 's human development index , it does n't address the most critical issue in europe 's dealings with the country , say experts .
since 1996 the eu has slapped various sanctions against the country 's military regime .
in its latest round of punitive measures last summer , after a court ruling extended the house arrest of opposition leader and nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi , the eu expanded its travel ban and asset freeze against the junta .
other sanctions include an arms export ban , visa restrictions against members of the regime , limited diplomatic relations , an end of development programs and an export ban on timber , gems and metals .
stronger government control the goal of the eu 's sanctions is to target and weaken burma 's repressive junta , which has ruled the country since 1962 .
however , argue experts , after 14 years of sanctions , it is time to recognize that the eu 's punitive policy against the regime simply has not worked .
" eu sanctions against myanmar have been a long line of failures , as most sanctions are , " writes niklas swanström , a burma expert and director of the stockholm-based institute for security and development policy , in his latest report on the issue .
" what we see today in myanmar is not a weakened government and political change , but stronger governmental control of resources and people and increased interaction with , and influence of primarily china , but also india , thailand , russia and other actors , with the marginalization of european interaction and influence . "
bildunterschrift : the military rules with an iron fist over burma while the eu and the us have slapped sanctions against burma , most other countries have not , making it easy for the regime to circumvent the sanctions by dealing with other nations . " myanmar is ravaged by chinese businesses that extract natural resources , " says swanström .
" we have no possibility to influence that , so in a sense we lose every possibility to have an impact . "
counterproductive measures what 's more , says michael von hauff , an economist and burma expert at the university of kaiserslautern , the sanctions are not just ineffective , they are actually counterproductive and hurt not the ruling clique , but the burmese people .
" the living conditions of the people have deteriorated and for example many young women in the textile sector lost their jobs , " he told deutsche welle . recent events tend to underscore the experts ' perception that the junta 's demeanor and stance has not been altered by the sanctions regime .
last month , an american citizen and human rights activist was sentenced to five years in prison for forging an identity card .
shortly thereafter , four other human rights activists were sentenced to prison terms on the day of the arrival of the un 's human rights envoy .
during his five day-trip , un envoy tomas ojea quintana was n't allowed to visit aung san suu kyi .
instead of sanctions , the eu should try to engage in a dialogue with the regime .
this dialogue policy should n't focus primarily on the junta leaders , but rather on mid-level government officials , says von hauff .
he has been travelling to burma regularly since 2001 to hold seminars and made an important observation : " it was really interesting that most of the people from the ministries were very open .
we could discuss all the problems and also the human rights situation .
so we should have a differentiated picture of the country . "
push from washington bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : childen suffer especially from the dismal economic situation in burma but in order to engage the government effectively , the eu must first drop its current failed sanctions policy , argue von hauff and swanström .
only than can it regain any possible leverage on the junta , which it lost through the sanctions .
whether and when that could happen neither of the experts venture to say .
the push to change the eu 's policy toward burma could come once again from the us .
washington has recently sent some signals that it is rethinking its sanctions regime . should washington decide to change its policy , the eu would probably do so as well , says von hauff .
" i have the feeling that we have the sanctions because the united states has sanctions and so the eu has to have sanctions as well . "

the hungarian-born is recognized with this year 's chamisso prize for non-native german authors . it is a freezing cold afternoon in berlin .
outside , people are trudging through the snow with shopping bags ; others are hurrying to crowded trams .
terezia mora is taking refuge in a small courtyard movie theater .
the window panes are fogged up and the interior is glaringly empty . to lose herself in a film , to have the whole screen for herself while everyone else is working , to disappear in a hectic rush - for terezia mora , this is a pleasant distraction from writing .
and it reminds her of the 1990s , when she left hungary at the age of 19 to study in germany . " i went to the movies almost seven times a week because that 's what i had missed the most in my little home village , " explained mora .
" here in berlin i could really feel free . "
bleak no-man 's land terezia mora was born in hungary and her family belonged to the country 's german minority .
