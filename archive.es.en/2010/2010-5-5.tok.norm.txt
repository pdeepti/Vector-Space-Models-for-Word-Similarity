for residents of southern italy , the marsili is just one more disaster threat to live with . just off italy 's southwestern coast , about 450 meters beneath the tyrrhenian sea , lies europe 's largest underwater volcano .
the marsili volcano , which measures 70 kilometers long and 30 kilometers wide , made headlines worldwide recently after geologists uncovered disturbing new information .
new research by the national institute for geophysics and volcanology -lrb- ingv -rrb- in italy , found that the volcano is losing magnetism and that its walls are weakening .
geologists say marsili could collapse at any moment .
if the volcano 's walls were to crumble , it would force thousands of tons of magma into the sea , setting off a tsunami .
" this could happen due to an eruption , seismic events - or another scenario - and these factors can change the equilibrium of the volcano , " said filipo muccini , one of the authors of the report , who is based at the ingv office in the seaside town of fezzano .
geologists can not predict when or how the marsili volcano would erupt , but they predict a tsunami triggered by such an event would hit the coast of southern italy , including the regions of calabria and campania , and the island of sicily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in italy have found that the volcano 's walls are weakening residents of southern italy not alarmed " no one is really aware of the issue and no one really feels threatened , " palermo native elia cusimano told deutsche welle .
" i guess it 's a problem of a lack of information .
but then again , sicily has several other volcanoes . "
southern italians are no strangers to threats of natural disaster .
several active volcanoes can be found in the region , including mount vesuvis , mount stromboli and mount etna in sicily - europe 's largest active volcano .
" every year we get eruptions and the local people seem to have a very strange relationship with the volcano , " said cusimano .
" on the one hand they complain because their houses get destroyed from time to time .
at the same time , they have a really high esteem for the volcano because it brings in a lot of tourism and makes the area really attractive . "
meanwhile , cusimano said residents of catania , the largest town near the etna volcano , feel little threat that their city could go the way of the ancient cities herculaneum and pompeii , which were destroyed by the eruption of the volcano mount vesuvius .
the people of sicily may not worry about volcanic eruptions on a daily basis , but geologists believe the threat presented by the marsili is serious enough to require better observation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the legacy of pompeii , southern italy 's residents stay calm geologists call for closer monitoring though scientists already use a central observatory to observe the volcano , muccini said the station is not equipped to perform real-time checks and only stores and processes data from the sea floor .
but the data compiled so far indicates that the marsili volcano is unique worldwide .
" the drastic decrease that we have recorded on the top of the seamount - especially for the magnetic and gravity field - are , perhaps , considered very exceptional , " said luca cocchi , another author of the marsili volcano report at ingv .
marsili is just one of an estimated 5,000 active submarine volcanoes in the world . although there is evidence that marsili has been active in the past , the volcano has never erupted in recorded history .
according to cocchi , the main obstacle to marsili observation efforts - in the same manner as vesuvius and etna - is funding .
" in the case of the marsili , we know very well its morphology and its evolution , " cocchi said . " but we do n't at this moment if - how and when - it may erupt . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 05.05.2010 new york trio picks up germany 's first echo award for jazz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vijay iyer trio are pioneers for the echo jazz award the german echo awards , like the grammys , are among the world 's most prestigious music prizes .
on may 5 , the first-ever echo for jazz is awarded to the vijay iyer trio from new york . it 's the first time the german record industry will present the echo distinctions - until now monopolized by the pop and classical sectors - for jazz , a genre which has been growing in popularity over the past few years . the vijay iyer trio , with stephan crump on bass , marcus gilmore on drums and bandleader vijay iyer on piano , rocked the jazz scene last fall with their new album " historicity . "
it was hailed by critics on both sides of the atlantic as the best jazz cd of 2009 . still , the band was surprised to be selected for the jazz echo award just months later .
they were n't only selected by an expert jury , but also by the music-loving public as reflected in record and down-load sales . " it 's nice to know that there is both a critical embrace and an audience embrace sort of working together , " said iyer . from math to music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iyer links the rational with the emotional in his music band founder vijay iyer is multi-talented .
born the son of indian immigrants to the us , he grew up playing classical violin .
he studied mathematics and physics at yale university and graduated from the university of california at berkeley with a doctorate in arts and technology . during his student days he started playing piano , jammed in jazz clubs , and began exploring composition .
for him , music became the powerhouse of creativity and the means of self-expression that he had been searching for .
but the mathematician in the musician remained . " anything that 's put together with care and precision involves measurement and that 's also true in music , " said iyer .
" you have measurements of time and measurements of frequency or pitch , to perceive music is to perceive order in sound , so when you 're talking about mathematics in music , you 're talking about ordering events . " the trio 's album combines mathematical with spiritual and emotional elements - which iyer said do n't contradict each other but have always coexisted in music . the bedrock of jazz this synthesis of mathematical perfection and deep spirituality has underpinned vijay iyer 's works since the late 1990s .
he has composed for orchestras and string quartets and written ballet scores and movie soundtracks , but his heart belongs to jazz in general and his echo-award-winning trio in particular . for iyer , the genre of the piano trio has been an elemental force in the development of jazz music . " it 's something so deeply explored by so many masters , especially the pianist-composers like duke ellington or herbie nichols - people who had a vision of how music can sound , " said iyer .
" i 'm not caught up in displaying my own virtuosity but i 'm interested in projecting a unity of intent and that 's something the trio can offer . " that " unity of intent " may be difficult to define but is highly apparent when listening to the trio 's music .
vijay iyer is the composer and frontman , but when the band performs , he does not regard himself as a conductor in the classical sense .
improvisation is the life-blood of jazz , he said , but this has to be given a structure created by the composer . " most of the time , when i 'm composing , i 'm setting up a situation for things to happen , so it 's more like architecture , in the sense that i want people to move around in it , " said iyer , " i want people to live and stretch out and be free inside of the space that i 've created . " the audience as a creative force when the vijay iyer trio takes the stage wednesday evening in bochum to pick up the first-ever echo for the best international jazz ensemble , the band says it will be sharing the award with a huge though nameless creative force that has always been behind it : its audiences on both sides of the atlantic . vijay iyer highlighted that the trio is not making music for itself in an aesthetic vacuum , but aims above all to connect with the listeners . " this is something i think is inherent to jazz in particular because there 's so much improvisation involved , there 's really a sense that the music is being created just for that moment and not just for its own sake but for the force of communication and connection , " said the musician . " the more we get back from the audience , the more it impels us to push ourselves and explore and create .

the bank was engulfed in flames when hooded youths threw petrol bombs during the demonstrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou condemned the killings officials said that two government buildings had also been set alight .
parliament , which was meeting when the incident took place , held a minute of silence for the dead .
prime minister george papandreou condemned the killings as a " murderous act . " eu president herman van rompuy insisted it was " extremely important " that the greek government impose the austerity measures but voiced sympathy over the deaths .
" our first thoughts today turn to the victims in athens , " he said . while the right to protest remained sacred , president of the european commission jose manuel barroso said , " nothing can justify the recourse to violence . "

police estimated the crowd size to be more than 25,000 , though other media reports put the number as high as 60,000 .
in thessaloniki , youths smashed the windows of stores and fast food restaurants as 20,000 people marched through the city center .

" there is always a risk of contagion , " said dominique strauss-kahn , the head of the international monetary fund , in an interview with french daily le parisien on wednesday .
" portugal has been mentioned , but it is already taking measures and the other countries are in a much more solid situation .
we have to succeed in avoiding contagion ... but we should remain vigilant . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 05.05.2010 new york trio picks up germany 's first echo award for jazz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vijay iyer trio are pioneers for the echo jazz award the german echo awards , like the grammys , are among the world 's most prestigious music prizes .
on may 5 , the first-ever echo for jazz is awarded to the vijay iyer trio from new york . it 's the first time the german record industry will present the echo distinctions - until now monopolized by the pop and classical sectors - for jazz , a genre which has been growing in popularity over the past few years . the vijay iyer trio , with stephan crump on bass , marcus gilmore on drums and bandleader vijay iyer on piano , rocked the jazz scene last fall with their new album " historicity . "
it was hailed by critics on both sides of the atlantic as the best jazz cd of 2009 . still , the band was surprised to be selected for the jazz echo award just months later .
they were n't only selected by an expert jury , but also by the music-loving public as reflected in record and down-load sales . " it 's nice to know that there is both a critical embrace and an audience embrace sort of working together , " said iyer . from math to music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iyer links the rational with the emotional in his music band founder vijay iyer is multi-talented .
born the son of indian immigrants to the us , he grew up playing classical violin .
he studied mathematics and physics at yale university and graduated from the university of california at berkeley with a doctorate in arts and technology . during his student days he started playing piano , jammed in jazz clubs , and began exploring composition .
for him , music became the powerhouse of creativity and the means of self-expression that he had been searching for .
but the mathematician in the musician remained . " anything that 's put together with care and precision involves measurement and that 's also true in music , " said iyer .
" you have measurements of time and measurements of frequency or pitch , to perceive music is to perceive order in sound , so when you 're talking about mathematics in music , you 're talking about ordering events . " the trio 's album combines mathematical with spiritual and emotional elements - which iyer said do n't contradict each other but have always coexisted in music . the bedrock of jazz this synthesis of mathematical perfection and deep spirituality has underpinned vijay iyer 's works since the late 1990s .
he has composed for orchestras and string quartets and written ballet scores and movie soundtracks , but his heart belongs to jazz in general and his echo-award-winning trio in particular . for iyer , the genre of the piano trio has been an elemental force in the development of jazz music . " it 's something so deeply explored by so many masters , especially the pianist-composers like duke ellington or herbie nichols - people who had a vision of how music can sound , " said iyer .
" i 'm not caught up in displaying my own virtuosity but i 'm interested in projecting a unity of intent and that 's something the trio can offer . " that " unity of intent " may be difficult to define but is highly apparent when listening to the trio 's music .
vijay iyer is the composer and frontman , but when the band performs , he does not regard himself as a conductor in the classical sense .
improvisation is the life-blood of jazz , he said , but this has to be given a structure created by the composer . " most of the time , when i 'm composing , i 'm setting up a situation for things to happen , so it 's more like architecture , in the sense that i want people to move around in it , " said iyer , " i want people to live and stretch out and be free inside of the space that i 've created . " the audience as a creative force when the vijay iyer trio takes the stage wednesday evening in bochum to pick up the first-ever echo for the best international jazz ensemble , the band says it will be sharing the award with a huge though nameless creative force that has always been behind it : its audiences on both sides of the atlantic . vijay iyer highlighted that the trio is not making music for itself in an aesthetic vacuum , but aims above all to connect with the listeners . " this is something i think is inherent to jazz in particular because there 's so much improvisation involved , there 's really a sense that the music is being created just for that moment and not just for its own sake but for the force of communication and connection , " said the musician . " the more we get back from the audience , the more it impels us to push ourselves and explore and create .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 05.05.2010 biden speech could set the record straight on eu-us relations , say legislators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the expectations are high for joe biden 's speech in brussels in what the white house has billed a major address , us vice president biden will speak at the european parliament on thursday .
members of parliament hope that he will reaffirm us-eu ties - and patch up a few things . members of the european parliament should highlight february 11 , 2010 in their calendars .
it was on that thursday a couple of months ago that they and their institution for the first time appeared in earnest on the radar of most us politicians .
prior to that day and their overwhelming , cross-party rejection of the transfer of financial data to the us under the so-called swift agreement , the european parliament and its work went largely unnoticed in washington .
the swift veto that has left eu and us officials scrambling since then for a replacement agreement served as a wake-up call that a new player with real power had emerged on europe 's political landscape .
that 's certainly true , says elmar brok , chairman of the european parliament delegation with the us and a leading member of the european people 's party .
he adds that washington has realized that the legislature does n't only have overall codecison powers , but also that parliament has to ratify all third country agreements and treaties of the eu .
the message was that in effect , says brok , " nothing can be decided at the end of the day against the will of the european parliament . "
unusual business joe biden 's speech before the european parliament therefore should also be viewed against the backdrop of the body 's newly asserted role .
" it is indeed not everyday business that the vice president of the united states would visit the european parliament and in a way i think the obama administration is paying tribute to the newly enhanced role of the parliament , " says reinhard buetikofer , a member of the delegation with the us and vice-chair of the greens in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament 's veto of the swift agreement put it on the map in washington what 's more , argue brok and buetikofer , biden 's brussel 's speech can serve as an important signal of cooperation between the us and the eu after president barack obama 's decision to cancel his participation in the upcoming bilateral summit in madrid caused some consternation in europe .
buetikofer also hopes that biden , a former senator with vast experience in foreign relations , will set the record straight on europe 's contribution to international security .
refering to a speech us secretary of state hillary clinton gave earlier this year in paris , buetikofer says he was surprised that clinton did n't mention europe 's common foreign and security policy at all .
" so people have wondered , including myself , whether the european contribution to europe 's security , the european engagement in missions like atalanta -lrb- the eu 's anti-piracy operation off the coast of somalia - ed . -rrb- , are at all on the screen in washington . "
so while biden could clearly patch up a few things in european-american affairs , relations between the european parliament and its us counterpart are on a good track since the swift vote . reinvigorate transatlantic dialogue " when we spoke to members of congress in march they explained that the speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , had decided to upgrade the status of the transatlantic legislators dialogue -lrb- tld -rrb- within congress , " says buetikofer .
the tld is a long-standing debate forum for european and us parlamentarians that has effectively been in a deep slumber since its inception - mostly due to a lack of interest from the american side .
now , says brok , is the time to wake it up .
" we have to strengthen the transatlantic legislators dialogue .
we have to work on that in the future and have closer relationships with committees and rapporteurs concerned in order to avoid that we legislate in the us congress or in the european parliament in a way that goes in different directions which would be unhelpful for both sides . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : house speaker nancy pelosi supports stronger ties to european legislators while the house of representatives under the leadership of nancy pelosi has already understood the importance of closer cooperation with european parliamentarians , the us senate is still more reluctant , say brok and buetikofer .
both eu parliamentarians emphasize that striving for closer ties with the us does n't negate reaching out to other countries as well . " however we do see a clear agenda with regard to the transatlantic relationship and it needs some attention , " says buetikofer .
" we should n't let that slip away , just because we believe that asia is coming up strong and that we should also pay attention to that .
i think the parliament has the power and the vision to do both . "

refering to a speech us secretary of state hillary clinton gave earlier this year in paris , buetikofer says he was surprised that clinton did n't mention europe 's common foreign and security policy at all .
" so people have wondered , including myself , whether the european contribution to europe 's security , the european engagement in missions like atalanta -lrb- the eu 's anti-piracy operation off the coast of somalia - ed . -rrb- , are at all on the screen in washington . "
so while biden could clearly patch up a few things in european-american affairs , relations between the european parliament and its us counterpart are on a good track since the swift vote . reinvigorate transatlantic dialogue " when we spoke to members of congress in march they explained that the speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , had decided to upgrade the status of the transatlantic legislators dialogue -lrb- tld -rrb- within congress , " says buetikofer .
the tld is a long-standing debate forum for european and us parlamentarians that has effectively been in a deep slumber since its inception - mostly due to a lack of interest from the american side .
now , says brok , is the time to wake it up .
" we have to strengthen the transatlantic legislators dialogue .
we have to work on that in the future and have closer relationships with committees and rapporteurs concerned in order to avoid that we legislate in the us congress or in the european parliament in a way that goes in different directions which would be unhelpful for both sides . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : house speaker nancy pelosi supports stronger ties to european legislators while the house of representatives under the leadership of nancy pelosi has already understood the importance of closer cooperation with european parliamentarians , the us senate is still more reluctant , say brok and buetikofer .
both eu parliamentarians emphasize that striving for closer ties with the us does n't negate reaching out to other countries as well . " however we do see a clear agenda with regard to the transatlantic relationship and it needs some attention , " says buetikofer .
" we should n't let that slip away , just because we believe that asia is coming up strong and that we should also pay attention to that .
i think the parliament has the power and the vision to do both . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 05.05.2010 new york trio picks up germany 's first echo award for jazz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vijay iyer trio are pioneers for the echo jazz award the german echo awards , like the grammys , are among the world 's most prestigious music prizes .
on may 5 , the first-ever echo for jazz is awarded to the vijay iyer trio from new york . it 's the first time the german record industry will present the echo distinctions - until now monopolized by the pop and classical sectors - for jazz , a genre which has been growing in popularity over the past few years . the vijay iyer trio , with stephan crump on bass , marcus gilmore on drums and bandleader vijay iyer on piano , rocked the jazz scene last fall with their new album " historicity . "
it was hailed by critics on both sides of the atlantic as the best jazz cd of 2009 . still , the band was surprised to be selected for the jazz echo award just months later .
they were n't only selected by an expert jury , but also by the music-loving public as reflected in record and down-load sales . " it 's nice to know that there is both a critical embrace and an audience embrace sort of working together , " said iyer . from math to music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iyer links the rational with the emotional in his music band founder vijay iyer is multi-talented .
born the son of indian immigrants to the us , he grew up playing classical violin .
he studied mathematics and physics at yale university and graduated from the university of california at berkeley with a doctorate in arts and technology . during his student days he started playing piano , jammed in jazz clubs , and began exploring composition .
for him , music became the powerhouse of creativity and the means of self-expression that he had been searching for .
but the mathematician in the musician remained . " anything that 's put together with care and precision involves measurement and that 's also true in music , " said iyer .
" you have measurements of time and measurements of frequency or pitch , to perceive music is to perceive order in sound , so when you 're talking about mathematics in music , you 're talking about ordering events . " the trio 's album combines mathematical with spiritual and emotional elements - which iyer said do n't contradict each other but have always coexisted in music . the bedrock of jazz this synthesis of mathematical perfection and deep spirituality has underpinned vijay iyer 's works since the late 1990s .
he has composed for orchestras and string quartets and written ballet scores and movie soundtracks , but his heart belongs to jazz in general and his echo-award-winning trio in particular . for iyer , the genre of the piano trio has been an elemental force in the development of jazz music . " it 's something so deeply explored by so many masters , especially the pianist-composers like duke ellington or herbie nichols - people who had a vision of how music can sound , " said iyer .
" i 'm not caught up in displaying my own virtuosity but i 'm interested in projecting a unity of intent and that 's something the trio can offer . " that " unity of intent " may be difficult to define but is highly apparent when listening to the trio 's music .
vijay iyer is the composer and frontman , but when the band performs , he does not regard himself as a conductor in the classical sense .
improvisation is the life-blood of jazz , he said , but this has to be given a structure created by the composer . " most of the time , when i 'm composing , i 'm setting up a situation for things to happen , so it 's more like architecture , in the sense that i want people to move around in it , " said iyer , " i want people to live and stretch out and be free inside of the space that i 've created . " the audience as a creative force when the vijay iyer trio takes the stage wednesday evening in bochum to pick up the first-ever echo for the best international jazz ensemble , the band says it will be sharing the award with a huge though nameless creative force that has always been behind it : its audiences on both sides of the atlantic . vijay iyer highlighted that the trio is not making music for itself in an aesthetic vacuum , but aims above all to connect with the listeners . " this is something i think is inherent to jazz in particular because there 's so much improvisation involved , there 's really a sense that the music is being created just for that moment and not just for its own sake but for the force of communication and connection , " said the musician . " the more we get back from the audience , the more it impels us to push ourselves and explore and create .

however , much appears to depend on preventing the type of economic collapse seen in greece from spreading . economic growth in the eu is set to pick up faster than previously expected according to the european commission – provided that the type of economic collapse seen in greece can be kept contained .
the commission on wednesday raised growth predictions for the eurozone to 0.9 percent this year , compared to a 0.7 percent forecast made in february .
however , brussels warned of the potential of a domino effect that could bring down other european economies with high burdens of debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green shoots of recovery are threatened by wider financial collapse the danger posed by wider financial meltdown was likened that of a forest fire by eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn .
" in order to safeguard the economic recovery , which is still rather modest and somewhat fragile , it 's absolutely essential to contain the bushfire in greece so that it will not become a forest fire , " said rehn .
threat to stability the fear of economic contagion constituted a real " threat to financial stability for the european union and its economy as a whole , " rehn stressed .
greece is close to the brink of debt default , requiring a bailout by other members of the european union and the international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece , on the brink of default , has asked for help the forecasts reveal weaknesses in states such as spain , portugal and ireland , which have high debt along with low growth or recession .
spain 's deficit is tipped to hit almost 10 per cent of gross domestic product in 2010 , with the economy shrinking by 0.4 percent .
britain has the highest deficit of the eu countries considered at risk , set to hit 12 percent of gdp in 2010 .
however , the british economy is expected to grow by 1.2 percent during the same period . according to the twice-yearly forecast , growth for the eu as a whole is set to reach 1 per cent this year and 1.7 per cent next year .
growth is expected to be driven by demand from emerging economies such as china and brazil , rather than demand within europe. rc / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the disruption looks set to be far less than last month 's . a fresh volcanic ash cloud forced british and irish air traffic authorities to close parts of their airspace on wednesday , as iceland 's eyjafjallajoekull volcano continued to disrupt european flight paths .
a drifting cloud of ash from the volcano led to flights being halted across most of the continent for almost a week in april .
britain 's civil aviation authority -lrb- caa -rrb- said late on tuesday that air traffic to and from three airports in scotland , including glasgow , would not be allowed as of 6 a.m. gmt wednesday .
the airport in edinburgh , scotland ’ s capital , remained open until midday .
belfast 's airport , in northern ireland , was also closed and flights to and from dublin in the republic of ireland were shut down from 10 a.m.
the irish aviation authority said all airports in ireland could be affected by early afternoon .
" forecasts show that levels of ash in the atmosphere over scotland and northern ireland will exceed the concentrations that engine manufacturers have agreed are safe for operations , " the caa said in a statement .
ash from iceland had caused a similar closure in the same areas from monday until the middle of tuesday this week .
both irish and british authorities fear the volcanic ash , which can damage aircraft engines and instruments when present in large quantities , will spread south during the day , perhaps causing further airport closures in the north of england .
smaller disruptions however , the caa said there was no imminent threat to britain ’ s busiest southern airports , like london 's heathrow and gatwick .
the primary ash cloud from eyjafjallajoekull 's eruption in april brought the majority of european air travel to a standstill for six days , leaving millions of travellers stranded and costing airlines and industry hundreds of millions of euros .
at a meeting on tuesday , european union transport ministers agreed the eu should immediately create a unified air traffic group to ensure member states coordinate their reactions to any similar problems in the future , in a bid to minimize disruptions and costs. msh / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

faisal shahzad is an american citizen of pakistani origin . faisal shahzad has apparently confessed to planting the bomb in times square , but in his home country , pakistan , the reactions vary : some are skeptical and some are in denial . one accountant from karachi is in disbelief : " what evidence do the americans have ?
they could claim anything to blame us pakistanis for acts of terror . "
a business man is of the opinion : " as long as the usa keeps getting involved in our affairs , the taliban will stay involved in theirs . "
among the pakistani people there is a sense of deep animosity towards america and a feeling of being victimized .
nonetheless the pakistani police has arrested numerous people in connection with the attempted attack in new york .
now authorities are working on finding out if faisal shahzad was acting alone or if he was working for a pakistani terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shahzad was taken into custody on monday while trying to board a flight to dubai bomb making classes in pakistan shahzad has reportedly stated he was trained in bomb-making in his home country .

before that , the group had carried out other attacks in india , among them on the indian parliament in delhi .
experts also believe that let was planning to carry out an attack on the american embassy in bangladesh in november .

however , much appears to depend on preventing the type of economic collapse seen in greece from spreading . economic growth in the eu is set to pick up faster than previously expected according to the european commission – provided that the type of economic collapse seen in greece can be kept contained .
the commission on wednesday raised growth predictions for the eurozone to 0.9 percent this year , compared to a 0.7 percent forecast made in february .
however , brussels warned of the potential of a domino effect that could bring down other european economies with high burdens of debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green shoots of recovery are threatened by wider financial collapse the danger posed by wider financial meltdown was likened that of a forest fire by eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn .
" in order to safeguard the economic recovery , which is still rather modest and somewhat fragile , it 's absolutely essential to contain the bushfire in greece so that it will not become a forest fire , " said rehn .
threat to stability the fear of economic contagion constituted a real " threat to financial stability for the european union and its economy as a whole , " rehn stressed .
greece is close to the brink of debt default , requiring a bailout by other members of the european union and the international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece , on the brink of default , has asked for help the forecasts reveal weaknesses in states such as spain , portugal and ireland , which have high debt along with low growth or recession .
spain 's deficit is tipped to hit almost 10 per cent of gross domestic product in 2010 , with the economy shrinking by 0.4 percent .
britain has the highest deficit of the eu countries considered at risk , set to hit 12 percent of gdp in 2010 .
however , the british economy is expected to grow by 1.2 percent during the same period . according to the twice-yearly forecast , growth for the eu as a whole is set to reach 1 per cent this year and 1.7 per cent next year .
growth is expected to be driven by demand from emerging economies such as china and brazil , rather than demand within europe. rc / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rioters threw petrol bombs and stones in a bid to storm parliament , while police used tear gas . at least three people are reported dead as protests in athens turned violent on wednesday .
fire officials in athens revealed that bodies had been found in the bank building , which lay on the route of a march against government austerity cuts . " we have found three dead people in the building that is on fire , " the fire brigade said . police said that some 20 people were evacuated from the building , a branch of the marfin bank group , after it was set alight by protesters . two women and one man had died , police said , with five people from the bank wounded .
the bank was engulfed in flames when hooded youths threw petrol bombs during the demonstrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou condemned the killings officials said that two government buildings had also been set alight .
parliament , which was meeting when the incident took place , held a minute of silence for the dead .
prime minister george papandreou condemned the killings as a " murderous act . " eu president herman van rompuy insisted it was " extremely important " that the greek government impose the austerity measures but voiced sympathy over the deaths .
" our first thoughts today turn to the victims in athens , " he said . while the right to protest remained sacred , president of the european commission jose manuel barroso said , " nothing can justify the recourse to violence . "
nationwide clashes police clashed with protesters in both the capital and the northern city of thessaloniki , with tens of thousands of greeks marching against the government ’ s harsh new spending cuts amid a nationwide strike .
at least 50 people tried to storm the parliament building in athens , throwing rocks at police who responded with tear gas and stun grenades .
police estimated the crowd size to be more than 25,000 , though other media reports put the number as high as 60,000 .
in thessaloniki , youths smashed the windows of stores and fast food restaurants as 20,000 people marched through the city center .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-communist protesters shouted slogans outside the parliament the nationwide strike brought greece to a standstill as unions rallied against major new spending cuts aimed at warding off a financial meltdown .
transport network closed public transport was shut down for the day , with trains and ferries sitting empty .
flights in and out of the country were grounded at midnight .
schools , hospitals and tax offices remained closed after public workers launched a 48-hour national strike on tuesday , and shops were expected to shutter during the rallies .
the acropolis and other ancient sites were also to remain closed .
greece 's main unions met in central athens at 11 a.m. local time before heading off on protest marches through the streets of the capital .
more than 1,500 police were expected to be on duty .
on saturday , may day marches resulted in clashes between anarchists and police .
hundreds of thousands of civil servants kicked off the demonstrations on tuesday , protesting against the latest round of spending cuts and tax hikes announced on the weekend .
the government agreed to the latest austerity package in return for the promise of a bailout of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 142.8 billion -rrb- in loans over three years from eurozone countries and the international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chanceller angela merkel has defended the bailout wednesday 's general strike is the third in as many months , and comes as parliament is expected to pass the austerity package on thursday .
markets remain unconvinced financial markets fell sharply on tuesday , seemingly unconvinced that greece 's bailout package will be enough to stop the spread of the financial crisis to other weak eurozone economies in ireland , portugal and spain .
" there is always a risk of contagion , " said dominique strauss-kahn , the head of the international monetary fund , in an interview with french daily le parisien on wednesday .
" portugal has been mentioned , but it is already taking measures and the other countries are in a much more solid situation .
we have to succeed in avoiding contagion ... but we should remain vigilant . "
the euro fell to a one-year low on wednesday , trading at 77 cents against the us dollar. cmk / rc / afp / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision has shocked the organizers of the parade and the country 's president . a lithuanian court on wednesday banned a planned gay rights march in a decision which has shocked organizers and the country 's president .
" there 's a constitutional right to peaceful assembly .
if groups of citizens or organisations are n't illegal , they have a right to express their views , " a spokesperson for president dalia grybauskaite told reporters .
the lithuanian attorney general 's office insists security is the only reason it has asked the court to annul a license for what would have been lithuania 's first gay pride march in the capital vilnius .
" whose fault would it be if anyone gets hurt ?
it might look like we are homophobic , but i am not sure if we 'd look better with pictures of violence on tv , " attorney general raimundas petrauskas said .
petrauskas believes radical and violent groups are organizing protests and provocations against the participants of the gay march .
police reaction the police , however , say that they have enough manpower to ensure security .
around 800 police officers were supposed to protect the marchers .
president dalia grybauskaite said she was astounded by what she calls a failure of communication between two of the country 's institutions .
" the bodies responsible for public order , above all the police , have an obligation to ensure a situation remains calm and there are no clashes , " her spokesperson said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania 's president says she is shocked by the court 's decision .
the organizers of the march are shocked by the decision and have applied for an appeal .
but there is next to no chance the appeal can be heard before saturday .
one of the organizers , arturas rudomanskis from the tolerant youth association , says sexual minorities have a constitutional right to peaceful assembly and it is the police who are to blame if they can not guarantee that right . "
i think the president should look carefully to see if she has chosen the right person for the prosecutors office , " rudomanskis told deutsche welle .
" lithuania was able to protect the us president during his visit here and also the british queen .
so why ca n't the country assure the safety of a peaceful meeting by its own citizens ? " he added .
amnesty international has also condemned the court 's decision , saying that it violates human rights .
" the authorities in lithuania must ensure that the march goes ahead unobstructed and safely as they are obliged under international law to guarantee the rights to freedom to expression and assembly , " john dalhuisen , amnesty international 's expert on discrimination in europe said in a statement .
march part of a five-day festival the gay pride parade was only one event in a five-day festival on the subject of equal rights for sexual minorities .
however , the march has sparked a fierce public debate in staunchly catholic lithunia .
several anti-gay protests have been organized and a group of members of parliament has filed a petition against the march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral of vilnius represents the country 's catholic heritage members of the clergy are among the most outspoken critics , insisting that the most important thing is to protect lithuanian families .

above the ten commandments , above god , above the history of our nation , " alfonsas svarinskas , a priest , told deutsche welle .
it would have been the first ever gay pride parade in vilnius .
previous attempts to organize gay pride marches were banned by local authorities .

the decision has shocked the organizers of the parade and the country 's president . a lithuanian court on wednesday banned a planned gay rights march in a decision which has shocked organizers and the country 's president .
" there 's a constitutional right to peaceful assembly .
if groups of citizens or organisations are n't illegal , they have a right to express their views , " a spokesperson for president dalia grybauskaite told reporters .
the lithuanian attorney general 's office insists security is the only reason it has asked the court to annul a license for what would have been lithuania 's first gay pride march in the capital vilnius .
" whose fault would it be if anyone gets hurt ?
it might look like we are homophobic , but i am not sure if we 'd look better with pictures of violence on tv , " attorney general raimundas petrauskas said .
petrauskas believes radical and violent groups are organizing protests and provocations against the participants of the gay march .
police reaction the police , however , say that they have enough manpower to ensure security .
around 800 police officers were supposed to protect the marchers .
president dalia grybauskaite said she was astounded by what she calls a failure of communication between two of the country 's institutions .
" the bodies responsible for public order , above all the police , have an obligation to ensure a situation remains calm and there are no clashes , " her spokesperson said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania 's president says she is shocked by the court 's decision .
the organizers of the march are shocked by the decision and have applied for an appeal .
but there is next to no chance the appeal can be heard before saturday .
one of the organizers , arturas rudomanskis from the tolerant youth association , says sexual minorities have a constitutional right to peaceful assembly and it is the police who are to blame if they can not guarantee that right . "
i think the president should look carefully to see if she has chosen the right person for the prosecutors office , " rudomanskis told deutsche welle .
" lithuania was able to protect the us president during his visit here and also the british queen .
so why ca n't the country assure the safety of a peaceful meeting by its own citizens ? " he added .
amnesty international has also condemned the court 's decision , saying that it violates human rights .
" the authorities in lithuania must ensure that the march goes ahead unobstructed and safely as they are obliged under international law to guarantee the rights to freedom to expression and assembly , " john dalhuisen , amnesty international 's expert on discrimination in europe said in a statement .
march part of a five-day festival the gay pride parade was only one event in a five-day festival on the subject of equal rights for sexual minorities .
however , the march has sparked a fierce public debate in staunchly catholic lithunia .
several anti-gay protests have been organized and a group of members of parliament has filed a petition against the march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral of vilnius represents the country 's catholic heritage members of the clergy are among the most outspoken critics , insisting that the most important thing is to protect lithuanian families .
" imagine all those wrongdoers in vilnius .
they want to show that their law is above everything .
above the ten commandments , above god , above the history of our nation , " alfonsas svarinskas , a priest , told deutsche welle .
it would have been the first ever gay pride parade in vilnius .
previous attempts to organize gay pride marches were banned by local authorities .
according to a recent eurobarometer survey , lithuanians are the least aware in the european union of the possibility that they may have homosexuals in their own families .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 05.05.2010 biden speech could set the record straight on eu-us relations , say legislators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the expectations are high for joe biden 's speech in brussels in what the white house has billed a major address , us vice president biden will speak at the european parliament on thursday .
members of parliament hope that he will reaffirm us-eu ties - and patch up a few things . members of the european parliament should highlight february 11 , 2010 in their calendars .
it was on that thursday a couple of months ago that they and their institution for the first time appeared in earnest on the radar of most us politicians .
prior to that day and their overwhelming , cross-party rejection of the transfer of financial data to the us under the so-called swift agreement , the european parliament and its work went largely unnoticed in washington .
the swift veto that has left eu and us officials scrambling since then for a replacement agreement served as a wake-up call that a new player with real power had emerged on europe 's political landscape .
that 's certainly true , says elmar brok , chairman of the european parliament delegation with the us and a leading member of the european people 's party .
he adds that washington has realized that the legislature does n't only have overall codecison powers , but also that parliament has to ratify all third country agreements and treaties of the eu .
the message was that in effect , says brok , " nothing can be decided at the end of the day against the will of the european parliament . "
unusual business joe biden 's speech before the european parliament therefore should also be viewed against the backdrop of the body 's newly asserted role .
" it is indeed not everyday business that the vice president of the united states would visit the european parliament and in a way i think the obama administration is paying tribute to the newly enhanced role of the parliament , " says reinhard buetikofer , a member of the delegation with the us and vice-chair of the greens in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament 's veto of the swift agreement put it on the map in washington what 's more , argue brok and buetikofer , biden 's brussel 's speech can serve as an important signal of cooperation between the us and the eu after president barack obama 's decision to cancel his participation in the upcoming bilateral summit in madrid caused some consternation in europe .
buetikofer also hopes that biden , a former senator with vast experience in foreign relations , will set the record straight on europe 's contribution to international security .
refering to a speech us secretary of state hillary clinton gave earlier this year in paris , buetikofer says he was surprised that clinton did n't mention europe 's common foreign and security policy at all .
" so people have wondered , including myself , whether the european contribution to europe 's security , the european engagement in missions like atalanta -lrb- the eu 's anti-piracy operation off the coast of somalia - ed . -rrb- , are at all on the screen in washington . "
so while biden could clearly patch up a few things in european-american affairs , relations between the european parliament and its us counterpart are on a good track since the swift vote . reinvigorate transatlantic dialogue " when we spoke to members of congress in march they explained that the speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , had decided to upgrade the status of the transatlantic legislators dialogue -lrb- tld -rrb- within congress , " says buetikofer .
the tld is a long-standing debate forum for european and us parlamentarians that has effectively been in a deep slumber since its inception - mostly due to a lack of interest from the american side .
now , says brok , is the time to wake it up .
" we have to strengthen the transatlantic legislators dialogue .
we have to work on that in the future and have closer relationships with committees and rapporteurs concerned in order to avoid that we legislate in the us congress or in the european parliament in a way that goes in different directions which would be unhelpful for both sides . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : house speaker nancy pelosi supports stronger ties to european legislators while the house of representatives under the leadership of nancy pelosi has already understood the importance of closer cooperation with european parliamentarians , the us senate is still more reluctant , say brok and buetikofer .
both eu parliamentarians emphasize that striving for closer ties with the us does n't negate reaching out to other countries as well . " however we do see a clear agenda with regard to the transatlantic relationship and it needs some attention , " says buetikofer .
" we should n't let that slip away , just because we believe that asia is coming up strong and that we should also pay attention to that .
i think the parliament has the power and the vision to do both . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 05.05.2010 new york trio picks up germany 's first echo award for jazz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vijay iyer trio are pioneers for the echo jazz award the german echo awards , like the grammys , are among the world 's most prestigious music prizes .
on may 5 , the first-ever echo for jazz is awarded to the vijay iyer trio from new york . it 's the first time the german record industry will present the echo distinctions - until now monopolized by the pop and classical sectors - for jazz , a genre which has been growing in popularity over the past few years . the vijay iyer trio , with stephan crump on bass , marcus gilmore on drums and bandleader vijay iyer on piano , rocked the jazz scene last fall with their new album " historicity . "
it was hailed by critics on both sides of the atlantic as the best jazz cd of 2009 . still , the band was surprised to be selected for the jazz echo award just months later .
they were n't only selected by an expert jury , but also by the music-loving public as reflected in record and down-load sales . " it 's nice to know that there is both a critical embrace and an audience embrace sort of working together , " said iyer . from math to music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iyer links the rational with the emotional in his music band founder vijay iyer is multi-talented .
born the son of indian immigrants to the us , he grew up playing classical violin .
he studied mathematics and physics at yale university and graduated from the university of california at berkeley with a doctorate in arts and technology . during his student days he started playing piano , jammed in jazz clubs , and began exploring composition .
for him , music became the powerhouse of creativity and the means of self-expression that he had been searching for .
but the mathematician in the musician remained . " anything that 's put together with care and precision involves measurement and that 's also true in music , " said iyer .
" you have measurements of time and measurements of frequency or pitch , to perceive music is to perceive order in sound , so when you 're talking about mathematics in music , you 're talking about ordering events . " the trio 's album combines mathematical with spiritual and emotional elements - which iyer said do n't contradict each other but have always coexisted in music . the bedrock of jazz this synthesis of mathematical perfection and deep spirituality has underpinned vijay iyer 's works since the late 1990s .
he has composed for orchestras and string quartets and written ballet scores and movie soundtracks , but his heart belongs to jazz in general and his echo-award-winning trio in particular . for iyer , the genre of the piano trio has been an elemental force in the development of jazz music . " it 's something so deeply explored by so many masters , especially the pianist-composers like duke ellington or herbie nichols - people who had a vision of how music can sound , " said iyer .
" i 'm not caught up in displaying my own virtuosity but i 'm interested in projecting a unity of intent and that 's something the trio can offer . " that " unity of intent " may be difficult to define but is highly apparent when listening to the trio 's music .
vijay iyer is the composer and frontman , but when the band performs , he does not regard himself as a conductor in the classical sense .
improvisation is the life-blood of jazz , he said , but this has to be given a structure created by the composer . " most of the time , when i 'm composing , i 'm setting up a situation for things to happen , so it 's more like architecture , in the sense that i want people to move around in it , " said iyer , " i want people to live and stretch out and be free inside of the space that i 've created . " the audience as a creative force when the vijay iyer trio takes the stage wednesday evening in bochum to pick up the first-ever echo for the best international jazz ensemble , the band says it will be sharing the award with a huge though nameless creative force that has always been behind it : its audiences on both sides of the atlantic . vijay iyer highlighted that the trio is not making music for itself in an aesthetic vacuum , but aims above all to connect with the listeners . " this is something i think is inherent to jazz in particular because there 's so much improvisation involved , there 's really a sense that the music is being created just for that moment and not just for its own sake but for the force of communication and connection , " said the musician . " the more we get back from the audience , the more it impels us to push ourselves and explore and create .

however , much appears to depend on preventing the type of economic collapse seen in greece from spreading . economic growth in the eu is set to pick up faster than previously expected according to the european commission – provided that the type of economic collapse seen in greece can be kept contained .
the commission on wednesday raised growth predictions for the eurozone to 0.9 percent this year , compared to a 0.7 percent forecast made in february .
however , brussels warned of the potential of a domino effect that could bring down other european economies with high burdens of debt .

" in order to safeguard the economic recovery , which is still rather modest and somewhat fragile , it 's absolutely essential to contain the bushfire in greece so that it will not become a forest fire , " said rehn .
threat to stability the fear of economic contagion constituted a real " threat to financial stability for the european union and its economy as a whole , " rehn stressed .

however , much appears to depend on preventing the type of economic collapse seen in greece from spreading . economic growth in the eu is set to pick up faster than previously expected according to the european commission – provided that the type of economic collapse seen in greece can be kept contained .
the commission on wednesday raised growth predictions for the eurozone to 0.9 percent this year , compared to a 0.7 percent forecast made in february .
however , brussels warned of the potential of a domino effect that could bring down other european economies with high burdens of debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green shoots of recovery are threatened by wider financial collapse the danger posed by wider financial meltdown was likened that of a forest fire by eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn .
" in order to safeguard the economic recovery , which is still rather modest and somewhat fragile , it 's absolutely essential to contain the bushfire in greece so that it will not become a forest fire , " said rehn .
threat to stability the fear of economic contagion constituted a real " threat to financial stability for the european union and its economy as a whole , " rehn stressed .
greece is close to the brink of debt default , requiring a bailout by other members of the european union and the international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece , on the brink of default , has asked for help the forecasts reveal weaknesses in states such as spain , portugal and ireland , which have high debt along with low growth or recession .
spain 's deficit is tipped to hit almost 10 per cent of gross domestic product in 2010 , with the economy shrinking by 0.4 percent .
britain has the highest deficit of the eu countries considered at risk , set to hit 12 percent of gdp in 2010 .
however , the british economy is expected to grow by 1.2 percent during the same period . according to the twice-yearly forecast , growth for the eu as a whole is set to reach 1 per cent this year and 1.7 per cent next year .
growth is expected to be driven by demand from emerging economies such as china and brazil , rather than demand within europe. rc / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 05.05.2010 pakistan in the spotlight after failed times square bombing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the intersection of 45th street and seventh avenue where the car bomb was found american authorities have detained a person in connection with the failed times square bombing last saturday .
faisal shahzad is an american citizen of pakistani origin . faisal shahzad has apparently confessed to planting the bomb in times square , but in his home country , pakistan , the reactions vary : some are skeptical and some are in denial . one accountant from karachi is in disbelief : " what evidence do the americans have ?
they could claim anything to blame us pakistanis for acts of terror . "
a business man is of the opinion : " as long as the usa keeps getting involved in our affairs , the taliban will stay involved in theirs . "
among the pakistani people there is a sense of deep animosity towards america and a feeling of being victimized .
nonetheless the pakistani police has arrested numerous people in connection with the attempted attack in new york .
now authorities are working on finding out if faisal shahzad was acting alone or if he was working for a pakistani terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shahzad was taken into custody on monday while trying to board a flight to dubai bomb making classes in pakistan shahzad has reportedly stated he was trained in bomb-making in his home country .
according to statements made by his mother , last year he spent time in northwest pakistan , a stronghold of islamist insurgents .
the group that confessed to the attack is known as the " tehrik-e-taliban pakistan " , but it is still not clear whether or not they are really responsible .
until now they have mainly carried out attacks in pakistan .
but in another video , the leader of the terrorist group , hakimullah mehsud , recently threatened to carry out attacks in american cities .
mehsud was also filmed with a jordanian al qaeda terrorist who was responsible for the deaths of seven cia agents last year in khost , afghanistan .
terrorism beyond the borders so it would seem that tehrik-e-taliban pakistan is looking to expand terrorist activities beyond pakistani borders .
the prohibited group lashkar-e-taiba -lrb- let for short -rrb- is another terrorist group that went beyond the borders .
now it is said they are operating through dummy organizations .
in 2008 they organized the terror attacks in mumbai , in which 175 people were killed .
however , a speaker of the group denies any involvement , stating : neither lashkar-e-taiba nor its founder , hafiz saeed , have anything to do with the mumbai attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombproof courtroom in a mumbai jail where ajmal kasab is being tried but evidence from the trial of the only surviving attacker , ajmal kasab , has proven otherwise .
kasab described in great detail how lashkar-e-taiba recruited and trained him and then sent him to mumbai .
before that , the group had carried out other attacks in india , among them on the indian parliament in delhi .
experts also believe that let was planning to carry out an attack on the american embassy in bangladesh in november .
furthermore , david headley , who is currently imprisoned in the united states and , like shahzad , is of pakistani descent , had also been planning attacks on offices and employees of the danish newspaper " jyllands posten " for the let .
the newspaper had become controversial for the printing of cartoons of the prophet muhammad .
ajmal kasab , the mumbai terrorist , was found guilty of all 86 charges in a court in mumbai on monday .
the sentence is due on thursday ; prosecution has called for capital punishment of the 22 -year-old .

the decision has shocked the organizers of the parade and the country 's president . a lithuanian court on wednesday banned a planned gay rights march in a decision which has shocked organizers and the country 's president .
" there 's a constitutional right to peaceful assembly .
if groups of citizens or organisations are n't illegal , they have a right to express their views , " a spokesperson for president dalia grybauskaite told reporters .
the lithuanian attorney general 's office insists security is the only reason it has asked the court to annul a license for what would have been lithuania 's first gay pride march in the capital vilnius .
" whose fault would it be if anyone gets hurt ?
it might look like we are homophobic , but i am not sure if we 'd look better with pictures of violence on tv , " attorney general raimundas petrauskas said .
petrauskas believes radical and violent groups are organizing protests and provocations against the participants of the gay march .
police reaction the police , however , say that they have enough manpower to ensure security .
around 800 police officers were supposed to protect the marchers .
president dalia grybauskaite said she was astounded by what she calls a failure of communication between two of the country 's institutions .
" the bodies responsible for public order , above all the police , have an obligation to ensure a situation remains calm and there are no clashes , " her spokesperson said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania 's president says she is shocked by the court 's decision .
the organizers of the march are shocked by the decision and have applied for an appeal .
but there is next to no chance the appeal can be heard before saturday .
one of the organizers , arturas rudomanskis from the tolerant youth association , says sexual minorities have a constitutional right to peaceful assembly and it is the police who are to blame if they can not guarantee that right . "
i think the president should look carefully to see if she has chosen the right person for the prosecutors office , " rudomanskis told deutsche welle .
" lithuania was able to protect the us president during his visit here and also the british queen .
so why ca n't the country assure the safety of a peaceful meeting by its own citizens ? " he added .
amnesty international has also condemned the court 's decision , saying that it violates human rights .
" the authorities in lithuania must ensure that the march goes ahead unobstructed and safely as they are obliged under international law to guarantee the rights to freedom to expression and assembly , " john dalhuisen , amnesty international 's expert on discrimination in europe said in a statement .
march part of a five-day festival the gay pride parade was only one event in a five-day festival on the subject of equal rights for sexual minorities .
however , the march has sparked a fierce public debate in staunchly catholic lithunia .
several anti-gay protests have been organized and a group of members of parliament has filed a petition against the march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral of vilnius represents the country 's catholic heritage members of the clergy are among the most outspoken critics , insisting that the most important thing is to protect lithuanian families .
" imagine all those wrongdoers in vilnius .
they want to show that their law is above everything .
above the ten commandments , above god , above the history of our nation , " alfonsas svarinskas , a priest , told deutsche welle .
it would have been the first ever gay pride parade in vilnius .
previous attempts to organize gay pride marches were banned by local authorities .
according to a recent eurobarometer survey , lithuanians are the least aware in the european union of the possibility that they may have homosexuals in their own families .

faisal shahzad is an american citizen of pakistani origin . faisal shahzad has apparently confessed to planting the bomb in times square , but in his home country , pakistan , the reactions vary : some are skeptical and some are in denial . one accountant from karachi is in disbelief : " what evidence do the americans have ?
they could claim anything to blame us pakistanis for acts of terror . "
a business man is of the opinion : " as long as the usa keeps getting involved in our affairs , the taliban will stay involved in theirs . "
among the pakistani people there is a sense of deep animosity towards america and a feeling of being victimized .

the group that confessed to the attack is known as the " tehrik-e-taliban pakistan " , but it is still not clear whether or not they are really responsible .

before that , the group had carried out other attacks in india , among them on the indian parliament in delhi .
experts also believe that let was planning to carry out an attack on the american embassy in bangladesh in november .
furthermore , david headley , who is currently imprisoned in the united states and , like shahzad , is of pakistani descent , had also been planning attacks on offices and employees of the danish newspaper " jyllands posten " for the let .

ajmal kasab , the mumbai terrorist , was found guilty of all 86 charges in a court in mumbai on monday .
the sentence is due on thursday ; prosecution has called for capital punishment of the 22 -year-old .

faisal shahzad is an american citizen of pakistani origin . faisal shahzad has apparently confessed to planting the bomb in times square , but in his home country , pakistan , the reactions vary : some are skeptical and some are in denial . one accountant from karachi is in disbelief : " what evidence do the americans have ?
they could claim anything to blame us pakistanis for acts of terror . "
a business man is of the opinion : " as long as the usa keeps getting involved in our affairs , the taliban will stay involved in theirs . "
among the pakistani people there is a sense of deep animosity towards america and a feeling of being victimized .
nonetheless the pakistani police has arrested numerous people in connection with the attempted attack in new york .
now authorities are working on finding out if faisal shahzad was acting alone or if he was working for a pakistani terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shahzad was taken into custody on monday while trying to board a flight to dubai bomb making classes in pakistan shahzad has reportedly stated he was trained in bomb-making in his home country .
according to statements made by his mother , last year he spent time in northwest pakistan , a stronghold of islamist insurgents .
the group that confessed to the attack is known as the " tehrik-e-taliban pakistan " , but it is still not clear whether or not they are really responsible .
until now they have mainly carried out attacks in pakistan .
but in another video , the leader of the terrorist group , hakimullah mehsud , recently threatened to carry out attacks in american cities .
mehsud was also filmed with a jordanian al qaeda terrorist who was responsible for the deaths of seven cia agents last year in khost , afghanistan .
terrorism beyond the borders so it would seem that tehrik-e-taliban pakistan is looking to expand terrorist activities beyond pakistani borders .
the prohibited group lashkar-e-taiba -lrb- let for short -rrb- is another terrorist group that went beyond the borders .
now it is said they are operating through dummy organizations .
in 2008 they organized the terror attacks in mumbai , in which 175 people were killed .
however , a speaker of the group denies any involvement , stating : neither lashkar-e-taiba nor its founder , hafiz saeed , have anything to do with the mumbai attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombproof courtroom in a mumbai jail where ajmal kasab is being tried but evidence from the trial of the only surviving attacker , ajmal kasab , has proven otherwise .
kasab described in great detail how lashkar-e-taiba recruited and trained him and then sent him to mumbai .
before that , the group had carried out other attacks in india , among them on the indian parliament in delhi .
experts also believe that let was planning to carry out an attack on the american embassy in bangladesh in november .
furthermore , david headley , who is currently imprisoned in the united states and , like shahzad , is of pakistani descent , had also been planning attacks on offices and employees of the danish newspaper " jyllands posten " for the let .
the newspaper had become controversial for the printing of cartoons of the prophet muhammad .
ajmal kasab , the mumbai terrorist , was found guilty of all 86 charges in a court in mumbai on monday .
the sentence is due on thursday ; prosecution has called for capital punishment of the 22 -year-old .

it was hailed by critics on both sides of the atlantic as the best jazz cd of 2009 . still , the band was surprised to be selected for the jazz echo award just months later .
they were n't only selected by an expert jury , but also by the music-loving public as reflected in record and down-load sales . " it 's nice to know that there is both a critical embrace and an audience embrace sort of working together , " said iyer . from math to music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iyer links the rational with the emotional in his music band founder vijay iyer is multi-talented .
born the son of indian immigrants to the us , he grew up playing classical violin .
he studied mathematics and physics at yale university and graduated from the university of california at berkeley with a doctorate in arts and technology . during his student days he started playing piano , jammed in jazz clubs , and began exploring composition .
for him , music became the powerhouse of creativity and the means of self-expression that he had been searching for .
but the mathematician in the musician remained . " anything that 's put together with care and precision involves measurement and that 's also true in music , " said iyer .
" you have measurements of time and measurements of frequency or pitch , to perceive music is to perceive order in sound , so when you 're talking about mathematics in music , you 're talking about ordering events . " the trio 's album combines mathematical with spiritual and emotional elements - which iyer said do n't contradict each other but have always coexisted in music . the bedrock of jazz this synthesis of mathematical perfection and deep spirituality has underpinned vijay iyer 's works since the late 1990s .
he has composed for orchestras and string quartets and written ballet scores and movie soundtracks , but his heart belongs to jazz in general and his echo-award-winning trio in particular . for iyer , the genre of the piano trio has been an elemental force in the development of jazz music . " it 's something so deeply explored by so many masters , especially the pianist-composers like duke ellington or herbie nichols - people who had a vision of how music can sound , " said iyer .
" i 'm not caught up in displaying my own virtuosity but i 'm interested in projecting a unity of intent and that 's something the trio can offer . " that " unity of intent " may be difficult to define but is highly apparent when listening to the trio 's music .
vijay iyer is the composer and frontman , but when the band performs , he does not regard himself as a conductor in the classical sense .
improvisation is the life-blood of jazz , he said , but this has to be given a structure created by the composer . " most of the time , when i 'm composing , i 'm setting up a situation for things to happen , so it 's more like architecture , in the sense that i want people to move around in it , " said iyer , " i want people to live and stretch out and be free inside of the space that i 've created . " the audience as a creative force when the vijay iyer trio takes the stage wednesday evening in bochum to pick up the first-ever echo for the best international jazz ensemble , the band says it will be sharing the award with a huge though nameless creative force that has always been behind it : its audiences on both sides of the atlantic . vijay iyer highlighted that the trio is not making music for itself in an aesthetic vacuum , but aims above all to connect with the listeners . " this is something i think is inherent to jazz in particular because there 's so much improvisation involved , there 's really a sense that the music is being created just for that moment and not just for its own sake but for the force of communication and connection , " said the musician . " the more we get back from the audience , the more it impels us to push ourselves and explore and create .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 05.05.2010 biden speech could set the record straight on eu-us relations , say legislators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the expectations are high for joe biden 's speech in brussels in what the white house has billed a major address , us vice president biden will speak at the european parliament on thursday .
members of parliament hope that he will reaffirm us-eu ties - and patch up a few things . members of the european parliament should highlight february 11 , 2010 in their calendars .
it was on that thursday a couple of months ago that they and their institution for the first time appeared in earnest on the radar of most us politicians .
prior to that day and their overwhelming , cross-party rejection of the transfer of financial data to the us under the so-called swift agreement , the european parliament and its work went largely unnoticed in washington .
the swift veto that has left eu and us officials scrambling since then for a replacement agreement served as a wake-up call that a new player with real power had emerged on europe 's political landscape .
that 's certainly true , says elmar brok , chairman of the european parliament delegation with the us and a leading member of the european people 's party .
he adds that washington has realized that the legislature does n't only have overall codecison powers , but also that parliament has to ratify all third country agreements and treaties of the eu .
the message was that in effect , says brok , " nothing can be decided at the end of the day against the will of the european parliament . "
unusual business joe biden 's speech before the european parliament therefore should also be viewed against the backdrop of the body 's newly asserted role .
" it is indeed not everyday business that the vice president of the united states would visit the european parliament and in a way i think the obama administration is paying tribute to the newly enhanced role of the parliament , " says reinhard buetikofer , a member of the delegation with the us and vice-chair of the greens in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament 's veto of the swift agreement put it on the map in washington what 's more , argue brok and buetikofer , biden 's brussel 's speech can serve as an important signal of cooperation between the us and the eu after president barack obama 's decision to cancel his participation in the upcoming bilateral summit in madrid caused some consternation in europe .
buetikofer also hopes that biden , a former senator with vast experience in foreign relations , will set the record straight on europe 's contribution to international security .
refering to a speech us secretary of state hillary clinton gave earlier this year in paris , buetikofer says he was surprised that clinton did n't mention europe 's common foreign and security policy at all .
" so people have wondered , including myself , whether the european contribution to europe 's security , the european engagement in missions like atalanta -lrb- the eu 's anti-piracy operation off the coast of somalia - ed . -rrb- , are at all on the screen in washington . "
so while biden could clearly patch up a few things in european-american affairs , relations between the european parliament and its us counterpart are on a good track since the swift vote . reinvigorate transatlantic dialogue " when we spoke to members of congress in march they explained that the speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , had decided to upgrade the status of the transatlantic legislators dialogue -lrb- tld -rrb- within congress , " says buetikofer .
the tld is a long-standing debate forum for european and us parlamentarians that has effectively been in a deep slumber since its inception - mostly due to a lack of interest from the american side .
now , says brok , is the time to wake it up .
" we have to strengthen the transatlantic legislators dialogue .
we have to work on that in the future and have closer relationships with committees and rapporteurs concerned in order to avoid that we legislate in the us congress or in the european parliament in a way that goes in different directions which would be unhelpful for both sides . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : house speaker nancy pelosi supports stronger ties to european legislators while the house of representatives under the leadership of nancy pelosi has already understood the importance of closer cooperation with european parliamentarians , the us senate is still more reluctant , say brok and buetikofer .
both eu parliamentarians emphasize that striving for closer ties with the us does n't negate reaching out to other countries as well . " however we do see a clear agenda with regard to the transatlantic relationship and it needs some attention , " says buetikofer .
" we should n't let that slip away , just because we believe that asia is coming up strong and that we should also pay attention to that .
i think the parliament has the power and the vision to do both . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 05.05.2010 new york trio picks up germany 's first echo award for jazz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vijay iyer trio are pioneers for the echo jazz award the german echo awards , like the grammys , are among the world 's most prestigious music prizes .
on may 5 , the first-ever echo for jazz is awarded to the vijay iyer trio from new york . it 's the first time the german record industry will present the echo distinctions - until now monopolized by the pop and classical sectors - for jazz , a genre which has been growing in popularity over the past few years . the vijay iyer trio , with stephan crump on bass , marcus gilmore on drums and bandleader vijay iyer on piano , rocked the jazz scene last fall with their new album " historicity . "
it was hailed by critics on both sides of the atlantic as the best jazz cd of 2009 . still , the band was surprised to be selected for the jazz echo award just months later .
they were n't only selected by an expert jury , but also by the music-loving public as reflected in record and down-load sales . " it 's nice to know that there is both a critical embrace and an audience embrace sort of working together , " said iyer . from math to music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iyer links the rational with the emotional in his music band founder vijay iyer is multi-talented .
born the son of indian immigrants to the us , he grew up playing classical violin .
he studied mathematics and physics at yale university and graduated from the university of california at berkeley with a doctorate in arts and technology . during his student days he started playing piano , jammed in jazz clubs , and began exploring composition .
for him , music became the powerhouse of creativity and the means of self-expression that he had been searching for .
but the mathematician in the musician remained . " anything that 's put together with care and precision involves measurement and that 's also true in music , " said iyer .
" you have measurements of time and measurements of frequency or pitch , to perceive music is to perceive order in sound , so when you 're talking about mathematics in music , you 're talking about ordering events . " the trio 's album combines mathematical with spiritual and emotional elements - which iyer said do n't contradict each other but have always coexisted in music . the bedrock of jazz this synthesis of mathematical perfection and deep spirituality has underpinned vijay iyer 's works since the late 1990s .
he has composed for orchestras and string quartets and written ballet scores and movie soundtracks , but his heart belongs to jazz in general and his echo-award-winning trio in particular . for iyer , the genre of the piano trio has been an elemental force in the development of jazz music . " it 's something so deeply explored by so many masters , especially the pianist-composers like duke ellington or herbie nichols - people who had a vision of how music can sound , " said iyer .
" i 'm not caught up in displaying my own virtuosity but i 'm interested in projecting a unity of intent and that 's something the trio can offer . " that " unity of intent " may be difficult to define but is highly apparent when listening to the trio 's music .
vijay iyer is the composer and frontman , but when the band performs , he does not regard himself as a conductor in the classical sense .
improvisation is the life-blood of jazz , he said , but this has to be given a structure created by the composer . " most of the time , when i 'm composing , i 'm setting up a situation for things to happen , so it 's more like architecture , in the sense that i want people to move around in it , " said iyer , " i want people to live and stretch out and be free inside of the space that i 've created . " the audience as a creative force when the vijay iyer trio takes the stage wednesday evening in bochum to pick up the first-ever echo for the best international jazz ensemble , the band says it will be sharing the award with a huge though nameless creative force that has always been behind it : its audiences on both sides of the atlantic . vijay iyer highlighted that the trio is not making music for itself in an aesthetic vacuum , but aims above all to connect with the listeners . " this is something i think is inherent to jazz in particular because there 's so much improvisation involved , there 's really a sense that the music is being created just for that moment and not just for its own sake but for the force of communication and connection , " said the musician . " the more we get back from the audience , the more it impels us to push ourselves and explore and create .

rioters threw petrol bombs and stones in a bid to storm parliament , while police used tear gas . at least three people are reported dead as protests in athens turned violent on wednesday .
fire officials in athens revealed that bodies had been found in the bank building , which lay on the route of a march against government austerity cuts . " we have found three dead people in the building that is on fire , " the fire brigade said . police said that some 20 people were evacuated from the building , a branch of the marfin bank group , after it was set alight by protesters . two women and one man had died , police said , with five people from the bank wounded .
the bank was engulfed in flames when hooded youths threw petrol bombs during the demonstrations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek prime minister george papandreou condemned the killings officials said that two government buildings had also been set alight .
parliament , which was meeting when the incident took place , held a minute of silence for the dead .
prime minister george papandreou condemned the killings as a " murderous act . " eu president herman van rompuy insisted it was " extremely important " that the greek government impose the austerity measures but voiced sympathy over the deaths .
" our first thoughts today turn to the victims in athens , " he said . while the right to protest remained sacred , president of the european commission jose manuel barroso said , " nothing can justify the recourse to violence . "
nationwide clashes police clashed with protesters in both the capital and the northern city of thessaloniki , with tens of thousands of greeks marching against the government ’ s harsh new spending cuts amid a nationwide strike .
at least 50 people tried to storm the parliament building in athens , throwing rocks at police who responded with tear gas and stun grenades .
police estimated the crowd size to be more than 25,000 , though other media reports put the number as high as 60,000 .
in thessaloniki , youths smashed the windows of stores and fast food restaurants as 20,000 people marched through the city center .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-communist protesters shouted slogans outside the parliament the nationwide strike brought greece to a standstill as unions rallied against major new spending cuts aimed at warding off a financial meltdown .

the acropolis and other ancient sites were also to remain closed .
greece 's main unions met in central athens at 11 a.m. local time before heading off on protest marches through the streets of the capital .
more than 1,500 police were expected to be on duty .
on saturday , may day marches resulted in clashes between anarchists and police .
hundreds of thousands of civil servants kicked off the demonstrations on tuesday , protesting against the latest round of spending cuts and tax hikes announced on the weekend .
the government agreed to the latest austerity package in return for the promise of a bailout of 110 billion euros -lrb- $ 142.8 billion -rrb- in loans over three years from eurozone countries and the international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chanceller angela merkel has defended the bailout wednesday 's general strike is the third in as many months , and comes as parliament is expected to pass the austerity package on thursday .
markets remain unconvinced financial markets fell sharply on tuesday , seemingly unconvinced that greece 's bailout package will be enough to stop the spread of the financial crisis to other weak eurozone economies in ireland , portugal and spain .
" there is always a risk of contagion , " said dominique strauss-kahn , the head of the international monetary fund , in an interview with french daily le parisien on wednesday .
" portugal has been mentioned , but it is already taking measures and the other countries are in a much more solid situation .
we have to succeed in avoiding contagion ... but we should remain vigilant . "
the euro fell to a one-year low on wednesday , trading at 77 cents against the us dollar. cmk / rc / afp / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 05.05.2010 biden speech could set the record straight on eu-us relations , say legislators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the expectations are high for joe biden 's speech in brussels in what the white house has billed a major address , us vice president biden will speak at the european parliament on thursday .
members of parliament hope that he will reaffirm us-eu ties - and patch up a few things . members of the european parliament should highlight february 11 , 2010 in their calendars .
it was on that thursday a couple of months ago that they and their institution for the first time appeared in earnest on the radar of most us politicians .
prior to that day and their overwhelming , cross-party rejection of the transfer of financial data to the us under the so-called swift agreement , the european parliament and its work went largely unnoticed in washington .
the swift veto that has left eu and us officials scrambling since then for a replacement agreement served as a wake-up call that a new player with real power had emerged on europe 's political landscape .
that 's certainly true , says elmar brok , chairman of the european parliament delegation with the us and a leading member of the european people 's party .
he adds that washington has realized that the legislature does n't only have overall codecison powers , but also that parliament has to ratify all third country agreements and treaties of the eu .
the message was that in effect , says brok , " nothing can be decided at the end of the day against the will of the european parliament . "
unusual business joe biden 's speech before the european parliament therefore should also be viewed against the backdrop of the body 's newly asserted role .
" it is indeed not everyday business that the vice president of the united states would visit the european parliament and in a way i think the obama administration is paying tribute to the newly enhanced role of the parliament , " says reinhard buetikofer , a member of the delegation with the us and vice-chair of the greens in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament 's veto of the swift agreement put it on the map in washington what 's more , argue brok and buetikofer , biden 's brussel 's speech can serve as an important signal of cooperation between the us and the eu after president barack obama 's decision to cancel his participation in the upcoming bilateral summit in madrid caused some consternation in europe .
buetikofer also hopes that biden , a former senator with vast experience in foreign relations , will set the record straight on europe 's contribution to international security .
refering to a speech us secretary of state hillary clinton gave earlier this year in paris , buetikofer says he was surprised that clinton did n't mention europe 's common foreign and security policy at all .
" so people have wondered , including myself , whether the european contribution to europe 's security , the european engagement in missions like atalanta -lrb- the eu 's anti-piracy operation off the coast of somalia - ed . -rrb- , are at all on the screen in washington . "
so while biden could clearly patch up a few things in european-american affairs , relations between the european parliament and its us counterpart are on a good track since the swift vote . reinvigorate transatlantic dialogue " when we spoke to members of congress in march they explained that the speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , had decided to upgrade the status of the transatlantic legislators dialogue -lrb- tld -rrb- within congress , " says buetikofer .
the tld is a long-standing debate forum for european and us parlamentarians that has effectively been in a deep slumber since its inception - mostly due to a lack of interest from the american side .
now , says brok , is the time to wake it up .
" we have to strengthen the transatlantic legislators dialogue .
we have to work on that in the future and have closer relationships with committees and rapporteurs concerned in order to avoid that we legislate in the us congress or in the european parliament in a way that goes in different directions which would be unhelpful for both sides . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : house speaker nancy pelosi supports stronger ties to european legislators while the house of representatives under the leadership of nancy pelosi has already understood the importance of closer cooperation with european parliamentarians , the us senate is still more reluctant , say brok and buetikofer .
both eu parliamentarians emphasize that striving for closer ties with the us does n't negate reaching out to other countries as well . " however we do see a clear agenda with regard to the transatlantic relationship and it needs some attention , " says buetikofer .
" we should n't let that slip away , just because we believe that asia is coming up strong and that we should also pay attention to that .
i think the parliament has the power and the vision to do both . "

petrauskas believes radical and violent groups are organizing protests and provocations against the participants of the gay march .
police reaction the police , however , say that they have enough manpower to ensure security .
around 800 police officers were supposed to protect the marchers .
president dalia grybauskaite said she was astounded by what she calls a failure of communication between two of the country 's institutions .
" the bodies responsible for public order , above all the police , have an obligation to ensure a situation remains calm and there are no clashes , " her spokesperson said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania 's president says she is shocked by the court 's decision .
the organizers of the march are shocked by the decision and have applied for an appeal .
but there is next to no chance the appeal can be heard before saturday .
one of the organizers , arturas rudomanskis from the tolerant youth association , says sexual minorities have a constitutional right to peaceful assembly and it is the police who are to blame if they can not guarantee that right . "
i think the president should look carefully to see if she has chosen the right person for the prosecutors office , " rudomanskis told deutsche welle .
" lithuania was able to protect the us president during his visit here and also the british queen .
so why ca n't the country assure the safety of a peaceful meeting by its own citizens ? " he added .
amnesty international has also condemned the court 's decision , saying that it violates human rights .
" the authorities in lithuania must ensure that the march goes ahead unobstructed and safely as they are obliged under international law to guarantee the rights to freedom to expression and assembly , " john dalhuisen , amnesty international 's expert on discrimination in europe said in a statement .
march part of a five-day festival the gay pride parade was only one event in a five-day festival on the subject of equal rights for sexual minorities .
however , the march has sparked a fierce public debate in staunchly catholic lithunia .
several anti-gay protests have been organized and a group of members of parliament has filed a petition against the march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral of vilnius represents the country 's catholic heritage members of the clergy are among the most outspoken critics , insisting that the most important thing is to protect lithuanian families .
" imagine all those wrongdoers in vilnius .
they want to show that their law is above everything .
above the ten commandments , above god , above the history of our nation , " alfonsas svarinskas , a priest , told deutsche welle .
it would have been the first ever gay pride parade in vilnius .
previous attempts to organize gay pride marches were banned by local authorities .
according to a recent eurobarometer survey , lithuanians are the least aware in the european union of the possibility that they may have homosexuals in their own families .

but the path leading to the bailout has been rocky , and some blame chancellor merkel . at the start of a day of debate in the german parliament about the european union financial bailout for greece , chancellor angela merkel made one thing clear in an address to the bundestag . " this is about nothing less than the future of europe and the future of germany in europe , " merkel said about the decision for germany to back a rescue package for greece . merkel has found herself needing to defend her about-face on sending help to athens .
initially , merkel was against a greek bailout .
however as pressure built from the rest of the european union , merkel changed her tune .
now , legislation to approve 22.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- is up for a vote in the bundestag .
germany 's contribution is part of a three-year , 120-billion-euro bailout from the eu and the international monetary fund . all of the conditions germany had set for approving a bailout package had been fulfilled , merkel told parliamentarians . first and foremost was a consolidation plan for greece to get its out-of-control budget back on track , and close behind was the involvement of the imf , which is to contribute 30 billion euros to the total package . greece 's daunting task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she believed papandreou would keep his country on track with its saving merkel justified her decision to hold back her approval of the bailout package until germany could be absolutely sure greece had met all of the pre-conditions . " without sufficient consideration to preconditions , " merkel said , " the expectations of other deeply indebted members of the eurozone that they would quickly receive help without their own consolidation efforts would have risen . " as public and private sector strikes continued in greece against the government 's proposed efforts to cut back spending , merkel expressed her confidence in athens to keep to its word . i trust that my greek counterpart , prime minster -lrb- george -rrb- papandreou , will carry out this program , no matter how daunting it may be . " devil in the details although all the parties in the german government generally agree that a bailout for greece is necessary , not everyone is happy with how merkel and her coalition government handled the situation . the parliamentary party leader of the opposition social democrats , frank-walter steinmeier , agreed that greece was in need of german and european help .
but he said his party would not agree to a blank check for greece , citing a rift between the coalition government and the opposition on the details . " it would be nice if there were n't galaxies and light years between the parties in such an important decision , " steinmeier added . by continuing to put off the decision on whether or not germany was on board with a greek bailout , merkel 's critics say the situation was exacerbated , putting unnecessary strain on the eurozone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is set to vote on a greek bailout by friday merkel 's cold feet ? gregor gysi , head of the left party in parliament , accused merkel of repeating her performance in dealing with the global financial crisis , when chancellor merkel 's government agreed to billions in bailouts for german-based banks . " we told you then that debt crises could hit entire nations , " gysi said .
" now what is happening in greece is threatening other countries , such as ireland , italy , spain and portugal .
every time , you put your hands on your lap and do nothing initially , only to turn around and make billions available later , just like back then with the banks . " the german parliament is expected to pass the bailout bill by friday , ahead of a crucial may 9 debt deadline for greece . mz / dpa / afpe editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 05.05.2010 biden speech could set the record straight on eu-us relations , say legislators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the expectations are high for joe biden 's speech in brussels in what the white house has billed a major address , us vice president biden will speak at the european parliament on thursday .
members of parliament hope that he will reaffirm us-eu ties - and patch up a few things . members of the european parliament should highlight february 11 , 2010 in their calendars .
it was on that thursday a couple of months ago that they and their institution for the first time appeared in earnest on the radar of most us politicians .
prior to that day and their overwhelming , cross-party rejection of the transfer of financial data to the us under the so-called swift agreement , the european parliament and its work went largely unnoticed in washington .
the swift veto that has left eu and us officials scrambling since then for a replacement agreement served as a wake-up call that a new player with real power had emerged on europe 's political landscape .
that 's certainly true , says elmar brok , chairman of the european parliament delegation with the us and a leading member of the european people 's party .
he adds that washington has realized that the legislature does n't only have overall codecison powers , but also that parliament has to ratify all third country agreements and treaties of the eu .
the message was that in effect , says brok , " nothing can be decided at the end of the day against the will of the european parliament . "
unusual business joe biden 's speech before the european parliament therefore should also be viewed against the backdrop of the body 's newly asserted role .
" it is indeed not everyday business that the vice president of the united states would visit the european parliament and in a way i think the obama administration is paying tribute to the newly enhanced role of the parliament , " says reinhard buetikofer , a member of the delegation with the us and vice-chair of the greens in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament 's veto of the swift agreement put it on the map in washington what 's more , argue brok and buetikofer , biden 's brussel 's speech can serve as an important signal of cooperation between the us and the eu after president barack obama 's decision to cancel his participation in the upcoming bilateral summit in madrid caused some consternation in europe .
buetikofer also hopes that biden , a former senator with vast experience in foreign relations , will set the record straight on europe 's contribution to international security .
refering to a speech us secretary of state hillary clinton gave earlier this year in paris , buetikofer says he was surprised that clinton did n't mention europe 's common foreign and security policy at all .
" so people have wondered , including myself , whether the european contribution to europe 's security , the european engagement in missions like atalanta -lrb- the eu 's anti-piracy operation off the coast of somalia - ed . -rrb- , are at all on the screen in washington . "
so while biden could clearly patch up a few things in european-american affairs , relations between the european parliament and its us counterpart are on a good track since the swift vote . reinvigorate transatlantic dialogue " when we spoke to members of congress in march they explained that the speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , had decided to upgrade the status of the transatlantic legislators dialogue -lrb- tld -rrb- within congress , " says buetikofer .
the tld is a long-standing debate forum for european and us parlamentarians that has effectively been in a deep slumber since its inception - mostly due to a lack of interest from the american side .
now , says brok , is the time to wake it up .
" we have to strengthen the transatlantic legislators dialogue .
we have to work on that in the future and have closer relationships with committees and rapporteurs concerned in order to avoid that we legislate in the us congress or in the european parliament in a way that goes in different directions which would be unhelpful for both sides . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : house speaker nancy pelosi supports stronger ties to european legislators while the house of representatives under the leadership of nancy pelosi has already understood the importance of closer cooperation with european parliamentarians , the us senate is still more reluctant , say brok and buetikofer .
both eu parliamentarians emphasize that striving for closer ties with the us does n't negate reaching out to other countries as well . " however we do see a clear agenda with regard to the transatlantic relationship and it needs some attention , " says buetikofer .
" we should n't let that slip away , just because we believe that asia is coming up strong and that we should also pay attention to that .
i think the parliament has the power and the vision to do both . "

they could claim anything to blame us pakistanis for acts of terror . "
a business man is of the opinion : " as long as the usa keeps getting involved in our affairs , the taliban will stay involved in theirs . "
among the pakistani people there is a sense of deep animosity towards america and a feeling of being victimized .

faisal shahzad is an american citizen of pakistani origin . faisal shahzad has apparently confessed to planting the bomb in times square , but in his home country , pakistan , the reactions vary : some are skeptical and some are in denial . one accountant from karachi is in disbelief : " what evidence do the americans have ?
they could claim anything to blame us pakistanis for acts of terror . "
a business man is of the opinion : " as long as the usa keeps getting involved in our affairs , the taliban will stay involved in theirs . "
among the pakistani people there is a sense of deep animosity towards america and a feeling of being victimized .
nonetheless the pakistani police has arrested numerous people in connection with the attempted attack in new york .
now authorities are working on finding out if faisal shahzad was acting alone or if he was working for a pakistani terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shahzad was taken into custody on monday while trying to board a flight to dubai bomb making classes in pakistan shahzad has reportedly stated he was trained in bomb-making in his home country .
according to statements made by his mother , last year he spent time in northwest pakistan , a stronghold of islamist insurgents .
the group that confessed to the attack is known as the " tehrik-e-taliban pakistan " , but it is still not clear whether or not they are really responsible .
until now they have mainly carried out attacks in pakistan .
but in another video , the leader of the terrorist group , hakimullah mehsud , recently threatened to carry out attacks in american cities .
mehsud was also filmed with a jordanian al qaeda terrorist who was responsible for the deaths of seven cia agents last year in khost , afghanistan .
terrorism beyond the borders so it would seem that tehrik-e-taliban pakistan is looking to expand terrorist activities beyond pakistani borders .
the prohibited group lashkar-e-taiba -lrb- let for short -rrb- is another terrorist group that went beyond the borders .
now it is said they are operating through dummy organizations .
in 2008 they organized the terror attacks in mumbai , in which 175 people were killed .
however , a speaker of the group denies any involvement , stating : neither lashkar-e-taiba nor its founder , hafiz saeed , have anything to do with the mumbai attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombproof courtroom in a mumbai jail where ajmal kasab is being tried but evidence from the trial of the only surviving attacker , ajmal kasab , has proven otherwise .
kasab described in great detail how lashkar-e-taiba recruited and trained him and then sent him to mumbai .
before that , the group had carried out other attacks in india , among them on the indian parliament in delhi .
experts also believe that let was planning to carry out an attack on the american embassy in bangladesh in november .
furthermore , david headley , who is currently imprisoned in the united states and , like shahzad , is of pakistani descent , had also been planning attacks on offices and employees of the danish newspaper " jyllands posten " for the let .
the newspaper had become controversial for the printing of cartoons of the prophet muhammad .
ajmal kasab , the mumbai terrorist , was found guilty of all 86 charges in a court in mumbai on monday .
the sentence is due on thursday ; prosecution has called for capital punishment of the 22 -year-old .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 05.05.2010 biden speech could set the record straight on eu-us relations , say legislators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the expectations are high for joe biden 's speech in brussels in what the white house has billed a major address , us vice president biden will speak at the european parliament on thursday .
members of parliament hope that he will reaffirm us-eu ties - and patch up a few things . members of the european parliament should highlight february 11 , 2010 in their calendars .
it was on that thursday a couple of months ago that they and their institution for the first time appeared in earnest on the radar of most us politicians .
prior to that day and their overwhelming , cross-party rejection of the transfer of financial data to the us under the so-called swift agreement , the european parliament and its work went largely unnoticed in washington .
the swift veto that has left eu and us officials scrambling since then for a replacement agreement served as a wake-up call that a new player with real power had emerged on europe 's political landscape .
that 's certainly true , says elmar brok , chairman of the european parliament delegation with the us and a leading member of the european people 's party .
he adds that washington has realized that the legislature does n't only have overall codecison powers , but also that parliament has to ratify all third country agreements and treaties of the eu .
the message was that in effect , says brok , " nothing can be decided at the end of the day against the will of the european parliament . "
unusual business joe biden 's speech before the european parliament therefore should also be viewed against the backdrop of the body 's newly asserted role .
" it is indeed not everyday business that the vice president of the united states would visit the european parliament and in a way i think the obama administration is paying tribute to the newly enhanced role of the parliament , " says reinhard buetikofer , a member of the delegation with the us and vice-chair of the greens in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament 's veto of the swift agreement put it on the map in washington what 's more , argue brok and buetikofer , biden 's brussel 's speech can serve as an important signal of cooperation between the us and the eu after president barack obama 's decision to cancel his participation in the upcoming bilateral summit in madrid caused some consternation in europe .
buetikofer also hopes that biden , a former senator with vast experience in foreign relations , will set the record straight on europe 's contribution to international security .
refering to a speech us secretary of state hillary clinton gave earlier this year in paris , buetikofer says he was surprised that clinton did n't mention europe 's common foreign and security policy at all .
" so people have wondered , including myself , whether the european contribution to europe 's security , the european engagement in missions like atalanta -lrb- the eu 's anti-piracy operation off the coast of somalia - ed . -rrb- , are at all on the screen in washington . "
so while biden could clearly patch up a few things in european-american affairs , relations between the european parliament and its us counterpart are on a good track since the swift vote . reinvigorate transatlantic dialogue " when we spoke to members of congress in march they explained that the speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , had decided to upgrade the status of the transatlantic legislators dialogue -lrb- tld -rrb- within congress , " says buetikofer .
the tld is a long-standing debate forum for european and us parlamentarians that has effectively been in a deep slumber since its inception - mostly due to a lack of interest from the american side .
now , says brok , is the time to wake it up .
" we have to strengthen the transatlantic legislators dialogue .
we have to work on that in the future and have closer relationships with committees and rapporteurs concerned in order to avoid that we legislate in the us congress or in the european parliament in a way that goes in different directions which would be unhelpful for both sides . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : house speaker nancy pelosi supports stronger ties to european legislators while the house of representatives under the leadership of nancy pelosi has already understood the importance of closer cooperation with european parliamentarians , the us senate is still more reluctant , say brok and buetikofer .
both eu parliamentarians emphasize that striving for closer ties with the us does n't negate reaching out to other countries as well . " however we do see a clear agenda with regard to the transatlantic relationship and it needs some attention , " says buetikofer .
" we should n't let that slip away , just because we believe that asia is coming up strong and that we should also pay attention to that .
i think the parliament has the power and the vision to do both . "

rioters threw petrol bombs and stones in a bid to storm parliament , while police used tear gas . at least three people are reported dead as protests in athens turned violent on wednesday .
fire officials in athens revealed that bodies had been found in the bank building , which lay on the route of a march against government austerity cuts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 05.05.2010 biden speech could set the record straight on eu-us relations , say legislators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the expectations are high for joe biden 's speech in brussels in what the white house has billed a major address , us vice president biden will speak at the european parliament on thursday .
members of parliament hope that he will reaffirm us-eu ties - and patch up a few things . members of the european parliament should highlight february 11 , 2010 in their calendars .
it was on that thursday a couple of months ago that they and their institution for the first time appeared in earnest on the radar of most us politicians .
prior to that day and their overwhelming , cross-party rejection of the transfer of financial data to the us under the so-called swift agreement , the european parliament and its work went largely unnoticed in washington .
the swift veto that has left eu and us officials scrambling since then for a replacement agreement served as a wake-up call that a new player with real power had emerged on europe 's political landscape .
that 's certainly true , says elmar brok , chairman of the european parliament delegation with the us and a leading member of the european people 's party .
he adds that washington has realized that the legislature does n't only have overall codecison powers , but also that parliament has to ratify all third country agreements and treaties of the eu .
the message was that in effect , says brok , " nothing can be decided at the end of the day against the will of the european parliament . "
unusual business joe biden 's speech before the european parliament therefore should also be viewed against the backdrop of the body 's newly asserted role .
" it is indeed not everyday business that the vice president of the united states would visit the european parliament and in a way i think the obama administration is paying tribute to the newly enhanced role of the parliament , " says reinhard buetikofer , a member of the delegation with the us and vice-chair of the greens in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament 's veto of the swift agreement put it on the map in washington what 's more , argue brok and buetikofer , biden 's brussel 's speech can serve as an important signal of cooperation between the us and the eu after president barack obama 's decision to cancel his participation in the upcoming bilateral summit in madrid caused some consternation in europe .
buetikofer also hopes that biden , a former senator with vast experience in foreign relations , will set the record straight on europe 's contribution to international security .
refering to a speech us secretary of state hillary clinton gave earlier this year in paris , buetikofer says he was surprised that clinton did n't mention europe 's common foreign and security policy at all .
" so people have wondered , including myself , whether the european contribution to europe 's security , the european engagement in missions like atalanta -lrb- the eu 's anti-piracy operation off the coast of somalia - ed . -rrb- , are at all on the screen in washington . "
so while biden could clearly patch up a few things in european-american affairs , relations between the european parliament and its us counterpart are on a good track since the swift vote . reinvigorate transatlantic dialogue " when we spoke to members of congress in march they explained that the speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , had decided to upgrade the status of the transatlantic legislators dialogue -lrb- tld -rrb- within congress , " says buetikofer .
the tld is a long-standing debate forum for european and us parlamentarians that has effectively been in a deep slumber since its inception - mostly due to a lack of interest from the american side .
now , says brok , is the time to wake it up .
" we have to strengthen the transatlantic legislators dialogue .
we have to work on that in the future and have closer relationships with committees and rapporteurs concerned in order to avoid that we legislate in the us congress or in the european parliament in a way that goes in different directions which would be unhelpful for both sides . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : house speaker nancy pelosi supports stronger ties to european legislators while the house of representatives under the leadership of nancy pelosi has already understood the importance of closer cooperation with european parliamentarians , the us senate is still more reluctant , say brok and buetikofer .
both eu parliamentarians emphasize that striving for closer ties with the us does n't negate reaching out to other countries as well . " however we do see a clear agenda with regard to the transatlantic relationship and it needs some attention , " says buetikofer .
" we should n't let that slip away , just because we believe that asia is coming up strong and that we should also pay attention to that .
i think the parliament has the power and the vision to do both . "

faisal shahzad is an american citizen of pakistani origin . faisal shahzad has apparently confessed to planting the bomb in times square , but in his home country , pakistan , the reactions vary : some are skeptical and some are in denial . one accountant from karachi is in disbelief : " what evidence do the americans have ?
they could claim anything to blame us pakistanis for acts of terror . "
a business man is of the opinion : " as long as the usa keeps getting involved in our affairs , the taliban will stay involved in theirs . "
among the pakistani people there is a sense of deep animosity towards america and a feeling of being victimized .
nonetheless the pakistani police has arrested numerous people in connection with the attempted attack in new york .
now authorities are working on finding out if faisal shahzad was acting alone or if he was working for a pakistani terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shahzad was taken into custody on monday while trying to board a flight to dubai bomb making classes in pakistan shahzad has reportedly stated he was trained in bomb-making in his home country .
according to statements made by his mother , last year he spent time in northwest pakistan , a stronghold of islamist insurgents .
the group that confessed to the attack is known as the " tehrik-e-taliban pakistan " , but it is still not clear whether or not they are really responsible .
until now they have mainly carried out attacks in pakistan .
but in another video , the leader of the terrorist group , hakimullah mehsud , recently threatened to carry out attacks in american cities .
mehsud was also filmed with a jordanian al qaeda terrorist who was responsible for the deaths of seven cia agents last year in khost , afghanistan .
terrorism beyond the borders so it would seem that tehrik-e-taliban pakistan is looking to expand terrorist activities beyond pakistani borders .
the prohibited group lashkar-e-taiba -lrb- let for short -rrb- is another terrorist group that went beyond the borders .
now it is said they are operating through dummy organizations .
in 2008 they organized the terror attacks in mumbai , in which 175 people were killed .
however , a speaker of the group denies any involvement , stating : neither lashkar-e-taiba nor its founder , hafiz saeed , have anything to do with the mumbai attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombproof courtroom in a mumbai jail where ajmal kasab is being tried but evidence from the trial of the only surviving attacker , ajmal kasab , has proven otherwise .
kasab described in great detail how lashkar-e-taiba recruited and trained him and then sent him to mumbai .
before that , the group had carried out other attacks in india , among them on the indian parliament in delhi .
experts also believe that let was planning to carry out an attack on the american embassy in bangladesh in november .
furthermore , david headley , who is currently imprisoned in the united states and , like shahzad , is of pakistani descent , had also been planning attacks on offices and employees of the danish newspaper " jyllands posten " for the let .
the newspaper had become controversial for the printing of cartoons of the prophet muhammad .
ajmal kasab , the mumbai terrorist , was found guilty of all 86 charges in a court in mumbai on monday .
the sentence is due on thursday ; prosecution has called for capital punishment of the 22 -year-old .

however , the disruption looks set to be far less than last month 's . a fresh volcanic ash cloud forced british and irish air traffic authorities to close parts of their airspace on wednesday , as iceland 's eyjafjallajoekull volcano continued to disrupt european flight paths .
a drifting cloud of ash from the volcano led to flights being halted across most of the continent for almost a week in april .
britain 's civil aviation authority -lrb- caa -rrb- said late on tuesday that air traffic to and from three airports in scotland , including glasgow , would not be allowed as of 6 a.m. gmt wednesday .
the airport in edinburgh , scotland ’ s capital , remained open until midday .
belfast 's airport , in northern ireland , was also closed and flights to and from dublin in the republic of ireland were shut down from 10 a.m.
the irish aviation authority said all airports in ireland could be affected by early afternoon .
" forecasts show that levels of ash in the atmosphere over scotland and northern ireland will exceed the concentrations that engine manufacturers have agreed are safe for operations , " the caa said in a statement .
ash from iceland had caused a similar closure in the same areas from monday until the middle of tuesday this week .
both irish and british authorities fear the volcanic ash , which can damage aircraft engines and instruments when present in large quantities , will spread south during the day , perhaps causing further airport closures in the north of england .
smaller disruptions however , the caa said there was no imminent threat to britain ’ s busiest southern airports , like london 's heathrow and gatwick .
the primary ash cloud from eyjafjallajoekull 's eruption in april brought the majority of european air travel to a standstill for six days , leaving millions of travellers stranded and costing airlines and industry hundreds of millions of euros .
at a meeting on tuesday , european union transport ministers agreed the eu should immediately create a unified air traffic group to ensure member states coordinate their reactions to any similar problems in the future , in a bid to minimize disruptions and costs. msh / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 05.05.2010 new york trio picks up germany 's first echo award for jazz großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the vijay iyer trio are pioneers for the echo jazz award the german echo awards , like the grammys , are among the world 's most prestigious music prizes .
on may 5 , the first-ever echo for jazz is awarded to the vijay iyer trio from new york . it 's the first time the german record industry will present the echo distinctions - until now monopolized by the pop and classical sectors - for jazz , a genre which has been growing in popularity over the past few years . the vijay iyer trio , with stephan crump on bass , marcus gilmore on drums and bandleader vijay iyer on piano , rocked the jazz scene last fall with their new album " historicity . "
it was hailed by critics on both sides of the atlantic as the best jazz cd of 2009 . still , the band was surprised to be selected for the jazz echo award just months later .
they were n't only selected by an expert jury , but also by the music-loving public as reflected in record and down-load sales . " it 's nice to know that there is both a critical embrace and an audience embrace sort of working together , " said iyer . from math to music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iyer links the rational with the emotional in his music band founder vijay iyer is multi-talented .
born the son of indian immigrants to the us , he grew up playing classical violin .
he studied mathematics and physics at yale university and graduated from the university of california at berkeley with a doctorate in arts and technology . during his student days he started playing piano , jammed in jazz clubs , and began exploring composition .
for him , music became the powerhouse of creativity and the means of self-expression that he had been searching for .
but the mathematician in the musician remained . " anything that 's put together with care and precision involves measurement and that 's also true in music , " said iyer .
" you have measurements of time and measurements of frequency or pitch , to perceive music is to perceive order in sound , so when you 're talking about mathematics in music , you 're talking about ordering events . " the trio 's album combines mathematical with spiritual and emotional elements - which iyer said do n't contradict each other but have always coexisted in music . the bedrock of jazz this synthesis of mathematical perfection and deep spirituality has underpinned vijay iyer 's works since the late 1990s .
he has composed for orchestras and string quartets and written ballet scores and movie soundtracks , but his heart belongs to jazz in general and his echo-award-winning trio in particular . for iyer , the genre of the piano trio has been an elemental force in the development of jazz music . " it 's something so deeply explored by so many masters , especially the pianist-composers like duke ellington or herbie nichols - people who had a vision of how music can sound , " said iyer .
" i 'm not caught up in displaying my own virtuosity but i 'm interested in projecting a unity of intent and that 's something the trio can offer . " that " unity of intent " may be difficult to define but is highly apparent when listening to the trio 's music .
vijay iyer is the composer and frontman , but when the band performs , he does not regard himself as a conductor in the classical sense .
improvisation is the life-blood of jazz , he said , but this has to be given a structure created by the composer . " most of the time , when i 'm composing , i 'm setting up a situation for things to happen , so it 's more like architecture , in the sense that i want people to move around in it , " said iyer , " i want people to live and stretch out and be free inside of the space that i 've created . " the audience as a creative force when the vijay iyer trio takes the stage wednesday evening in bochum to pick up the first-ever echo for the best international jazz ensemble , the band says it will be sharing the award with a huge though nameless creative force that has always been behind it : its audiences on both sides of the atlantic . vijay iyer highlighted that the trio is not making music for itself in an aesthetic vacuum , but aims above all to connect with the listeners . " this is something i think is inherent to jazz in particular because there 's so much improvisation involved , there 's really a sense that the music is being created just for that moment and not just for its own sake but for the force of communication and connection , " said the musician . " the more we get back from the audience , the more it impels us to push ourselves and explore and create .

on may 5 , the first-ever echo for jazz is awarded to the vijay iyer trio from new york . it 's the first time the german record industry will present the echo distinctions - until now monopolized by the pop and classical sectors - for jazz , a genre which has been growing in popularity over the past few years . the vijay iyer trio , with stephan crump on bass , marcus gilmore on drums and bandleader vijay iyer on piano , rocked the jazz scene last fall with their new album " historicity . "
it was hailed by critics on both sides of the atlantic as the best jazz cd of 2009 . still , the band was surprised to be selected for the jazz echo award just months later .
they were n't only selected by an expert jury , but also by the music-loving public as reflected in record and down-load sales . " it 's nice to know that there is both a critical embrace and an audience embrace sort of working together , " said iyer . from math to music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iyer links the rational with the emotional in his music band founder vijay iyer is multi-talented .
born the son of indian immigrants to the us , he grew up playing classical violin .
he studied mathematics and physics at yale university and graduated from the university of california at berkeley with a doctorate in arts and technology . during his student days he started playing piano , jammed in jazz clubs , and began exploring composition .
for him , music became the powerhouse of creativity and the means of self-expression that he had been searching for .
but the mathematician in the musician remained . " anything that 's put together with care and precision involves measurement and that 's also true in music , " said iyer .
" you have measurements of time and measurements of frequency or pitch , to perceive music is to perceive order in sound , so when you 're talking about mathematics in music , you 're talking about ordering events . " the trio 's album combines mathematical with spiritual and emotional elements - which iyer said do n't contradict each other but have always coexisted in music . the bedrock of jazz this synthesis of mathematical perfection and deep spirituality has underpinned vijay iyer 's works since the late 1990s .
he has composed for orchestras and string quartets and written ballet scores and movie soundtracks , but his heart belongs to jazz in general and his echo-award-winning trio in particular . for iyer , the genre of the piano trio has been an elemental force in the development of jazz music . " it 's something so deeply explored by so many masters , especially the pianist-composers like duke ellington or herbie nichols - people who had a vision of how music can sound , " said iyer .
" i 'm not caught up in displaying my own virtuosity but i 'm interested in projecting a unity of intent and that 's something the trio can offer . " that " unity of intent " may be difficult to define but is highly apparent when listening to the trio 's music .
vijay iyer is the composer and frontman , but when the band performs , he does not regard himself as a conductor in the classical sense .
improvisation is the life-blood of jazz , he said , but this has to be given a structure created by the composer . " most of the time , when i 'm composing , i 'm setting up a situation for things to happen , so it 's more like architecture , in the sense that i want people to move around in it , " said iyer , " i want people to live and stretch out and be free inside of the space that i 've created . " the audience as a creative force when the vijay iyer trio takes the stage wednesday evening in bochum to pick up the first-ever echo for the best international jazz ensemble , the band says it will be sharing the award with a huge though nameless creative force that has always been behind it : its audiences on both sides of the atlantic . vijay iyer highlighted that the trio is not making music for itself in an aesthetic vacuum , but aims above all to connect with the listeners . " this is something i think is inherent to jazz in particular because there 's so much improvisation involved , there 's really a sense that the music is being created just for that moment and not just for its own sake but for the force of communication and connection , " said the musician .

faisal shahzad is an american citizen of pakistani origin . faisal shahzad has apparently confessed to planting the bomb in times square , but in his home country , pakistan , the reactions vary : some are skeptical and some are in denial . one accountant from karachi is in disbelief : " what evidence do the americans have ?
they could claim anything to blame us pakistanis for acts of terror . "
a business man is of the opinion : " as long as the usa keeps getting involved in our affairs , the taliban will stay involved in theirs . "
among the pakistani people there is a sense of deep animosity towards america and a feeling of being victimized .
nonetheless the pakistani police has arrested numerous people in connection with the attempted attack in new york .
now authorities are working on finding out if faisal shahzad was acting alone or if he was working for a pakistani terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shahzad was taken into custody on monday while trying to board a flight to dubai bomb making classes in pakistan shahzad has reportedly stated he was trained in bomb-making in his home country .
according to statements made by his mother , last year he spent time in northwest pakistan , a stronghold of islamist insurgents .
the group that confessed to the attack is known as the " tehrik-e-taliban pakistan " , but it is still not clear whether or not they are really responsible .
until now they have mainly carried out attacks in pakistan .
but in another video , the leader of the terrorist group , hakimullah mehsud , recently threatened to carry out attacks in american cities .
mehsud was also filmed with a jordanian al qaeda terrorist who was responsible for the deaths of seven cia agents last year in khost , afghanistan .
terrorism beyond the borders so it would seem that tehrik-e-taliban pakistan is looking to expand terrorist activities beyond pakistani borders .
the prohibited group lashkar-e-taiba -lrb- let for short -rrb- is another terrorist group that went beyond the borders .
now it is said they are operating through dummy organizations .
in 2008 they organized the terror attacks in mumbai , in which 175 people were killed .
however , a speaker of the group denies any involvement , stating : neither lashkar-e-taiba nor its founder , hafiz saeed , have anything to do with the mumbai attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombproof courtroom in a mumbai jail where ajmal kasab is being tried but evidence from the trial of the only surviving attacker , ajmal kasab , has proven otherwise .
kasab described in great detail how lashkar-e-taiba recruited and trained him and then sent him to mumbai .
before that , the group had carried out other attacks in india , among them on the indian parliament in delhi .
experts also believe that let was planning to carry out an attack on the american embassy in bangladesh in november .
furthermore , david headley , who is currently imprisoned in the united states and , like shahzad , is of pakistani descent , had also been planning attacks on offices and employees of the danish newspaper " jyllands posten " for the let .
the newspaper had become controversial for the printing of cartoons of the prophet muhammad .
ajmal kasab , the mumbai terrorist , was found guilty of all 86 charges in a court in mumbai on monday .
the sentence is due on thursday ; prosecution has called for capital punishment of the 22 -year-old .

the decision has shocked the organizers of the parade and the country 's president . a lithuanian court on wednesday banned a planned gay rights march in a decision which has shocked organizers and the country 's president .
" there 's a constitutional right to peaceful assembly .
if groups of citizens or organisations are n't illegal , they have a right to express their views , " a spokesperson for president dalia grybauskaite told reporters .
the lithuanian attorney general 's office insists security is the only reason it has asked the court to annul a license for what would have been lithuania 's first gay pride march in the capital vilnius .
" whose fault would it be if anyone gets hurt ?
it might look like we are homophobic , but i am not sure if we 'd look better with pictures of violence on tv , " attorney general raimundas petrauskas said .
petrauskas believes radical and violent groups are organizing protests and provocations against the participants of the gay march .
police reaction the police , however , say that they have enough manpower to ensure security .
around 800 police officers were supposed to protect the marchers .
president dalia grybauskaite said she was astounded by what she calls a failure of communication between two of the country 's institutions .
" the bodies responsible for public order , above all the police , have an obligation to ensure a situation remains calm and there are no clashes , " her spokesperson said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania 's president says she is shocked by the court 's decision .
the organizers of the march are shocked by the decision and have applied for an appeal .
but there is next to no chance the appeal can be heard before saturday .
one of the organizers , arturas rudomanskis from the tolerant youth association , says sexual minorities have a constitutional right to peaceful assembly and it is the police who are to blame if they can not guarantee that right . "
i think the president should look carefully to see if she has chosen the right person for the prosecutors office , " rudomanskis told deutsche welle .
" lithuania was able to protect the us president during his visit here and also the british queen .
so why ca n't the country assure the safety of a peaceful meeting by its own citizens ? " he added .
amnesty international has also condemned the court 's decision , saying that it violates human rights .
" the authorities in lithuania must ensure that the march goes ahead unobstructed and safely as they are obliged under international law to guarantee the rights to freedom to expression and assembly , " john dalhuisen , amnesty international 's expert on discrimination in europe said in a statement .
march part of a five-day festival the gay pride parade was only one event in a five-day festival on the subject of equal rights for sexual minorities .
however , the march has sparked a fierce public debate in staunchly catholic lithunia .
several anti-gay protests have been organized and a group of members of parliament has filed a petition against the march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral of vilnius represents the country 's catholic heritage members of the clergy are among the most outspoken critics , insisting that the most important thing is to protect lithuanian families .
" imagine all those wrongdoers in vilnius .
they want to show that their law is above everything .
above the ten commandments , above god , above the history of our nation , " alfonsas svarinskas , a priest , told deutsche welle .
it would have been the first ever gay pride parade in vilnius .
previous attempts to organize gay pride marches were banned by local authorities .
according to a recent eurobarometer survey , lithuanians are the least aware in the european union of the possibility that they may have homosexuals in their own families .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : greek financial tragedy eurozone wants tough mechanism to defend stability of the euro french parliament approves greek aid ahead of german vote german parliament gives thumbs up to greece aid package chancellor merkel fails to win opposition support for greece bailout greece -pipe- 05.05.2010 chancellor merkel defends position as parliament debates greece bailout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said a the bailout was necessary for europe the german government is likely to approve berlin 's share of a 120 billion euro bailout package for greece .
but the path leading to the bailout has been rocky , and some blame chancellor merkel . at the start of a day of debate in the german parliament about the european union financial bailout for greece , chancellor angela merkel made one thing clear in an address to the bundestag . " this is about nothing less than the future of europe and the future of germany in europe , " merkel said about the decision for germany to back a rescue package for greece . merkel has found herself needing to defend her about-face on sending help to athens .
initially , merkel was against a greek bailout .
however as pressure built from the rest of the european union , merkel changed her tune .
now , legislation to approve 22.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- is up for a vote in the bundestag .
germany 's contribution is part of a three-year , 120-billion-euro bailout from the eu and the international monetary fund . all of the conditions germany had set for approving a bailout package had been fulfilled , merkel told parliamentarians . first and foremost was a consolidation plan for greece to get its out-of-control budget back on track , and close behind was the involvement of the imf , which is to contribute 30 billion euros to the total package . greece 's daunting task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she believed papandreou would keep his country on track with its saving merkel justified her decision to hold back her approval of the bailout package until germany could be absolutely sure greece had met all of the pre-conditions . " without sufficient consideration to preconditions , " merkel said , " the expectations of other deeply indebted members of the eurozone that they would quickly receive help without their own consolidation efforts would have risen . " as public and private sector strikes continued in greece against the government 's proposed efforts to cut back spending , merkel expressed her confidence in athens to keep to its word . i trust that my greek counterpart , prime minster -lrb- george -rrb- papandreou , will carry out this program , no matter how daunting it may be . " devil in the details although all the parties in the german government generally agree that a bailout for greece is necessary , not everyone is happy with how merkel and her coalition government handled the situation . the parliamentary party leader of the opposition social democrats , frank-walter steinmeier , agreed that greece was in need of german and european help .
but he said his party would not agree to a blank check for greece , citing a rift between the coalition government and the opposition on the details . " it would be nice if there were n't galaxies and light years between the parties in such an important decision , " steinmeier added . by continuing to put off the decision on whether or not germany was on board with a greek bailout , merkel 's critics say the situation was exacerbated , putting unnecessary strain on the eurozone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is set to vote on a greek bailout by friday merkel 's cold feet ? gregor gysi , head of the left party in parliament , accused merkel of repeating her performance in dealing with the global financial crisis , when chancellor merkel 's government agreed to billions in bailouts for german-based banks . " we told you then that debt crises could hit entire nations , " gysi said .
" now what is happening in greece is threatening other countries , such as ireland , italy , spain and portugal .
every time , you put your hands on your lap and do nothing initially , only to turn around and make billions available later , just like back then with the banks . " the german parliament is expected to pass the bailout bill by friday , ahead of a crucial may 9 debt deadline for greece . mz / dpa / afpe editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision has shocked the organizers of the parade and the country 's president . a lithuanian court on wednesday banned a planned gay rights march in a decision which has shocked organizers and the country 's president .
" there 's a constitutional right to peaceful assembly .
if groups of citizens or organisations are n't illegal , they have a right to express their views , " a spokesperson for president dalia grybauskaite told reporters .
the lithuanian attorney general 's office insists security is the only reason it has asked the court to annul a license for what would have been lithuania 's first gay pride march in the capital vilnius .
" whose fault would it be if anyone gets hurt ?
it might look like we are homophobic , but i am not sure if we 'd look better with pictures of violence on tv , " attorney general raimundas petrauskas said .
petrauskas believes radical and violent groups are organizing protests and provocations against the participants of the gay march .
police reaction the police , however , say that they have enough manpower to ensure security .
around 800 police officers were supposed to protect the marchers .
president dalia grybauskaite said she was astounded by what she calls a failure of communication between two of the country 's institutions .
" the bodies responsible for public order , above all the police , have an obligation to ensure a situation remains calm and there are no clashes , " her spokesperson said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania 's president says she is shocked by the court 's decision .
the organizers of the march are shocked by the decision and have applied for an appeal .
but there is next to no chance the appeal can be heard before saturday .
one of the organizers , arturas rudomanskis from the tolerant youth association , says sexual minorities have a constitutional right to peaceful assembly and it is the police who are to blame if they can not guarantee that right . "
i think the president should look carefully to see if she has chosen the right person for the prosecutors office , " rudomanskis told deutsche welle .
" lithuania was able to protect the us president during his visit here and also the british queen .
so why ca n't the country assure the safety of a peaceful meeting by its own citizens ? " he added .
amnesty international has also condemned the court 's decision , saying that it violates human rights .
" the authorities in lithuania must ensure that the march goes ahead unobstructed and safely as they are obliged under international law to guarantee the rights to freedom to expression and assembly , " john dalhuisen , amnesty international 's expert on discrimination in europe said in a statement .
march part of a five-day festival the gay pride parade was only one event in a five-day festival on the subject of equal rights for sexual minorities .
however , the march has sparked a fierce public debate in staunchly catholic lithunia .
several anti-gay protests have been organized and a group of members of parliament has filed a petition against the march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral of vilnius represents the country 's catholic heritage members of the clergy are among the most outspoken critics , insisting that the most important thing is to protect lithuanian families .
" imagine all those wrongdoers in vilnius .
they want to show that their law is above everything .
above the ten commandments , above god , above the history of our nation , " alfonsas svarinskas , a priest , told deutsche welle .
it would have been the first ever gay pride parade in vilnius .
previous attempts to organize gay pride marches were banned by local authorities .
according to a recent eurobarometer survey , lithuanians are the least aware in the european union of the possibility that they may have homosexuals in their own families .

the decision has shocked the organizers of the parade and the country 's president . a lithuanian court on wednesday banned a planned gay rights march in a decision which has shocked organizers and the country 's president .
" there 's a constitutional right to peaceful assembly .
if groups of citizens or organisations are n't illegal , they have a right to express their views , " a spokesperson for president dalia grybauskaite told reporters .
the lithuanian attorney general 's office insists security is the only reason it has asked the court to annul a license for what would have been lithuania 's first gay pride march in the capital vilnius .
" whose fault would it be if anyone gets hurt ?
it might look like we are homophobic , but i am not sure if we 'd look better with pictures of violence on tv , " attorney general raimundas petrauskas said .
petrauskas believes radical and violent groups are organizing protests and provocations against the participants of the gay march .
police reaction the police , however , say that they have enough manpower to ensure security .
around 800 police officers were supposed to protect the marchers .
president dalia grybauskaite said she was astounded by what she calls a failure of communication between two of the country 's institutions .
" the bodies responsible for public order , above all the police , have an obligation to ensure a situation remains calm and there are no clashes , " her spokesperson said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania 's president says she is shocked by the court 's decision .
the organizers of the march are shocked by the decision and have applied for an appeal .
but there is next to no chance the appeal can be heard before saturday .
one of the organizers , arturas rudomanskis from the tolerant youth association , says sexual minorities have a constitutional right to peaceful assembly and it is the police who are to blame if they can not guarantee that right . "
i think the president should look carefully to see if she has chosen the right person for the prosecutors office , " rudomanskis told deutsche welle .
" lithuania was able to protect the us president during his visit here and also the british queen .
so why ca n't the country assure the safety of a peaceful meeting by its own citizens ? " he added .
amnesty international has also condemned the court 's decision , saying that it violates human rights .
" the authorities in lithuania must ensure that the march goes ahead unobstructed and safely as they are obliged under international law to guarantee the rights to freedom to expression and assembly , " john dalhuisen , amnesty international 's expert on discrimination in europe said in a statement .
march part of a five-day festival the gay pride parade was only one event in a five-day festival on the subject of equal rights for sexual minorities .
however , the march has sparked a fierce public debate in staunchly catholic lithunia .
several anti-gay protests have been organized and a group of members of parliament has filed a petition against the march .

however , the disruption looks set to be far less than last month 's . a fresh volcanic ash cloud forced british and irish air traffic authorities to close parts of their airspace on wednesday , as iceland 's eyjafjallajoekull volcano continued to disrupt european flight paths .
a drifting cloud of ash from the volcano led to flights being halted across most of the continent for almost a week in april .
britain 's civil aviation authority -lrb- caa -rrb- said late on tuesday that air traffic to and from three airports in scotland , including glasgow , would not be allowed as of 6 a.m. gmt wednesday .
the airport in edinburgh , scotland ’ s capital , remained open until midday .
belfast 's airport , in northern ireland , was also closed and flights to and from dublin in the republic of ireland were shut down from 10 a.m.
the irish aviation authority said all airports in ireland could be affected by early afternoon .
" forecasts show that levels of ash in the atmosphere over scotland and northern ireland will exceed the concentrations that engine manufacturers have agreed are safe for operations , " the caa said in a statement .
ash from iceland had caused a similar closure in the same areas from monday until the middle of tuesday this week .
both irish and british authorities fear the volcanic ash , which can damage aircraft engines and instruments when present in large quantities , will spread south during the day , perhaps causing further airport closures in the north of england .
smaller disruptions however , the caa said there was no imminent threat to britain ’ s busiest southern airports , like london 's heathrow and gatwick .
the primary ash cloud from eyjafjallajoekull 's eruption in april brought the majority of european air travel to a standstill for six days , leaving millions of travellers stranded and costing airlines and industry hundreds of millions of euros .
at a meeting on tuesday , european union transport ministers agreed the eu should immediately create a unified air traffic group to ensure member states coordinate their reactions to any similar problems in the future , in a bid to minimize disruptions and costs. msh / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

faisal shahzad is an american citizen of pakistani origin . faisal shahzad has apparently confessed to planting the bomb in times square , but in his home country , pakistan , the reactions vary : some are skeptical and some are in denial . one accountant from karachi is in disbelief : " what evidence do the americans have ?
they could claim anything to blame us pakistanis for acts of terror . "
a business man is of the opinion : " as long as the usa keeps getting involved in our affairs , the taliban will stay involved in theirs . "
among the pakistani people there is a sense of deep animosity towards america and a feeling of being victimized .

before that , the group had carried out other attacks in india , among them on the indian parliament in delhi .
experts also believe that let was planning to carry out an attack on the american embassy in bangladesh in november .

members of parliament hope that he will reaffirm us-eu ties - and patch up a few things . members of the european parliament should highlight february 11 , 2010 in their calendars .
it was on that thursday a couple of months ago that they and their institution for the first time appeared in earnest on the radar of most us politicians .
prior to that day and their overwhelming , cross-party rejection of the transfer of financial data to the us under the so-called swift agreement , the european parliament and its work went largely unnoticed in washington .
the swift veto that has left eu and us officials scrambling since then for a replacement agreement served as a wake-up call that a new player with real power had emerged on europe 's political landscape .
that 's certainly true , says elmar brok , chairman of the european parliament delegation with the us and a leading member of the european people 's party .
he adds that washington has realized that the legislature does n't only have overall codecison powers , but also that parliament has to ratify all third country agreements and treaties of the eu .
the message was that in effect , says brok , " nothing can be decided at the end of the day against the will of the european parliament . "
unusual business joe biden 's speech before the european parliament therefore should also be viewed against the backdrop of the body 's newly asserted role .
" it is indeed not everyday business that the vice president of the united states would visit the european parliament and in a way i think the obama administration is paying tribute to the newly enhanced role of the parliament , " says reinhard buetikofer , a member of the delegation with the us and vice-chair of the greens in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament 's veto of the swift agreement put it on the map in washington what 's more , argue brok and buetikofer , biden 's brussel 's speech can serve as an important signal of cooperation between the us and the eu after president barack obama 's decision to cancel his participation in the upcoming bilateral summit in madrid caused some consternation in europe .
buetikofer also hopes that biden , a former senator with vast experience in foreign relations , will set the record straight on europe 's contribution to international security .
refering to a speech us secretary of state hillary clinton gave earlier this year in paris , buetikofer says he was surprised that clinton did n't mention europe 's common foreign and security policy at all .
" so people have wondered , including myself , whether the european contribution to europe 's security , the european engagement in missions like atalanta -lrb- the eu 's anti-piracy operation off the coast of somalia - ed . -rrb- , are at all on the screen in washington . "
so while biden could clearly patch up a few things in european-american affairs , relations between the european parliament and its us counterpart are on a good track since the swift vote . reinvigorate transatlantic dialogue " when we spoke to members of congress in march they explained that the speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , had decided to upgrade the status of the transatlantic legislators dialogue -lrb- tld -rrb- within congress , " says buetikofer .
the tld is a long-standing debate forum for european and us parlamentarians that has effectively been in a deep slumber since its inception - mostly due to a lack of interest from the american side .
now , says brok , is the time to wake it up .
" we have to strengthen the transatlantic legislators dialogue .
we have to work on that in the future and have closer relationships with committees and rapporteurs concerned in order to avoid that we legislate in the us congress or in the european parliament in a way that goes in different directions which would be unhelpful for both sides . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : house speaker nancy pelosi supports stronger ties to european legislators while the house of representatives under the leadership of nancy pelosi has already understood the importance of closer cooperation with european parliamentarians , the us senate is still more reluctant , say brok and buetikofer .
both eu parliamentarians emphasize that striving for closer ties with the us does n't negate reaching out to other countries as well . " however we do see a clear agenda with regard to the transatlantic relationship and it needs some attention , " says buetikofer .
" we should n't let that slip away , just because we believe that asia is coming up strong and that we should also pay attention to that .
i think the parliament has the power and the vision to do both . "

members of parliament hope that he will reaffirm us-eu ties - and patch up a few things . members of the european parliament should highlight february 11 , 2010 in their calendars .
it was on that thursday a couple of months ago that they and their institution for the first time appeared in earnest on the radar of most us politicians .
prior to that day and their overwhelming , cross-party rejection of the transfer of financial data to the us under the so-called swift agreement , the european parliament and its work went largely unnoticed in washington .
the swift veto that has left eu and us officials scrambling since then for a replacement agreement served as a wake-up call that a new player with real power had emerged on europe 's political landscape .
that 's certainly true , says elmar brok , chairman of the european parliament delegation with the us and a leading member of the european people 's party .
he adds that washington has realized that the legislature does n't only have overall codecison powers , but also that parliament has to ratify all third country agreements and treaties of the eu .
the message was that in effect , says brok , " nothing can be decided at the end of the day against the will of the european parliament . "
unusual business joe biden 's speech before the european parliament therefore should also be viewed against the backdrop of the body 's newly asserted role .
" it is indeed not everyday business that the vice president of the united states would visit the european parliament and in a way i think the obama administration is paying tribute to the newly enhanced role of the parliament , " says reinhard buetikofer , a member of the delegation with the us and vice-chair of the greens in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament 's veto of the swift agreement put it on the map in washington what 's more , argue brok and buetikofer , biden 's brussel 's speech can serve as an important signal of cooperation between the us and the eu after president barack obama 's decision to cancel his participation in the upcoming bilateral summit in madrid caused some consternation in europe .
buetikofer also hopes that biden , a former senator with vast experience in foreign relations , will set the record straight on europe 's contribution to international security .
refering to a speech us secretary of state hillary clinton gave earlier this year in paris , buetikofer says he was surprised that clinton did n't mention europe 's common foreign and security policy at all .
" so people have wondered , including myself , whether the european contribution to europe 's security , the european engagement in missions like atalanta -lrb- the eu 's anti-piracy operation off the coast of somalia - ed . -rrb- , are at all on the screen in washington . "
so while biden could clearly patch up a few things in european-american affairs , relations between the european parliament and its us counterpart are on a good track since the swift vote . reinvigorate transatlantic dialogue " when we spoke to members of congress in march they explained that the speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , had decided to upgrade the status of the transatlantic legislators dialogue -lrb- tld -rrb- within congress , " says buetikofer .
the tld is a long-standing debate forum for european and us parlamentarians that has effectively been in a deep slumber since its inception - mostly due to a lack of interest from the american side .
now , says brok , is the time to wake it up .
" we have to strengthen the transatlantic legislators dialogue .
we have to work on that in the future and have closer relationships with committees and rapporteurs concerned in order to avoid that we legislate in the us congress or in the european parliament in a way that goes in different directions which would be unhelpful for both sides . "

however , much appears to depend on preventing the type of economic collapse seen in greece from spreading . economic growth in the eu is set to pick up faster than previously expected according to the european commission – provided that the type of economic collapse seen in greece can be kept contained .
the commission on wednesday raised growth predictions for the eurozone to 0.9 percent this year , compared to a 0.7 percent forecast made in february .
however , brussels warned of the potential of a domino effect that could bring down other european economies with high burdens of debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green shoots of recovery are threatened by wider financial collapse the danger posed by wider financial meltdown was likened that of a forest fire by eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn .
" in order to safeguard the economic recovery , which is still rather modest and somewhat fragile , it 's absolutely essential to contain the bushfire in greece so that it will not become a forest fire , " said rehn .
threat to stability the fear of economic contagion constituted a real " threat to financial stability for the european union and its economy as a whole , " rehn stressed .
greece is close to the brink of debt default , requiring a bailout by other members of the european union and the international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece , on the brink of default , has asked for help the forecasts reveal weaknesses in states such as spain , portugal and ireland , which have high debt along with low growth or recession .
spain 's deficit is tipped to hit almost 10 per cent of gross domestic product in 2010 , with the economy shrinking by 0.4 percent .
britain has the highest deficit of the eu countries considered at risk , set to hit 12 percent of gdp in 2010 .
however , the british economy is expected to grow by 1.2 percent during the same period . according to the twice-yearly forecast , growth for the eu as a whole is set to reach 1 per cent this year and 1.7 per cent next year .
growth is expected to be driven by demand from emerging economies such as china and brazil , rather than demand within europe. rc / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the path leading to the bailout has been rocky , and some blame chancellor merkel . at the start of a day of debate in the german parliament about the european union financial bailout for greece , chancellor angela merkel made one thing clear in an address to the bundestag . " this is about nothing less than the future of europe and the future of germany in europe , " merkel said about the decision for germany to back a rescue package for greece . merkel has found herself needing to defend her about-face on sending help to athens .
initially , merkel was against a greek bailout .
however as pressure built from the rest of the european union , merkel changed her tune .
now , legislation to approve 22.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 30 billion -rrb- is up for a vote in the bundestag .
germany 's contribution is part of a three-year , 120-billion-euro bailout from the eu and the international monetary fund . all of the conditions germany had set for approving a bailout package had been fulfilled , merkel told parliamentarians . first and foremost was a consolidation plan for greece to get its out-of-control budget back on track , and close behind was the involvement of the imf , which is to contribute 30 billion euros to the total package . greece 's daunting task bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said she believed papandreou would keep his country on track with its saving merkel justified her decision to hold back her approval of the bailout package until germany could be absolutely sure greece had met all of the pre-conditions . " without sufficient consideration to preconditions , " merkel said , " the expectations of other deeply indebted members of the eurozone that they would quickly receive help without their own consolidation efforts would have risen . " as public and private sector strikes continued in greece against the government 's proposed efforts to cut back spending , merkel expressed her confidence in athens to keep to its word . i trust that my greek counterpart , prime minster -lrb- george -rrb- papandreou , will carry out this program , no matter how daunting it may be . " devil in the details although all the parties in the german government generally agree that a bailout for greece is necessary , not everyone is happy with how merkel and her coalition government handled the situation . the parliamentary party leader of the opposition social democrats , frank-walter steinmeier , agreed that greece was in need of german and european help .
but he said his party would not agree to a blank check for greece , citing a rift between the coalition government and the opposition on the details . " it would be nice if there were n't galaxies and light years between the parties in such an important decision , " steinmeier added . by continuing to put off the decision on whether or not germany was on board with a greek bailout , merkel 's critics say the situation was exacerbated , putting unnecessary strain on the eurozone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is set to vote on a greek bailout by friday merkel 's cold feet ? gregor gysi , head of the left party in parliament , accused merkel of repeating her performance in dealing with the global financial crisis , when chancellor merkel 's government agreed to billions in bailouts for german-based banks . " we told you then that debt crises could hit entire nations , " gysi said .
" now what is happening in greece is threatening other countries , such as ireland , italy , spain and portugal .
every time , you put your hands on your lap and do nothing initially , only to turn around and make billions available later , just like back then with the banks . " the german parliament is expected to pass the bailout bill by friday , ahead of a crucial may 9 debt deadline for greece . mz / dpa / afpe editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the lithuanian attorney general 's office insists security is the only reason it has asked the court to annul a license for what would have been lithuania 's first gay pride march in the capital vilnius .
" whose fault would it be if anyone gets hurt ?
it might look like we are homophobic , but i am not sure if we 'd look better with pictures of violence on tv , " attorney general raimundas petrauskas said .
petrauskas believes radical and violent groups are organizing protests and provocations against the participants of the gay march .
police reaction the police , however , say that they have enough manpower to ensure security .
around 800 police officers were supposed to protect the marchers .
president dalia grybauskaite said she was astounded by what she calls a failure of communication between two of the country 's institutions .
" the bodies responsible for public order , above all the police , have an obligation to ensure a situation remains calm and there are no clashes , " her spokesperson said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania 's president says she is shocked by the court 's decision .
the organizers of the march are shocked by the decision and have applied for an appeal .
but there is next to no chance the appeal can be heard before saturday .
one of the organizers , arturas rudomanskis from the tolerant youth association , says sexual minorities have a constitutional right to peaceful assembly and it is the police who are to blame if they can not guarantee that right . "
i think the president should look carefully to see if she has chosen the right person for the prosecutors office , " rudomanskis told deutsche welle .
" lithuania was able to protect the us president during his visit here and also the british queen .
so why ca n't the country assure the safety of a peaceful meeting by its own citizens ? " he added .
amnesty international has also condemned the court 's decision , saying that it violates human rights .
" the authorities in lithuania must ensure that the march goes ahead unobstructed and safely as they are obliged under international law to guarantee the rights to freedom to expression and assembly , " john dalhuisen , amnesty international 's expert on discrimination in europe said in a statement .
march part of a five-day festival the gay pride parade was only one event in a five-day festival on the subject of equal rights for sexual minorities .
however , the march has sparked a fierce public debate in staunchly catholic lithunia .
several anti-gay protests have been organized and a group of members of parliament has filed a petition against the march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral of vilnius represents the country 's catholic heritage members of the clergy are among the most outspoken critics , insisting that the most important thing is to protect lithuanian families .
" imagine all those wrongdoers in vilnius .
they want to show that their law is above everything .
above the ten commandments , above god , above the history of our nation , " alfonsas svarinskas , a priest , told deutsche welle .
it would have been the first ever gay pride parade in vilnius .
previous attempts to organize gay pride marches were banned by local authorities .
according to a recent eurobarometer survey , lithuanians are the least aware in the european union of the possibility that they may have homosexuals in their own families .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 05.05.2010 biden speech could set the record straight on eu-us relations , say legislators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the expectations are high for joe biden 's speech in brussels in what the white house has billed a major address , us vice president biden will speak at the european parliament on thursday .
members of parliament hope that he will reaffirm us-eu ties - and patch up a few things . members of the european parliament should highlight february 11 , 2010 in their calendars .
it was on that thursday a couple of months ago that they and their institution for the first time appeared in earnest on the radar of most us politicians .
prior to that day and their overwhelming , cross-party rejection of the transfer of financial data to the us under the so-called swift agreement , the european parliament and its work went largely unnoticed in washington .
the swift veto that has left eu and us officials scrambling since then for a replacement agreement served as a wake-up call that a new player with real power had emerged on europe 's political landscape .
that 's certainly true , says elmar brok , chairman of the european parliament delegation with the us and a leading member of the european people 's party .
he adds that washington has realized that the legislature does n't only have overall codecison powers , but also that parliament has to ratify all third country agreements and treaties of the eu .
the message was that in effect , says brok , " nothing can be decided at the end of the day against the will of the european parliament . "
unusual business joe biden 's speech before the european parliament therefore should also be viewed against the backdrop of the body 's newly asserted role .
" it is indeed not everyday business that the vice president of the united states would visit the european parliament and in a way i think the obama administration is paying tribute to the newly enhanced role of the parliament , " says reinhard buetikofer , a member of the delegation with the us and vice-chair of the greens in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament 's veto of the swift agreement put it on the map in washington what 's more , argue brok and buetikofer , biden 's brussel 's speech can serve as an important signal of cooperation between the us and the eu after president barack obama 's decision to cancel his participation in the upcoming bilateral summit in madrid caused some consternation in europe .
buetikofer also hopes that biden , a former senator with vast experience in foreign relations , will set the record straight on europe 's contribution to international security .
refering to a speech us secretary of state hillary clinton gave earlier this year in paris , buetikofer says he was surprised that clinton did n't mention europe 's common foreign and security policy at all .
" so people have wondered , including myself , whether the european contribution to europe 's security , the european engagement in missions like atalanta -lrb- the eu 's anti-piracy operation off the coast of somalia - ed . -rrb- , are at all on the screen in washington . "
so while biden could clearly patch up a few things in european-american affairs , relations between the european parliament and its us counterpart are on a good track since the swift vote . reinvigorate transatlantic dialogue " when we spoke to members of congress in march they explained that the speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , had decided to upgrade the status of the transatlantic legislators dialogue -lrb- tld -rrb- within congress , " says buetikofer .
the tld is a long-standing debate forum for european and us parlamentarians that has effectively been in a deep slumber since its inception - mostly due to a lack of interest from the american side .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 05.05.2010 biden speech could set the record straight on eu-us relations , say legislators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the expectations are high for joe biden 's speech in brussels in what the white house has billed a major address , us vice president biden will speak at the european parliament on thursday .
members of parliament hope that he will reaffirm us-eu ties - and patch up a few things . members of the european parliament should highlight february 11 , 2010 in their calendars .
it was on that thursday a couple of months ago that they and their institution for the first time appeared in earnest on the radar of most us politicians .
prior to that day and their overwhelming , cross-party rejection of the transfer of financial data to the us under the so-called swift agreement , the european parliament and its work went largely unnoticed in washington .
the swift veto that has left eu and us officials scrambling since then for a replacement agreement served as a wake-up call that a new player with real power had emerged on europe 's political landscape .
that 's certainly true , says elmar brok , chairman of the european parliament delegation with the us and a leading member of the european people 's party .
he adds that washington has realized that the legislature does n't only have overall codecison powers , but also that parliament has to ratify all third country agreements and treaties of the eu .
the message was that in effect , says brok , " nothing can be decided at the end of the day against the will of the european parliament . "
unusual business joe biden 's speech before the european parliament therefore should also be viewed against the backdrop of the body 's newly asserted role .
" it is indeed not everyday business that the vice president of the united states would visit the european parliament and in a way i think the obama administration is paying tribute to the newly enhanced role of the parliament , " says reinhard buetikofer , a member of the delegation with the us and vice-chair of the greens in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament 's veto of the swift agreement put it on the map in washington what 's more , argue brok and buetikofer , biden 's brussel 's speech can serve as an important signal of cooperation between the us and the eu after president barack obama 's decision to cancel his participation in the upcoming bilateral summit in madrid caused some consternation in europe .
buetikofer also hopes that biden , a former senator with vast experience in foreign relations , will set the record straight on europe 's contribution to international security .
refering to a speech us secretary of state hillary clinton gave earlier this year in paris , buetikofer says he was surprised that clinton did n't mention europe 's common foreign and security policy at all .
" so people have wondered , including myself , whether the european contribution to europe 's security , the european engagement in missions like atalanta -lrb- the eu 's anti-piracy operation off the coast of somalia - ed . -rrb- , are at all on the screen in washington . "
so while biden could clearly patch up a few things in european-american affairs , relations between the european parliament and its us counterpart are on a good track since the swift vote . reinvigorate transatlantic dialogue " when we spoke to members of congress in march they explained that the speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , had decided to upgrade the status of the transatlantic legislators dialogue -lrb- tld -rrb- within congress , " says buetikofer .
the tld is a long-standing debate forum for european and us parlamentarians that has effectively been in a deep slumber since its inception - mostly due to a lack of interest from the american side .
now , says brok , is the time to wake it up .
" we have to strengthen the transatlantic legislators dialogue .
we have to work on that in the future and have closer relationships with committees and rapporteurs concerned in order to avoid that we legislate in the us congress or in the european parliament in a way that goes in different directions which would be unhelpful for both sides . "

faisal shahzad is an american citizen of pakistani origin . faisal shahzad has apparently confessed to planting the bomb in times square , but in his home country , pakistan , the reactions vary : some are skeptical and some are in denial . one accountant from karachi is in disbelief : " what evidence do the americans have ?
they could claim anything to blame us pakistanis for acts of terror . "
a business man is of the opinion : " as long as the usa keeps getting involved in our affairs , the taliban will stay involved in theirs . "
among the pakistani people there is a sense of deep animosity towards america and a feeling of being victimized .
nonetheless the pakistani police has arrested numerous people in connection with the attempted attack in new york .
now authorities are working on finding out if faisal shahzad was acting alone or if he was working for a pakistani terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shahzad was taken into custody on monday while trying to board a flight to dubai bomb making classes in pakistan shahzad has reportedly stated he was trained in bomb-making in his home country .
according to statements made by his mother , last year he spent time in northwest pakistan , a stronghold of islamist insurgents .
the group that confessed to the attack is known as the " tehrik-e-taliban pakistan " , but it is still not clear whether or not they are really responsible .
until now they have mainly carried out attacks in pakistan .
but in another video , the leader of the terrorist group , hakimullah mehsud , recently threatened to carry out attacks in american cities .
mehsud was also filmed with a jordanian al qaeda terrorist who was responsible for the deaths of seven cia agents last year in khost , afghanistan .
terrorism beyond the borders so it would seem that tehrik-e-taliban pakistan is looking to expand terrorist activities beyond pakistani borders .
the prohibited group lashkar-e-taiba -lrb- let for short -rrb- is another terrorist group that went beyond the borders .
now it is said they are operating through dummy organizations .
in 2008 they organized the terror attacks in mumbai , in which 175 people were killed .
however , a speaker of the group denies any involvement , stating : neither lashkar-e-taiba nor its founder , hafiz saeed , have anything to do with the mumbai attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombproof courtroom in a mumbai jail where ajmal kasab is being tried but evidence from the trial of the only surviving attacker , ajmal kasab , has proven otherwise .
kasab described in great detail how lashkar-e-taiba recruited and trained him and then sent him to mumbai .
before that , the group had carried out other attacks in india , among them on the indian parliament in delhi .
experts also believe that let was planning to carry out an attack on the american embassy in bangladesh in november .
furthermore , david headley , who is currently imprisoned in the united states and , like shahzad , is of pakistani descent , had also been planning attacks on offices and employees of the danish newspaper " jyllands posten " for the let .
the newspaper had become controversial for the printing of cartoons of the prophet muhammad .
ajmal kasab , the mumbai terrorist , was found guilty of all 86 charges in a court in mumbai on monday .
the sentence is due on thursday ; prosecution has called for capital punishment of the 22 -year-old .

however , much appears to depend on preventing the type of economic collapse seen in greece from spreading . economic growth in the eu is set to pick up faster than previously expected according to the european commission – provided that the type of economic collapse seen in greece can be kept contained .
the commission on wednesday raised growth predictions for the eurozone to 0.9 percent this year , compared to a 0.7 percent forecast made in february .
however , brussels warned of the potential of a domino effect that could bring down other european economies with high burdens of debt .

" in order to safeguard the economic recovery , which is still rather modest and somewhat fragile , it 's absolutely essential to contain the bushfire in greece so that it will not become a forest fire , " said rehn .
threat to stability the fear of economic contagion constituted a real " threat to financial stability for the european union and its economy as a whole , " rehn stressed .
greece is close to the brink of debt default , requiring a bailout by other members of the european union and the international monetary fund .

britain has the highest deficit of the eu countries considered at risk , set to hit 12 percent of gdp in 2010 .
however , the british economy is expected to grow by 1.2 percent during the same period . according to the twice-yearly forecast , growth for the eu as a whole is set to reach 1 per cent this year and 1.7 per cent next year .

on may 5 , the first-ever echo for jazz is awarded to the vijay iyer trio from new york . it 's the first time the german record industry will present the echo distinctions - until now monopolized by the pop and classical sectors - for jazz , a genre which has been growing in popularity over the past few years . the vijay iyer trio , with stephan crump on bass , marcus gilmore on drums and bandleader vijay iyer on piano , rocked the jazz scene last fall with their new album " historicity . "
it was hailed by critics on both sides of the atlantic as the best jazz cd of 2009 . still , the band was surprised to be selected for the jazz echo award just months later .
they were n't only selected by an expert jury , but also by the music-loving public as reflected in record and down-load sales . " it 's nice to know that there is both a critical embrace and an audience embrace sort of working together , " said iyer . from math to music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iyer links the rational with the emotional in his music band founder vijay iyer is multi-talented .
born the son of indian immigrants to the us , he grew up playing classical violin .
he studied mathematics and physics at yale university and graduated from the university of california at berkeley with a doctorate in arts and technology . during his student days he started playing piano , jammed in jazz clubs , and began exploring composition .
for him , music became the powerhouse of creativity and the means of self-expression that he had been searching for .
but the mathematician in the musician remained . " anything that 's put together with care and precision involves measurement and that 's also true in music , " said iyer .
" you have measurements of time and measurements of frequency or pitch , to perceive music is to perceive order in sound , so when you 're talking about mathematics in music , you 're talking about ordering events . " the trio 's album combines mathematical with spiritual and emotional elements - which iyer said do n't contradict each other but have always coexisted in music . the bedrock of jazz this synthesis of mathematical perfection and deep spirituality has underpinned vijay iyer 's works since the late 1990s .
he has composed for orchestras and string quartets and written ballet scores and movie soundtracks , but his heart belongs to jazz in general and his echo-award-winning trio in particular . for iyer , the genre of the piano trio has been an elemental force in the development of jazz music . " it 's something so deeply explored by so many masters , especially the pianist-composers like duke ellington or herbie nichols - people who had a vision of how music can sound , " said iyer .
" i 'm not caught up in displaying my own virtuosity but i 'm interested in projecting a unity of intent and that 's something the trio can offer . " that " unity of intent " may be difficult to define but is highly apparent when listening to the trio 's music .
vijay iyer is the composer and frontman , but when the band performs , he does not regard himself as a conductor in the classical sense .
improvisation is the life-blood of jazz , he said , but this has to be given a structure created by the composer . " most of the time , when i 'm composing , i 'm setting up a situation for things to happen , so it 's more like architecture , in the sense that i want people to move around in it , " said iyer , " i want people to live and stretch out and be free inside of the space that i 've created . " the audience as a creative force when the vijay iyer trio takes the stage wednesday evening in bochum to pick up the first-ever echo for the best international jazz ensemble , the band says it will be sharing the award with a huge though nameless creative force that has always been behind it : its audiences on both sides of the atlantic . vijay iyer highlighted that the trio is not making music for itself in an aesthetic vacuum , but aims above all to connect with the listeners . " this is something i think is inherent to jazz in particular because there 's so much improvisation involved , there 's really a sense that the music is being created just for that moment and not just for its own sake but for the force of communication and connection , " said the musician .

on may 5 , the first-ever echo for jazz is awarded to the vijay iyer trio from new york . it 's the first time the german record industry will present the echo distinctions - until now monopolized by the pop and classical sectors - for jazz , a genre which has been growing in popularity over the past few years . the vijay iyer trio , with stephan crump on bass , marcus gilmore on drums and bandleader vijay iyer on piano , rocked the jazz scene last fall with their new album " historicity . "
it was hailed by critics on both sides of the atlantic as the best jazz cd of 2009 . still , the band was surprised to be selected for the jazz echo award just months later .
they were n't only selected by an expert jury , but also by the music-loving public as reflected in record and down-load sales . " it 's nice to know that there is both a critical embrace and an audience embrace sort of working together , " said iyer . from math to music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iyer links the rational with the emotional in his music band founder vijay iyer is multi-talented .
born the son of indian immigrants to the us , he grew up playing classical violin .
he studied mathematics and physics at yale university and graduated from the university of california at berkeley with a doctorate in arts and technology . during his student days he started playing piano , jammed in jazz clubs , and began exploring composition .
for him , music became the powerhouse of creativity and the means of self-expression that he had been searching for .
but the mathematician in the musician remained . " anything that 's put together with care and precision involves measurement and that 's also true in music , " said iyer .
" you have measurements of time and measurements of frequency or pitch , to perceive music is to perceive order in sound , so when you 're talking about mathematics in music , you 're talking about ordering events . " the trio 's album combines mathematical with spiritual and emotional elements - which iyer said do n't contradict each other but have always coexisted in music . the bedrock of jazz this synthesis of mathematical perfection and deep spirituality has underpinned vijay iyer 's works since the late 1990s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 05.05.2010 biden speech could set the record straight on eu-us relations , say legislators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the expectations are high for joe biden 's speech in brussels in what the white house has billed a major address , us vice president biden will speak at the european parliament on thursday .
members of parliament hope that he will reaffirm us-eu ties - and patch up a few things . members of the european parliament should highlight february 11 , 2010 in their calendars .
it was on that thursday a couple of months ago that they and their institution for the first time appeared in earnest on the radar of most us politicians .
prior to that day and their overwhelming , cross-party rejection of the transfer of financial data to the us under the so-called swift agreement , the european parliament and its work went largely unnoticed in washington .
the swift veto that has left eu and us officials scrambling since then for a replacement agreement served as a wake-up call that a new player with real power had emerged on europe 's political landscape .
that 's certainly true , says elmar brok , chairman of the european parliament delegation with the us and a leading member of the european people 's party .
he adds that washington has realized that the legislature does n't only have overall codecison powers , but also that parliament has to ratify all third country agreements and treaties of the eu .
the message was that in effect , says brok , " nothing can be decided at the end of the day against the will of the european parliament . "
unusual business joe biden 's speech before the european parliament therefore should also be viewed against the backdrop of the body 's newly asserted role .
" it is indeed not everyday business that the vice president of the united states would visit the european parliament and in a way i think the obama administration is paying tribute to the newly enhanced role of the parliament , " says reinhard buetikofer , a member of the delegation with the us and vice-chair of the greens in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament 's veto of the swift agreement put it on the map in washington what 's more , argue brok and buetikofer , biden 's brussel 's speech can serve as an important signal of cooperation between the us and the eu after president barack obama 's decision to cancel his participation in the upcoming bilateral summit in madrid caused some consternation in europe .
buetikofer also hopes that biden , a former senator with vast experience in foreign relations , will set the record straight on europe 's contribution to international security .
refering to a speech us secretary of state hillary clinton gave earlier this year in paris , buetikofer says he was surprised that clinton did n't mention europe 's common foreign and security policy at all .
" so people have wondered , including myself , whether the european contribution to europe 's security , the european engagement in missions like atalanta -lrb- the eu 's anti-piracy operation off the coast of somalia - ed . -rrb- , are at all on the screen in washington . "
so while biden could clearly patch up a few things in european-american affairs , relations between the european parliament and its us counterpart are on a good track since the swift vote . reinvigorate transatlantic dialogue " when we spoke to members of congress in march they explained that the speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , had decided to upgrade the status of the transatlantic legislators dialogue -lrb- tld -rrb- within congress , " says buetikofer .
the tld is a long-standing debate forum for european and us parlamentarians that has effectively been in a deep slumber since its inception - mostly due to a lack of interest from the american side .
now , says brok , is the time to wake it up .
" we have to strengthen the transatlantic legislators dialogue .
we have to work on that in the future and have closer relationships with committees and rapporteurs concerned in order to avoid that we legislate in the us congress or in the european parliament in a way that goes in different directions which would be unhelpful for both sides . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : house speaker nancy pelosi supports stronger ties to european legislators while the house of representatives under the leadership of nancy pelosi has already understood the importance of closer cooperation with european parliamentarians , the us senate is still more reluctant , say brok and buetikofer .
both eu parliamentarians emphasize that striving for closer ties with the us does n't negate reaching out to other countries as well . " however we do see a clear agenda with regard to the transatlantic relationship and it needs some attention , " says buetikofer .
" we should n't let that slip away , just because we believe that asia is coming up strong and that we should also pay attention to that .
i think the parliament has the power and the vision to do both . "

the decision has shocked the organizers of the parade and the country 's president . a lithuanian court on wednesday banned a planned gay rights march in a decision which has shocked organizers and the country 's president .
" there 's a constitutional right to peaceful assembly .
if groups of citizens or organisations are n't illegal , they have a right to express their views , " a spokesperson for president dalia grybauskaite told reporters .
the lithuanian attorney general 's office insists security is the only reason it has asked the court to annul a license for what would have been lithuania 's first gay pride march in the capital vilnius .
" whose fault would it be if anyone gets hurt ?
it might look like we are homophobic , but i am not sure if we 'd look better with pictures of violence on tv , " attorney general raimundas petrauskas said .
petrauskas believes radical and violent groups are organizing protests and provocations against the participants of the gay march .
police reaction the police , however , say that they have enough manpower to ensure security .
around 800 police officers were supposed to protect the marchers .
president dalia grybauskaite said she was astounded by what she calls a failure of communication between two of the country 's institutions .
" the bodies responsible for public order , above all the police , have an obligation to ensure a situation remains calm and there are no clashes , " her spokesperson said .

the organizers of the march are shocked by the decision and have applied for an appeal .
but there is next to no chance the appeal can be heard before saturday .
one of the organizers , arturas rudomanskis from the tolerant youth association , says sexual minorities have a constitutional right to peaceful assembly and it is the police who are to blame if they can not guarantee that right . "
i think the president should look carefully to see if she has chosen the right person for the prosecutors office , " rudomanskis told deutsche welle .
" lithuania was able to protect the us president during his visit here and also the british queen .
so why ca n't the country assure the safety of a peaceful meeting by its own citizens ? " he added .
amnesty international has also condemned the court 's decision , saying that it violates human rights .
" the authorities in lithuania must ensure that the march goes ahead unobstructed and safely as they are obliged under international law to guarantee the rights to freedom to expression and assembly , " john dalhuisen , amnesty international 's expert on discrimination in europe said in a statement .
march part of a five-day festival the gay pride parade was only one event in a five-day festival on the subject of equal rights for sexual minorities .
however , the march has sparked a fierce public debate in staunchly catholic lithunia .
several anti-gay protests have been organized and a group of members of parliament has filed a petition against the march .

however , much appears to depend on preventing the type of economic collapse seen in greece from spreading . economic growth in the eu is set to pick up faster than previously expected according to the european commission – provided that the type of economic collapse seen in greece can be kept contained .
the commission on wednesday raised growth predictions for the eurozone to 0.9 percent this year , compared to a 0.7 percent forecast made in february .
however , brussels warned of the potential of a domino effect that could bring down other european economies with high burdens of debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green shoots of recovery are threatened by wider financial collapse the danger posed by wider financial meltdown was likened that of a forest fire by eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn .
" in order to safeguard the economic recovery , which is still rather modest and somewhat fragile , it 's absolutely essential to contain the bushfire in greece so that it will not become a forest fire , " said rehn .
threat to stability the fear of economic contagion constituted a real " threat to financial stability for the european union and its economy as a whole , " rehn stressed .
greece is close to the brink of debt default , requiring a bailout by other members of the european union and the international monetary fund .

britain has the highest deficit of the eu countries considered at risk , set to hit 12 percent of gdp in 2010 .
however , the british economy is expected to grow by 1.2 percent during the same period . according to the twice-yearly forecast , growth for the eu as a whole is set to reach 1 per cent this year and 1.7 per cent next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 05.05.2010 pakistan in the spotlight after failed times square bombing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the intersection of 45th street and seventh avenue where the car bomb was found american authorities have detained a person in connection with the failed times square bombing last saturday .
faisal shahzad is an american citizen of pakistani origin . faisal shahzad has apparently confessed to planting the bomb in times square , but in his home country , pakistan , the reactions vary : some are skeptical and some are in denial . one accountant from karachi is in disbelief : " what evidence do the americans have ?
they could claim anything to blame us pakistanis for acts of terror . "
a business man is of the opinion : " as long as the usa keeps getting involved in our affairs , the taliban will stay involved in theirs . "
among the pakistani people there is a sense of deep animosity towards america and a feeling of being victimized .
nonetheless the pakistani police has arrested numerous people in connection with the attempted attack in new york .
now authorities are working on finding out if faisal shahzad was acting alone or if he was working for a pakistani terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shahzad was taken into custody on monday while trying to board a flight to dubai bomb making classes in pakistan shahzad has reportedly stated he was trained in bomb-making in his home country .
according to statements made by his mother , last year he spent time in northwest pakistan , a stronghold of islamist insurgents .
the group that confessed to the attack is known as the " tehrik-e-taliban pakistan " , but it is still not clear whether or not they are really responsible .
until now they have mainly carried out attacks in pakistan .
but in another video , the leader of the terrorist group , hakimullah mehsud , recently threatened to carry out attacks in american cities .
mehsud was also filmed with a jordanian al qaeda terrorist who was responsible for the deaths of seven cia agents last year in khost , afghanistan .
terrorism beyond the borders so it would seem that tehrik-e-taliban pakistan is looking to expand terrorist activities beyond pakistani borders .
the prohibited group lashkar-e-taiba -lrb- let for short -rrb- is another terrorist group that went beyond the borders .
now it is said they are operating through dummy organizations .
in 2008 they organized the terror attacks in mumbai , in which 175 people were killed .
however , a speaker of the group denies any involvement , stating : neither lashkar-e-taiba nor its founder , hafiz saeed , have anything to do with the mumbai attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombproof courtroom in a mumbai jail where ajmal kasab is being tried but evidence from the trial of the only surviving attacker , ajmal kasab , has proven otherwise .
kasab described in great detail how lashkar-e-taiba recruited and trained him and then sent him to mumbai .

faisal shahzad is an american citizen of pakistani origin . faisal shahzad has apparently confessed to planting the bomb in times square , but in his home country , pakistan , the reactions vary : some are skeptical and some are in denial . one accountant from karachi is in disbelief : " what evidence do the americans have ?
they could claim anything to blame us pakistanis for acts of terror . "
a business man is of the opinion : " as long as the usa keeps getting involved in our affairs , the taliban will stay involved in theirs . "
among the pakistani people there is a sense of deep animosity towards america and a feeling of being victimized .
nonetheless the pakistani police has arrested numerous people in connection with the attempted attack in new york .
now authorities are working on finding out if faisal shahzad was acting alone or if he was working for a pakistani terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shahzad was taken into custody on monday while trying to board a flight to dubai bomb making classes in pakistan shahzad has reportedly stated he was trained in bomb-making in his home country .
according to statements made by his mother , last year he spent time in northwest pakistan , a stronghold of islamist insurgents .
the group that confessed to the attack is known as the " tehrik-e-taliban pakistan " , but it is still not clear whether or not they are really responsible .
until now they have mainly carried out attacks in pakistan .
but in another video , the leader of the terrorist group , hakimullah mehsud , recently threatened to carry out attacks in american cities .
mehsud was also filmed with a jordanian al qaeda terrorist who was responsible for the deaths of seven cia agents last year in khost , afghanistan .
terrorism beyond the borders so it would seem that tehrik-e-taliban pakistan is looking to expand terrorist activities beyond pakistani borders .
the prohibited group lashkar-e-taiba -lrb- let for short -rrb- is another terrorist group that went beyond the borders .
now it is said they are operating through dummy organizations .
in 2008 they organized the terror attacks in mumbai , in which 175 people were killed .
however , a speaker of the group denies any involvement , stating : neither lashkar-e-taiba nor its founder , hafiz saeed , have anything to do with the mumbai attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombproof courtroom in a mumbai jail where ajmal kasab is being tried but evidence from the trial of the only surviving attacker , ajmal kasab , has proven otherwise .
kasab described in great detail how lashkar-e-taiba recruited and trained him and then sent him to mumbai .
before that , the group had carried out other attacks in india , among them on the indian parliament in delhi .
experts also believe that let was planning to carry out an attack on the american embassy in bangladesh in november .
furthermore , david headley , who is currently imprisoned in the united states and , like shahzad , is of pakistani descent , had also been planning attacks on offices and employees of the danish newspaper " jyllands posten " for the let .
the newspaper had become controversial for the printing of cartoons of the prophet muhammad .
ajmal kasab , the mumbai terrorist , was found guilty of all 86 charges in a court in mumbai on monday .
the sentence is due on thursday ; prosecution has called for capital punishment of the 22 -year-old .

the decision has shocked the organizers of the parade and the country 's president . a lithuanian court on wednesday banned a planned gay rights march in a decision which has shocked organizers and the country 's president .
" there 's a constitutional right to peaceful assembly .
if groups of citizens or organisations are n't illegal , they have a right to express their views , " a spokesperson for president dalia grybauskaite told reporters .
the lithuanian attorney general 's office insists security is the only reason it has asked the court to annul a license for what would have been lithuania 's first gay pride march in the capital vilnius .
" whose fault would it be if anyone gets hurt ?
it might look like we are homophobic , but i am not sure if we 'd look better with pictures of violence on tv , " attorney general raimundas petrauskas said .
petrauskas believes radical and violent groups are organizing protests and provocations against the participants of the gay march .
police reaction the police , however , say that they have enough manpower to ensure security .
around 800 police officers were supposed to protect the marchers .
president dalia grybauskaite said she was astounded by what she calls a failure of communication between two of the country 's institutions .
" the bodies responsible for public order , above all the police , have an obligation to ensure a situation remains calm and there are no clashes , " her spokesperson said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania 's president says she is shocked by the court 's decision .
the organizers of the march are shocked by the decision and have applied for an appeal .
but there is next to no chance the appeal can be heard before saturday .
one of the organizers , arturas rudomanskis from the tolerant youth association , says sexual minorities have a constitutional right to peaceful assembly and it is the police who are to blame if they can not guarantee that right . "
i think the president should look carefully to see if she has chosen the right person for the prosecutors office , " rudomanskis told deutsche welle .
" lithuania was able to protect the us president during his visit here and also the british queen .
so why ca n't the country assure the safety of a peaceful meeting by its own citizens ? " he added .
amnesty international has also condemned the court 's decision , saying that it violates human rights .
" the authorities in lithuania must ensure that the march goes ahead unobstructed and safely as they are obliged under international law to guarantee the rights to freedom to expression and assembly , " john dalhuisen , amnesty international 's expert on discrimination in europe said in a statement .
march part of a five-day festival the gay pride parade was only one event in a five-day festival on the subject of equal rights for sexual minorities .
however , the march has sparked a fierce public debate in staunchly catholic lithunia .
several anti-gay protests have been organized and a group of members of parliament has filed a petition against the march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral of vilnius represents the country 's catholic heritage members of the clergy are among the most outspoken critics , insisting that the most important thing is to protect lithuanian families .
" imagine all those wrongdoers in vilnius .
they want to show that their law is above everything .
above the ten commandments , above god , above the history of our nation , " alfonsas svarinskas , a priest , told deutsche welle .
it would have been the first ever gay pride parade in vilnius .
previous attempts to organize gay pride marches were banned by local authorities .
according to a recent eurobarometer survey , lithuanians are the least aware in the european union of the possibility that they may have homosexuals in their own families .

however , the disruption looks set to be far less than last month 's . a fresh volcanic ash cloud forced british and irish air traffic authorities to close parts of their airspace on wednesday , as iceland 's eyjafjallajoekull volcano continued to disrupt european flight paths .
a drifting cloud of ash from the volcano led to flights being halted across most of the continent for almost a week in april .
britain 's civil aviation authority -lrb- caa -rrb- said late on tuesday that air traffic to and from three airports in scotland , including glasgow , would not be allowed as of 6 a.m. gmt wednesday .
the airport in edinburgh , scotland ’ s capital , remained open until midday .
belfast 's airport , in northern ireland , was also closed and flights to and from dublin in the republic of ireland were shut down from 10 a.m.
the irish aviation authority said all airports in ireland could be affected by early afternoon .
" forecasts show that levels of ash in the atmosphere over scotland and northern ireland will exceed the concentrations that engine manufacturers have agreed are safe for operations , " the caa said in a statement .
ash from iceland had caused a similar closure in the same areas from monday until the middle of tuesday this week .
both irish and british authorities fear the volcanic ash , which can damage aircraft engines and instruments when present in large quantities , will spread south during the day , perhaps causing further airport closures in the north of england .
smaller disruptions however , the caa said there was no imminent threat to britain ’ s busiest southern airports , like london 's heathrow and gatwick .
the primary ash cloud from eyjafjallajoekull 's eruption in april brought the majority of european air travel to a standstill for six days , leaving millions of travellers stranded and costing airlines and industry hundreds of millions of euros .
at a meeting on tuesday , european union transport ministers agreed the eu should immediately create a unified air traffic group to ensure member states coordinate their reactions to any similar problems in the future , in a bid to minimize disruptions and costs. msh / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on may 5 , the first-ever echo for jazz is awarded to the vijay iyer trio from new york . it 's the first time the german record industry will present the echo distinctions - until now monopolized by the pop and classical sectors - for jazz , a genre which has been growing in popularity over the past few years . the vijay iyer trio , with stephan crump on bass , marcus gilmore on drums and bandleader vijay iyer on piano , rocked the jazz scene last fall with their new album " historicity . "
it was hailed by critics on both sides of the atlantic as the best jazz cd of 2009 . still , the band was surprised to be selected for the jazz echo award just months later .
they were n't only selected by an expert jury , but also by the music-loving public as reflected in record and down-load sales . " it 's nice to know that there is both a critical embrace and an audience embrace sort of working together , " said iyer . from math to music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iyer links the rational with the emotional in his music band founder vijay iyer is multi-talented .
born the son of indian immigrants to the us , he grew up playing classical violin .
he studied mathematics and physics at yale university and graduated from the university of california at berkeley with a doctorate in arts and technology . during his student days he started playing piano , jammed in jazz clubs , and began exploring composition .
for him , music became the powerhouse of creativity and the means of self-expression that he had been searching for .
but the mathematician in the musician remained . " anything that 's put together with care and precision involves measurement and that 's also true in music , " said iyer .
" you have measurements of time and measurements of frequency or pitch , to perceive music is to perceive order in sound , so when you 're talking about mathematics in music , you 're talking about ordering events . " the trio 's album combines mathematical with spiritual and emotional elements - which iyer said do n't contradict each other but have always coexisted in music . the bedrock of jazz this synthesis of mathematical perfection and deep spirituality has underpinned vijay iyer 's works since the late 1990s .
he has composed for orchestras and string quartets and written ballet scores and movie soundtracks , but his heart belongs to jazz in general and his echo-award-winning trio in particular . for iyer , the genre of the piano trio has been an elemental force in the development of jazz music . " it 's something so deeply explored by so many masters , especially the pianist-composers like duke ellington or herbie nichols - people who had a vision of how music can sound , " said iyer .
" i 'm not caught up in displaying my own virtuosity but i 'm interested in projecting a unity of intent and that 's something the trio can offer . " that " unity of intent " may be difficult to define but is highly apparent when listening to the trio 's music .
vijay iyer is the composer and frontman , but when the band performs , he does not regard himself as a conductor in the classical sense .
improvisation is the life-blood of jazz , he said , but this has to be given a structure created by the composer . " most of the time , when i 'm composing , i 'm setting up a situation for things to happen , so it 's more like architecture , in the sense that i want people to move around in it , " said iyer , " i want people to live and stretch out and be free inside of the space that i 've created . " the audience as a creative force when the vijay iyer trio takes the stage wednesday evening in bochum to pick up the first-ever echo for the best international jazz ensemble , the band says it will be sharing the award with a huge though nameless creative force that has always been behind it : its audiences on both sides of the atlantic . vijay iyer highlighted that the trio is not making music for itself in an aesthetic vacuum , but aims above all to connect with the listeners . " this is something i think is inherent to jazz in particular because there 's so much improvisation involved , there 's really a sense that the music is being created just for that moment and not just for its own sake but for the force of communication and connection , " said the musician . " the more we get back from the audience , the more it impels us to push ourselves and explore and create .

for residents of southern italy , the marsili is just one more disaster threat to live with . just off italy 's southwestern coast , about 450 meters beneath the tyrrhenian sea , lies europe 's largest underwater volcano .
the marsili volcano , which measures 70 kilometers long and 30 kilometers wide , made headlines worldwide recently after geologists uncovered disturbing new information .
new research by the national institute for geophysics and volcanology -lrb- ingv -rrb- in italy , found that the volcano is losing magnetism and that its walls are weakening .
geologists say marsili could collapse at any moment .
if the volcano 's walls were to crumble , it would force thousands of tons of magma into the sea , setting off a tsunami .
" this could happen due to an eruption , seismic events - or another scenario - and these factors can change the equilibrium of the volcano , " said filipo muccini , one of the authors of the report , who is based at the ingv office in the seaside town of fezzano .
geologists can not predict when or how the marsili volcano would erupt , but they predict a tsunami triggered by such an event would hit the coast of southern italy , including the regions of calabria and campania , and the island of sicily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in italy have found that the volcano 's walls are weakening residents of southern italy not alarmed " no one is really aware of the issue and no one really feels threatened , " palermo native elia cusimano told deutsche welle .
" i guess it 's a problem of a lack of information .
but then again , sicily has several other volcanoes . "
southern italians are no strangers to threats of natural disaster .
several active volcanoes can be found in the region , including mount vesuvis , mount stromboli and mount etna in sicily - europe 's largest active volcano .
" every year we get eruptions and the local people seem to have a very strange relationship with the volcano , " said cusimano .
" on the one hand they complain because their houses get destroyed from time to time .
at the same time , they have a really high esteem for the volcano because it brings in a lot of tourism and makes the area really attractive . "
meanwhile , cusimano said residents of catania , the largest town near the etna volcano , feel little threat that their city could go the way of the ancient cities herculaneum and pompeii , which were destroyed by the eruption of the volcano mount vesuvius .
the people of sicily may not worry about volcanic eruptions on a daily basis , but geologists believe the threat presented by the marsili is serious enough to require better observation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the legacy of pompeii , southern italy 's residents stay calm geologists call for closer monitoring though scientists already use a central observatory to observe the volcano , muccini said the station is not equipped to perform real-time checks and only stores and processes data from the sea floor .
but the data compiled so far indicates that the marsili volcano is unique worldwide .
" the drastic decrease that we have recorded on the top of the seamount - especially for the magnetic and gravity field - are , perhaps , considered very exceptional , " said luca cocchi , another author of the marsili volcano report at ingv .
marsili is just one of an estimated 5,000 active submarine volcanoes in the world . although there is evidence that marsili has been active in the past , the volcano has never erupted in recorded history .
according to cocchi , the main obstacle to marsili observation efforts - in the same manner as vesuvius and etna - is funding .
" in the case of the marsili , we know very well its morphology and its evolution , " cocchi said . " but we do n't at this moment if - how and when - it may erupt . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 05.05.2010 biden speech could set the record straight on eu-us relations , say legislators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the expectations are high for joe biden 's speech in brussels in what the white house has billed a major address , us vice president biden will speak at the european parliament on thursday .
members of parliament hope that he will reaffirm us-eu ties - and patch up a few things . members of the european parliament should highlight february 11 , 2010 in their calendars .
it was on that thursday a couple of months ago that they and their institution for the first time appeared in earnest on the radar of most us politicians .
prior to that day and their overwhelming , cross-party rejection of the transfer of financial data to the us under the so-called swift agreement , the european parliament and its work went largely unnoticed in washington .
the swift veto that has left eu and us officials scrambling since then for a replacement agreement served as a wake-up call that a new player with real power had emerged on europe 's political landscape .
that 's certainly true , says elmar brok , chairman of the european parliament delegation with the us and a leading member of the european people 's party .
he adds that washington has realized that the legislature does n't only have overall codecison powers , but also that parliament has to ratify all third country agreements and treaties of the eu .
the message was that in effect , says brok , " nothing can be decided at the end of the day against the will of the european parliament . "
unusual business joe biden 's speech before the european parliament therefore should also be viewed against the backdrop of the body 's newly asserted role .
" it is indeed not everyday business that the vice president of the united states would visit the european parliament and in a way i think the obama administration is paying tribute to the newly enhanced role of the parliament , " says reinhard buetikofer , a member of the delegation with the us and vice-chair of the greens in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament 's veto of the swift agreement put it on the map in washington what 's more , argue brok and buetikofer , biden 's brussel 's speech can serve as an important signal of cooperation between the us and the eu after president barack obama 's decision to cancel his participation in the upcoming bilateral summit in madrid caused some consternation in europe .
buetikofer also hopes that biden , a former senator with vast experience in foreign relations , will set the record straight on europe 's contribution to international security .
refering to a speech us secretary of state hillary clinton gave earlier this year in paris , buetikofer says he was surprised that clinton did n't mention europe 's common foreign and security policy at all .
" so people have wondered , including myself , whether the european contribution to europe 's security , the european engagement in missions like atalanta -lrb- the eu 's anti-piracy operation off the coast of somalia - ed . -rrb- , are at all on the screen in washington . "
so while biden could clearly patch up a few things in european-american affairs , relations between the european parliament and its us counterpart are on a good track since the swift vote . reinvigorate transatlantic dialogue " when we spoke to members of congress in march they explained that the speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , had decided to upgrade the status of the transatlantic legislators dialogue -lrb- tld -rrb- within congress , " says buetikofer .
the tld is a long-standing debate forum for european and us parlamentarians that has effectively been in a deep slumber since its inception - mostly due to a lack of interest from the american side .
now , says brok , is the time to wake it up .
" we have to strengthen the transatlantic legislators dialogue .
we have to work on that in the future and have closer relationships with committees and rapporteurs concerned in order to avoid that we legislate in the us congress or in the european parliament in a way that goes in different directions which would be unhelpful for both sides . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : house speaker nancy pelosi supports stronger ties to european legislators while the house of representatives under the leadership of nancy pelosi has already understood the importance of closer cooperation with european parliamentarians , the us senate is still more reluctant , say brok and buetikofer .
both eu parliamentarians emphasize that striving for closer ties with the us does n't negate reaching out to other countries as well . " however we do see a clear agenda with regard to the transatlantic relationship and it needs some attention , " says buetikofer .
" we should n't let that slip away , just because we believe that asia is coming up strong and that we should also pay attention to that .
i think the parliament has the power and the vision to do both . "

members of parliament hope that he will reaffirm us-eu ties - and patch up a few things . members of the european parliament should highlight february 11 , 2010 in their calendars .
it was on that thursday a couple of months ago that they and their institution for the first time appeared in earnest on the radar of most us politicians .
prior to that day and their overwhelming , cross-party rejection of the transfer of financial data to the us under the so-called swift agreement , the european parliament and its work went largely unnoticed in washington .
the swift veto that has left eu and us officials scrambling since then for a replacement agreement served as a wake-up call that a new player with real power had emerged on europe 's political landscape .
that 's certainly true , says elmar brok , chairman of the european parliament delegation with the us and a leading member of the european people 's party .
he adds that washington has realized that the legislature does n't only have overall codecison powers , but also that parliament has to ratify all third country agreements and treaties of the eu .
the message was that in effect , says brok , " nothing can be decided at the end of the day against the will of the european parliament . "
unusual business joe biden 's speech before the european parliament therefore should also be viewed against the backdrop of the body 's newly asserted role .
" it is indeed not everyday business that the vice president of the united states would visit the european parliament and in a way i think the obama administration is paying tribute to the newly enhanced role of the parliament , " says reinhard buetikofer , a member of the delegation with the us and vice-chair of the greens in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament 's veto of the swift agreement put it on the map in washington what 's more , argue brok and buetikofer , biden 's brussel 's speech can serve as an important signal of cooperation between the us and the eu after president barack obama 's decision to cancel his participation in the upcoming bilateral summit in madrid caused some consternation in europe .
buetikofer also hopes that biden , a former senator with vast experience in foreign relations , will set the record straight on europe 's contribution to international security .
refering to a speech us secretary of state hillary clinton gave earlier this year in paris , buetikofer says he was surprised that clinton did n't mention europe 's common foreign and security policy at all .
" so people have wondered , including myself , whether the european contribution to europe 's security , the european engagement in missions like atalanta -lrb- the eu 's anti-piracy operation off the coast of somalia - ed . -rrb- , are at all on the screen in washington . "
so while biden could clearly patch up a few things in european-american affairs , relations between the european parliament and its us counterpart are on a good track since the swift vote . reinvigorate transatlantic dialogue " when we spoke to members of congress in march they explained that the speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , had decided to upgrade the status of the transatlantic legislators dialogue -lrb- tld -rrb- within congress , " says buetikofer .
the tld is a long-standing debate forum for european and us parlamentarians that has effectively been in a deep slumber since its inception - mostly due to a lack of interest from the american side .
now , says brok , is the time to wake it up .
" we have to strengthen the transatlantic legislators dialogue .
we have to work on that in the future and have closer relationships with committees and rapporteurs concerned in order to avoid that we legislate in the us congress or in the european parliament in a way that goes in different directions which would be unhelpful for both sides . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : house speaker nancy pelosi supports stronger ties to european legislators while the house of representatives under the leadership of nancy pelosi has already understood the importance of closer cooperation with european parliamentarians , the us senate is still more reluctant , say brok and buetikofer .
both eu parliamentarians emphasize that striving for closer ties with the us does n't negate reaching out to other countries as well . " however we do see a clear agenda with regard to the transatlantic relationship and it needs some attention , " says buetikofer .
" we should n't let that slip away , just because we believe that asia is coming up strong and that we should also pay attention to that .
i think the parliament has the power and the vision to do both . "

on may 5 , the first-ever echo for jazz is awarded to the vijay iyer trio from new york . it 's the first time the german record industry will present the echo distinctions - until now monopolized by the pop and classical sectors - for jazz , a genre which has been growing in popularity over the past few years . the vijay iyer trio , with stephan crump on bass , marcus gilmore on drums and bandleader vijay iyer on piano , rocked the jazz scene last fall with their new album " historicity .

it was hailed by critics on both sides of the atlantic as the best jazz cd of 2009 . still , the band was surprised to be selected for the jazz echo award just months later .

on may 5 , the first-ever echo for jazz is awarded to the vijay iyer trio from new york . it 's the first time the german record industry will present the echo distinctions - until now monopolized by the pop and classical sectors - for jazz , a genre which has been growing in popularity over the past few years . the vijay iyer trio , with stephan crump on bass , marcus gilmore on drums and bandleader vijay iyer on piano , rocked the jazz scene last fall with their new album " historicity . "
it was hailed by critics on both sides of the atlantic as the best jazz cd of 2009 . still , the band was surprised to be selected for the jazz echo award just months later .
they were n't only selected by an expert jury , but also by the music-loving public as reflected in record and down-load sales . " it 's nice to know that there is both a critical embrace and an audience embrace sort of working together , " said iyer . from math to music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iyer links the rational with the emotional in his music band founder vijay iyer is multi-talented .
born the son of indian immigrants to the us , he grew up playing classical violin .
he studied mathematics and physics at yale university and graduated from the university of california at berkeley with a doctorate in arts and technology . during his student days he started playing piano , jammed in jazz clubs , and began exploring composition .
for him , music became the powerhouse of creativity and the means of self-expression that he had been searching for .
but the mathematician in the musician remained . " anything that 's put together with care and precision involves measurement and that 's also true in music , " said iyer .
" you have measurements of time and measurements of frequency or pitch , to perceive music is to perceive order in sound , so when you 're talking about mathematics in music , you 're talking about ordering events . " the trio 's album combines mathematical with spiritual and emotional elements - which iyer said do n't contradict each other but have always coexisted in music . the bedrock of jazz this synthesis of mathematical perfection and deep spirituality has underpinned vijay iyer 's works since the late 1990s .
he has composed for orchestras and string quartets and written ballet scores and movie soundtracks , but his heart belongs to jazz in general and his echo-award-winning trio in particular . for iyer , the genre of the piano trio has been an elemental force in the development of jazz music . " it 's something so deeply explored by so many masters , especially the pianist-composers like duke ellington or herbie nichols - people who had a vision of how music can sound , " said iyer .
" i 'm not caught up in displaying my own virtuosity but i 'm interested in projecting a unity of intent and that 's something the trio can offer . " that " unity of intent " may be difficult to define but is highly apparent when listening to the trio 's music .
vijay iyer is the composer and frontman , but when the band performs , he does not regard himself as a conductor in the classical sense .
improvisation is the life-blood of jazz , he said , but this has to be given a structure created by the composer . " most of the time , when i 'm composing , i 'm setting up a situation for things to happen , so it 's more like architecture , in the sense that i want people to move around in it , " said iyer , " i want people to live and stretch out and be free inside of the space that i 've created .

faisal shahzad is an american citizen of pakistani origin . faisal shahzad has apparently confessed to planting the bomb in times square , but in his home country , pakistan , the reactions vary : some are skeptical and some are in denial . one accountant from karachi is in disbelief : " what evidence do the americans have ?
they could claim anything to blame us pakistanis for acts of terror . "
a business man is of the opinion : " as long as the usa keeps getting involved in our affairs , the taliban will stay involved in theirs . "
among the pakistani people there is a sense of deep animosity towards america and a feeling of being victimized .
nonetheless the pakistani police has arrested numerous people in connection with the attempted attack in new york .
now authorities are working on finding out if faisal shahzad was acting alone or if he was working for a pakistani terrorist organization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shahzad was taken into custody on monday while trying to board a flight to dubai bomb making classes in pakistan shahzad has reportedly stated he was trained in bomb-making in his home country .
according to statements made by his mother , last year he spent time in northwest pakistan , a stronghold of islamist insurgents .
the group that confessed to the attack is known as the " tehrik-e-taliban pakistan " , but it is still not clear whether or not they are really responsible .

however , much appears to depend on preventing the type of economic collapse seen in greece from spreading . economic growth in the eu is set to pick up faster than previously expected according to the european commission – provided that the type of economic collapse seen in greece can be kept contained .
the commission on wednesday raised growth predictions for the eurozone to 0.9 percent this year , compared to a 0.7 percent forecast made in february .
however , brussels warned of the potential of a domino effect that could bring down other european economies with high burdens of debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green shoots of recovery are threatened by wider financial collapse the danger posed by wider financial meltdown was likened that of a forest fire by eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn .
" in order to safeguard the economic recovery , which is still rather modest and somewhat fragile , it 's absolutely essential to contain the bushfire in greece so that it will not become a forest fire , " said rehn .
threat to stability the fear of economic contagion constituted a real " threat to financial stability for the european union and its economy as a whole , " rehn stressed .
greece is close to the brink of debt default , requiring a bailout by other members of the european union and the international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece , on the brink of default , has asked for help the forecasts reveal weaknesses in states such as spain , portugal and ireland , which have high debt along with low growth or recession .
spain 's deficit is tipped to hit almost 10 per cent of gross domestic product in 2010 , with the economy shrinking by 0.4 percent .
britain has the highest deficit of the eu countries considered at risk , set to hit 12 percent of gdp in 2010 .
however , the british economy is expected to grow by 1.2 percent during the same period . according to the twice-yearly forecast , growth for the eu as a whole is set to reach 1 per cent this year and 1.7 per cent next year .
growth is expected to be driven by demand from emerging economies such as china and brazil , rather than demand within europe. rc / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , much appears to depend on preventing the type of economic collapse seen in greece from spreading . economic growth in the eu is set to pick up faster than previously expected according to the european commission – provided that the type of economic collapse seen in greece can be kept contained .
the commission on wednesday raised growth predictions for the eurozone to 0.9 percent this year , compared to a 0.7 percent forecast made in february .
however , brussels warned of the potential of a domino effect that could bring down other european economies with high burdens of debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the green shoots of recovery are threatened by wider financial collapse the danger posed by wider financial meltdown was likened that of a forest fire by eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner olli rehn .
" in order to safeguard the economic recovery , which is still rather modest and somewhat fragile , it 's absolutely essential to contain the bushfire in greece so that it will not become a forest fire , " said rehn .
threat to stability the fear of economic contagion constituted a real " threat to financial stability for the european union and its economy as a whole , " rehn stressed .
greece is close to the brink of debt default , requiring a bailout by other members of the european union and the international monetary fund .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece , on the brink of default , has asked for help the forecasts reveal weaknesses in states such as spain , portugal and ireland , which have high debt along with low growth or recession .
spain 's deficit is tipped to hit almost 10 per cent of gross domestic product in 2010 , with the economy shrinking by 0.4 percent .
britain has the highest deficit of the eu countries considered at risk , set to hit 12 percent of gdp in 2010 .
however , the british economy is expected to grow by 1.2 percent during the same period . according to the twice-yearly forecast , growth for the eu as a whole is set to reach 1 per cent this year and 1.7 per cent next year .
growth is expected to be driven by demand from emerging economies such as china and brazil , rather than demand within europe. rc / afp / reuters editor : rob turner send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision has shocked the organizers of the parade and the country 's president . a lithuanian court on wednesday banned a planned gay rights march in a decision which has shocked organizers and the country 's president .
" there 's a constitutional right to peaceful assembly .
if groups of citizens or organisations are n't illegal , they have a right to express their views , " a spokesperson for president dalia grybauskaite told reporters .
the lithuanian attorney general 's office insists security is the only reason it has asked the court to annul a license for what would have been lithuania 's first gay pride march in the capital vilnius .
" whose fault would it be if anyone gets hurt ?
it might look like we are homophobic , but i am not sure if we 'd look better with pictures of violence on tv , " attorney general raimundas petrauskas said .
petrauskas believes radical and violent groups are organizing protests and provocations against the participants of the gay march .
police reaction the police , however , say that they have enough manpower to ensure security .
around 800 police officers were supposed to protect the marchers .
president dalia grybauskaite said she was astounded by what she calls a failure of communication between two of the country 's institutions .
" the bodies responsible for public order , above all the police , have an obligation to ensure a situation remains calm and there are no clashes , " her spokesperson said .

the organizers of the march are shocked by the decision and have applied for an appeal .
but there is next to no chance the appeal can be heard before saturday .
one of the organizers , arturas rudomanskis from the tolerant youth association , says sexual minorities have a constitutional right to peaceful assembly and it is the police who are to blame if they can not guarantee that right . "
i think the president should look carefully to see if she has chosen the right person for the prosecutors office , " rudomanskis told deutsche welle .
" lithuania was able to protect the us president during his visit here and also the british queen .
so why ca n't the country assure the safety of a peaceful meeting by its own citizens ? " he added .
amnesty international has also condemned the court 's decision , saying that it violates human rights .
" the authorities in lithuania must ensure that the march goes ahead unobstructed and safely as they are obliged under international law to guarantee the rights to freedom to expression and assembly , " john dalhuisen , amnesty international 's expert on discrimination in europe said in a statement .
march part of a five-day festival the gay pride parade was only one event in a five-day festival on the subject of equal rights for sexual minorities .
however , the march has sparked a fierce public debate in staunchly catholic lithunia .
several anti-gay protests have been organized and a group of members of parliament has filed a petition against the march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral of vilnius represents the country 's catholic heritage members of the clergy are among the most outspoken critics , insisting that the most important thing is to protect lithuanian families .

the decision has shocked the organizers of the parade and the country 's president . a lithuanian court on wednesday banned a planned gay rights march in a decision which has shocked organizers and the country 's president .
" there 's a constitutional right to peaceful assembly .
if groups of citizens or organisations are n't illegal , they have a right to express their views , " a spokesperson for president dalia grybauskaite told reporters .
the lithuanian attorney general 's office insists security is the only reason it has asked the court to annul a license for what would have been lithuania 's first gay pride march in the capital vilnius .
" whose fault would it be if anyone gets hurt ?
it might look like we are homophobic , but i am not sure if we 'd look better with pictures of violence on tv , " attorney general raimundas petrauskas said .
petrauskas believes radical and violent groups are organizing protests and provocations against the participants of the gay march .
police reaction the police , however , say that they have enough manpower to ensure security .
around 800 police officers were supposed to protect the marchers .
president dalia grybauskaite said she was astounded by what she calls a failure of communication between two of the country 's institutions .
" the bodies responsible for public order , above all the police , have an obligation to ensure a situation remains calm and there are no clashes , " her spokesperson said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lithuania 's president says she is shocked by the court 's decision .
the organizers of the march are shocked by the decision and have applied for an appeal .
but there is next to no chance the appeal can be heard before saturday .
one of the organizers , arturas rudomanskis from the tolerant youth association , says sexual minorities have a constitutional right to peaceful assembly and it is the police who are to blame if they can not guarantee that right . "
i think the president should look carefully to see if she has chosen the right person for the prosecutors office , " rudomanskis told deutsche welle .
" lithuania was able to protect the us president during his visit here and also the british queen .
so why ca n't the country assure the safety of a peaceful meeting by its own citizens ? " he added .
amnesty international has also condemned the court 's decision , saying that it violates human rights .
" the authorities in lithuania must ensure that the march goes ahead unobstructed and safely as they are obliged under international law to guarantee the rights to freedom to expression and assembly , " john dalhuisen , amnesty international 's expert on discrimination in europe said in a statement .
march part of a five-day festival the gay pride parade was only one event in a five-day festival on the subject of equal rights for sexual minorities .
however , the march has sparked a fierce public debate in staunchly catholic lithunia .
several anti-gay protests have been organized and a group of members of parliament has filed a petition against the march .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cathedral of vilnius represents the country 's catholic heritage members of the clergy are among the most outspoken critics , insisting that the most important thing is to protect lithuanian families .
" imagine all those wrongdoers in vilnius .
they want to show that their law is above everything .
above the ten commandments , above god , above the history of our nation , " alfonsas svarinskas , a priest , told deutsche welle .
it would have been the first ever gay pride parade in vilnius .
previous attempts to organize gay pride marches were banned by local authorities .
according to a recent eurobarometer survey , lithuanians are the least aware in the european union of the possibility that they may have homosexuals in their own families .

on may 5 , the first-ever echo for jazz is awarded to the vijay iyer trio from new york . it 's the first time the german record industry will present the echo distinctions - until now monopolized by the pop and classical sectors - for jazz , a genre which has been growing in popularity over the past few years . the vijay iyer trio , with stephan crump on bass , marcus gilmore on drums and bandleader vijay iyer on piano , rocked the jazz scene last fall with their new album " historicity . "
it was hailed by critics on both sides of the atlantic as the best jazz cd of 2009 . still , the band was surprised to be selected for the jazz echo award just months later .
they were n't only selected by an expert jury , but also by the music-loving public as reflected in record and down-load sales . " it 's nice to know that there is both a critical embrace and an audience embrace sort of working together , " said iyer . from math to music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iyer links the rational with the emotional in his music band founder vijay iyer is multi-talented .
born the son of indian immigrants to the us , he grew up playing classical violin .
he studied mathematics and physics at yale university and graduated from the university of california at berkeley with a doctorate in arts and technology . during his student days he started playing piano , jammed in jazz clubs , and began exploring composition .
for him , music became the powerhouse of creativity and the means of self-expression that he had been searching for .
but the mathematician in the musician remained . " anything that 's put together with care and precision involves measurement and that 's also true in music , " said iyer .
" you have measurements of time and measurements of frequency or pitch , to perceive music is to perceive order in sound , so when you 're talking about mathematics in music , you 're talking about ordering events . " the trio 's album combines mathematical with spiritual and emotional elements - which iyer said do n't contradict each other but have always coexisted in music . the bedrock of jazz this synthesis of mathematical perfection and deep spirituality has underpinned vijay iyer 's works since the late 1990s .
he has composed for orchestras and string quartets and written ballet scores and movie soundtracks , but his heart belongs to jazz in general and his echo-award-winning trio in particular . for iyer , the genre of the piano trio has been an elemental force in the development of jazz music . " it 's something so deeply explored by so many masters , especially the pianist-composers like duke ellington or herbie nichols - people who had a vision of how music can sound , " said iyer .
" i 'm not caught up in displaying my own virtuosity but i 'm interested in projecting a unity of intent and that 's something the trio can offer . " that " unity of intent " may be difficult to define but is highly apparent when listening to the trio 's music .
vijay iyer is the composer and frontman , but when the band performs , he does not regard himself as a conductor in the classical sense .
improvisation is the life-blood of jazz , he said , but this has to be given a structure created by the composer . " most of the time , when i 'm composing , i 'm setting up a situation for things to happen , so it 's more like architecture , in the sense that i want people to move around in it , " said iyer , " i want people to live and stretch out and be free inside of the space that i 've created .

members of parliament hope that he will reaffirm us-eu ties - and patch up a few things . members of the european parliament should highlight february 11 , 2010 in their calendars .
it was on that thursday a couple of months ago that they and their institution for the first time appeared in earnest on the radar of most us politicians .
prior to that day and their overwhelming , cross-party rejection of the transfer of financial data to the us under the so-called swift agreement , the european parliament and its work went largely unnoticed in washington .
the swift veto that has left eu and us officials scrambling since then for a replacement agreement served as a wake-up call that a new player with real power had emerged on europe 's political landscape .
that 's certainly true , says elmar brok , chairman of the european parliament delegation with the us and a leading member of the european people 's party .
he adds that washington has realized that the legislature does n't only have overall codecison powers , but also that parliament has to ratify all third country agreements and treaties of the eu .
the message was that in effect , says brok , " nothing can be decided at the end of the day against the will of the european parliament . "
unusual business joe biden 's speech before the european parliament therefore should also be viewed against the backdrop of the body 's newly asserted role .
" it is indeed not everyday business that the vice president of the united states would visit the european parliament and in a way i think the obama administration is paying tribute to the newly enhanced role of the parliament , " says reinhard buetikofer , a member of the delegation with the us and vice-chair of the greens in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament 's veto of the swift agreement put it on the map in washington what 's more , argue brok and buetikofer , biden 's brussel 's speech can serve as an important signal of cooperation between the us and the eu after president barack obama 's decision to cancel his participation in the upcoming bilateral summit in madrid caused some consternation in europe .
buetikofer also hopes that biden , a former senator with vast experience in foreign relations , will set the record straight on europe 's contribution to international security .
refering to a speech us secretary of state hillary clinton gave earlier this year in paris , buetikofer says he was surprised that clinton did n't mention europe 's common foreign and security policy at all .
" so people have wondered , including myself , whether the european contribution to europe 's security , the european engagement in missions like atalanta -lrb- the eu 's anti-piracy operation off the coast of somalia - ed . -rrb- , are at all on the screen in washington . "
so while biden could clearly patch up a few things in european-american affairs , relations between the european parliament and its us counterpart are on a good track since the swift vote . reinvigorate transatlantic dialogue " when we spoke to members of congress in march they explained that the speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , had decided to upgrade the status of the transatlantic legislators dialogue -lrb- tld -rrb- within congress , " says buetikofer .
the tld is a long-standing debate forum for european and us parlamentarians that has effectively been in a deep slumber since its inception - mostly due to a lack of interest from the american side .
now , says brok , is the time to wake it up .
" we have to strengthen the transatlantic legislators dialogue .
we have to work on that in the future and have closer relationships with committees and rapporteurs concerned in order to avoid that we legislate in the us congress or in the european parliament in a way that goes in different directions which would be unhelpful for both sides . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : house speaker nancy pelosi supports stronger ties to european legislators while the house of representatives under the leadership of nancy pelosi has already understood the importance of closer cooperation with european parliamentarians , the us senate is still more reluctant , say brok and buetikofer .
both eu parliamentarians emphasize that striving for closer ties with the us does n't negate reaching out to other countries as well . " however we do see a clear agenda with regard to the transatlantic relationship and it needs some attention , " says buetikofer .
" we should n't let that slip away , just because we believe that asia is coming up strong and that we should also pay attention to that .
i think the parliament has the power and the vision to do both . "

members of parliament hope that he will reaffirm us-eu ties - and patch up a few things . members of the european parliament should highlight february 11 , 2010 in their calendars .
it was on that thursday a couple of months ago that they and their institution for the first time appeared in earnest on the radar of most us politicians .
prior to that day and their overwhelming , cross-party rejection of the transfer of financial data to the us under the so-called swift agreement , the european parliament and its work went largely unnoticed in washington .
the swift veto that has left eu and us officials scrambling since then for a replacement agreement served as a wake-up call that a new player with real power had emerged on europe 's political landscape .
that 's certainly true , says elmar brok , chairman of the european parliament delegation with the us and a leading member of the european people 's party .
he adds that washington has realized that the legislature does n't only have overall codecison powers , but also that parliament has to ratify all third country agreements and treaties of the eu .
the message was that in effect , says brok , " nothing can be decided at the end of the day against the will of the european parliament . "
unusual business joe biden 's speech before the european parliament therefore should also be viewed against the backdrop of the body 's newly asserted role .
" it is indeed not everyday business that the vice president of the united states would visit the european parliament and in a way i think the obama administration is paying tribute to the newly enhanced role of the parliament , " says reinhard buetikofer , a member of the delegation with the us and vice-chair of the greens in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament 's veto of the swift agreement put it on the map in washington what 's more , argue brok and buetikofer , biden 's brussel 's speech can serve as an important signal of cooperation between the us and the eu after president barack obama 's decision to cancel his participation in the upcoming bilateral summit in madrid caused some consternation in europe .
buetikofer also hopes that biden , a former senator with vast experience in foreign relations , will set the record straight on europe 's contribution to international security .
refering to a speech us secretary of state hillary clinton gave earlier this year in paris , buetikofer says he was surprised that clinton did n't mention europe 's common foreign and security policy at all .
" so people have wondered , including myself , whether the european contribution to europe 's security , the european engagement in missions like atalanta -lrb- the eu 's anti-piracy operation off the coast of somalia - ed . -rrb- , are at all on the screen in washington . "
so while biden could clearly patch up a few things in european-american affairs , relations between the european parliament and its us counterpart are on a good track since the swift vote . reinvigorate transatlantic dialogue " when we spoke to members of congress in march they explained that the speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , had decided to upgrade the status of the transatlantic legislators dialogue -lrb- tld -rrb- within congress , " says buetikofer .
the tld is a long-standing debate forum for european and us parlamentarians that has effectively been in a deep slumber since its inception - mostly due to a lack of interest from the american side .
now , says brok , is the time to wake it up .
" we have to strengthen the transatlantic legislators dialogue .
we have to work on that in the future and have closer relationships with committees and rapporteurs concerned in order to avoid that we legislate in the us congress or in the european parliament in a way that goes in different directions which would be unhelpful for both sides . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : house speaker nancy pelosi supports stronger ties to european legislators while the house of representatives under the leadership of nancy pelosi has already understood the importance of closer cooperation with european parliamentarians , the us senate is still more reluctant , say brok and buetikofer .
both eu parliamentarians emphasize that striving for closer ties with the us does n't negate reaching out to other countries as well . " however we do see a clear agenda with regard to the transatlantic relationship and it needs some attention , " says buetikofer .
" we should n't let that slip away , just because we believe that asia is coming up strong and that we should also pay attention to that .
i think the parliament has the power and the vision to do both . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de natural disasters -pipe- 05.05.2010 europe 's largest underwater volcano at risk of collapse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geologists say the underwater volcano marsili is changing the biggest underwater volcano in europe could erupt at any moment and cause a tsunami , according to new research .
for residents of southern italy , the marsili is just one more disaster threat to live with . just off italy 's southwestern coast , about 450 meters beneath the tyrrhenian sea , lies europe 's largest underwater volcano .
the marsili volcano , which measures 70 kilometers long and 30 kilometers wide , made headlines worldwide recently after geologists uncovered disturbing new information .
new research by the national institute for geophysics and volcanology -lrb- ingv -rrb- in italy , found that the volcano is losing magnetism and that its walls are weakening .
geologists say marsili could collapse at any moment .
if the volcano 's walls were to crumble , it would force thousands of tons of magma into the sea , setting off a tsunami .
" this could happen due to an eruption , seismic events - or another scenario - and these factors can change the equilibrium of the volcano , " said filipo muccini , one of the authors of the report , who is based at the ingv office in the seaside town of fezzano .
geologists can not predict when or how the marsili volcano would erupt , but they predict a tsunami triggered by such an event would hit the coast of southern italy , including the regions of calabria and campania , and the island of sicily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in italy have found that the volcano 's walls are weakening residents of southern italy not alarmed " no one is really aware of the issue and no one really feels threatened , " palermo native elia cusimano told deutsche welle .
" i guess it 's a problem of a lack of information .
but then again , sicily has several other volcanoes . "
southern italians are no strangers to threats of natural disaster .
several active volcanoes can be found in the region , including mount vesuvis , mount stromboli and mount etna in sicily - europe 's largest active volcano .
" every year we get eruptions and the local people seem to have a very strange relationship with the volcano , " said cusimano .
" on the one hand they complain because their houses get destroyed from time to time .
at the same time , they have a really high esteem for the volcano because it brings in a lot of tourism and makes the area really attractive . "
meanwhile , cusimano said residents of catania , the largest town near the etna volcano , feel little threat that their city could go the way of the ancient cities herculaneum and pompeii , which were destroyed by the eruption of the volcano mount vesuvius .
the people of sicily may not worry about volcanic eruptions on a daily basis , but geologists believe the threat presented by the marsili is serious enough to require better observation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the legacy of pompeii , southern italy 's residents stay calm geologists call for closer monitoring though scientists already use a central observatory to observe the volcano , muccini said the station is not equipped to perform real-time checks and only stores and processes data from the sea floor .
but the data compiled so far indicates that the marsili volcano is unique worldwide .
" the drastic decrease that we have recorded on the top of the seamount - especially for the magnetic and gravity field - are , perhaps , considered very exceptional , " said luca cocchi , another author of the marsili volcano report at ingv .
marsili is just one of an estimated 5,000 active submarine volcanoes in the world . although there is evidence that marsili has been active in the past , the volcano has never erupted in recorded history .
according to cocchi , the main obstacle to marsili observation efforts - in the same manner as vesuvius and etna - is funding .
" in the case of the marsili , we know very well its morphology and its evolution , " cocchi said . " but we do n't at this moment if - how and when - it may erupt . "

that 's certainly true , says elmar brok , chairman of the european parliament delegation with the us and a leading member of the european people 's party .
he adds that washington has realized that the legislature does n't only have overall codecison powers , but also that parliament has to ratify all third country agreements and treaties of the eu .
the message was that in effect , says brok , " nothing can be decided at the end of the day against the will of the european parliament . "
unusual business joe biden 's speech before the european parliament therefore should also be viewed against the backdrop of the body 's newly asserted role .
" it is indeed not everyday business that the vice president of the united states would visit the european parliament and in a way i think the obama administration is paying tribute to the newly enhanced role of the parliament , " says reinhard buetikofer , a member of the delegation with the us and vice-chair of the greens in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament 's veto of the swift agreement put it on the map in washington what 's more , argue brok and buetikofer , biden 's brussel 's speech can serve as an important signal of cooperation between the us and the eu after president barack obama 's decision to cancel his participation in the upcoming bilateral summit in madrid caused some consternation in europe .
buetikofer also hopes that biden , a former senator with vast experience in foreign relations , will set the record straight on europe 's contribution to international security .
refering to a speech us secretary of state hillary clinton gave earlier this year in paris , buetikofer says he was surprised that clinton did n't mention europe 's common foreign and security policy at all .
" so people have wondered , including myself , whether the european contribution to europe 's security , the european engagement in missions like atalanta -lrb- the eu 's anti-piracy operation off the coast of somalia - ed . -rrb- , are at all on the screen in washington . "
so while biden could clearly patch up a few things in european-american affairs , relations between the european parliament and its us counterpart are on a good track since the swift vote . reinvigorate transatlantic dialogue " when we spoke to members of congress in march they explained that the speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , had decided to upgrade the status of the transatlantic legislators dialogue -lrb- tld -rrb- within congress , " says buetikofer .
the tld is a long-standing debate forum for european and us parlamentarians that has effectively been in a deep slumber since its inception - mostly due to a lack of interest from the american side .
now , says brok , is the time to wake it up .
" we have to strengthen the transatlantic legislators dialogue .
we have to work on that in the future and have closer relationships with committees and rapporteurs concerned in order to avoid that we legislate in the us congress or in the european parliament in a way that goes in different directions which would be unhelpful for both sides . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : house speaker nancy pelosi supports stronger ties to european legislators while the house of representatives under the leadership of nancy pelosi has already understood the importance of closer cooperation with european parliamentarians , the us senate is still more reluctant , say brok and buetikofer .
both eu parliamentarians emphasize that striving for closer ties with the us does n't negate reaching out to other countries as well . " however we do see a clear agenda with regard to the transatlantic relationship and it needs some attention , " says buetikofer .
" we should n't let that slip away , just because we believe that asia is coming up strong and that we should also pay attention to that .
i think the parliament has the power and the vision to do both . "

on may 5 , the first-ever echo for jazz is awarded to the vijay iyer trio from new york . it 's the first time the german record industry will present the echo distinctions - until now monopolized by the pop and classical sectors - for jazz , a genre which has been growing in popularity over the past few years . the vijay iyer trio , with stephan crump on bass , marcus gilmore on drums and bandleader vijay iyer on piano , rocked the jazz scene last fall with their new album " historicity . "
it was hailed by critics on both sides of the atlantic as the best jazz cd of 2009 . still , the band was surprised to be selected for the jazz echo award just months later .
they were n't only selected by an expert jury , but also by the music-loving public as reflected in record and down-load sales . " it 's nice to know that there is both a critical embrace and an audience embrace sort of working together , " said iyer . from math to music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iyer links the rational with the emotional in his music band founder vijay iyer is multi-talented .
born the son of indian immigrants to the us , he grew up playing classical violin .
he studied mathematics and physics at yale university and graduated from the university of california at berkeley with a doctorate in arts and technology . during his student days he started playing piano , jammed in jazz clubs , and began exploring composition .
for him , music became the powerhouse of creativity and the means of self-expression that he had been searching for .
but the mathematician in the musician remained . " anything that 's put together with care and precision involves measurement and that 's also true in music , " said iyer .
" you have measurements of time and measurements of frequency or pitch , to perceive music is to perceive order in sound , so when you 're talking about mathematics in music , you 're talking about ordering events . " the trio 's album combines mathematical with spiritual and emotional elements - which iyer said do n't contradict each other but have always coexisted in music . the bedrock of jazz this synthesis of mathematical perfection and deep spirituality has underpinned vijay iyer 's works since the late 1990s .
he has composed for orchestras and string quartets and written ballet scores and movie soundtracks , but his heart belongs to jazz in general and his echo-award-winning trio in particular . for iyer , the genre of the piano trio has been an elemental force in the development of jazz music . " it 's something so deeply explored by so many masters , especially the pianist-composers like duke ellington or herbie nichols - people who had a vision of how music can sound , " said iyer .
" i 'm not caught up in displaying my own virtuosity but i 'm interested in projecting a unity of intent and that 's something the trio can offer . " that " unity of intent " may be difficult to define but is highly apparent when listening to the trio 's music .
vijay iyer is the composer and frontman , but when the band performs , he does not regard himself as a conductor in the classical sense .
improvisation is the life-blood of jazz , he said , but this has to be given a structure created by the composer . " most of the time , when i 'm composing , i 'm setting up a situation for things to happen , so it 's more like architecture , in the sense that i want people to move around in it , " said iyer , " i want people to live and stretch out and be free inside of the space that i 've created . " the audience as a creative force when the vijay iyer trio takes the stage wednesday evening in bochum to pick up the first-ever echo for the best international jazz ensemble , the band says it will be sharing the award with a huge though nameless creative force that has always been behind it : its audiences on both sides of the atlantic . vijay iyer highlighted that the trio is not making music for itself in an aesthetic vacuum , but aims above all to connect with the listeners . " this is something i think is inherent to jazz in particular because there 's so much improvisation involved , there 's really a sense that the music is being created just for that moment and not just for its own sake but for the force of communication and connection , " said the musician .

" the trio 's album combines mathematical with spiritual and emotional elements - which iyer said do n't contradict each other but have always coexisted in music . the bedrock of jazz this synthesis of mathematical perfection and deep spirituality has underpinned vijay iyer 's works since the late 1990s .
he has composed for orchestras and string quartets and written ballet scores and movie soundtracks , but his heart belongs to jazz in general and his echo-award-winning trio in particular . for iyer , the genre of the piano trio has been an elemental force in the development of jazz music . " it 's something so deeply explored by so many masters , especially the pianist-composers like duke ellington or herbie nichols - people who had a vision of how music can sound , " said iyer .
" i 'm not caught up in displaying my own virtuosity but i 'm interested in projecting a unity of intent and that 's something the trio can offer . " that " unity of intent " may be difficult to define but is highly apparent when listening to the trio 's music .
vijay iyer is the composer and frontman , but when the band performs , he does not regard himself as a conductor in the classical sense .
improvisation is the life-blood of jazz , he said , but this has to be given a structure created by the composer . " most of the time , when i 'm composing , i 'm setting up a situation for things to happen , so it 's more like architecture , in the sense that i want people to move around in it , " said iyer , " i want people to live and stretch out and be free inside of the space that i 've created . " the audience as a creative force when the vijay iyer trio takes the stage wednesday evening in bochum to pick up the first-ever echo for the best international jazz ensemble , the band says it will be sharing the award with a huge though nameless creative force that has always been behind it : its audiences on both sides of the atlantic . vijay iyer highlighted that the trio is not making music for itself in an aesthetic vacuum , but aims above all to connect with the listeners . " this is something i think is inherent to jazz in particular because there 's so much improvisation involved , there 's really a sense that the music is being created just for that moment and not just for its own sake but for the force of communication and connection , " said the musician . " the more we get back from the audience , the more it impels us to push ourselves and explore and create .

members of parliament hope that he will reaffirm us-eu ties - and patch up a few things . members of the european parliament should highlight february 11 , 2010 in their calendars .
it was on that thursday a couple of months ago that they and their institution for the first time appeared in earnest on the radar of most us politicians .
prior to that day and their overwhelming , cross-party rejection of the transfer of financial data to the us under the so-called swift agreement , the european parliament and its work went largely unnoticed in washington .
the swift veto that has left eu and us officials scrambling since then for a replacement agreement served as a wake-up call that a new player with real power had emerged on europe 's political landscape .
that 's certainly true , says elmar brok , chairman of the european parliament delegation with the us and a leading member of the european people 's party .
he adds that washington has realized that the legislature does n't only have overall codecison powers , but also that parliament has to ratify all third country agreements and treaties of the eu .
the message was that in effect , says brok , " nothing can be decided at the end of the day against the will of the european parliament . "
unusual business joe biden 's speech before the european parliament therefore should also be viewed against the backdrop of the body 's newly asserted role .
" it is indeed not everyday business that the vice president of the united states would visit the european parliament and in a way i think the obama administration is paying tribute to the newly enhanced role of the parliament , " says reinhard buetikofer , a member of the delegation with the us and vice-chair of the greens in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament 's veto of the swift agreement put it on the map in washington what 's more , argue brok and buetikofer , biden 's brussel 's speech can serve as an important signal of cooperation between the us and the eu after president barack obama 's decision to cancel his participation in the upcoming bilateral summit in madrid caused some consternation in europe .
buetikofer also hopes that biden , a former senator with vast experience in foreign relations , will set the record straight on europe 's contribution to international security .
refering to a speech us secretary of state hillary clinton gave earlier this year in paris , buetikofer says he was surprised that clinton did n't mention europe 's common foreign and security policy at all .
" so people have wondered , including myself , whether the european contribution to europe 's security , the european engagement in missions like atalanta -lrb- the eu 's anti-piracy operation off the coast of somalia - ed . -rrb- , are at all on the screen in washington . "
so while biden could clearly patch up a few things in european-american affairs , relations between the european parliament and its us counterpart are on a good track since the swift vote . reinvigorate transatlantic dialogue " when we spoke to members of congress in march they explained that the speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , had decided to upgrade the status of the transatlantic legislators dialogue -lrb- tld -rrb- within congress , " says buetikofer .
the tld is a long-standing debate forum for european and us parlamentarians that has effectively been in a deep slumber since its inception - mostly due to a lack of interest from the american side .
now , says brok , is the time to wake it up .
" we have to strengthen the transatlantic legislators dialogue .
we have to work on that in the future and have closer relationships with committees and rapporteurs concerned in order to avoid that we legislate in the us congress or in the european parliament in a way that goes in different directions which would be unhelpful for both sides . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : house speaker nancy pelosi supports stronger ties to european legislators while the house of representatives under the leadership of nancy pelosi has already understood the importance of closer cooperation with european parliamentarians , the us senate is still more reluctant , say brok and buetikofer .
both eu parliamentarians emphasize that striving for closer ties with the us does n't negate reaching out to other countries as well . " however we do see a clear agenda with regard to the transatlantic relationship and it needs some attention , " says buetikofer .
" we should n't let that slip away , just because we believe that asia is coming up strong and that we should also pay attention to that .
i think the parliament has the power and the vision to do both . "

" we should n't let that slip away , just because we believe that asia is coming up strong and that we should also pay attention to that .
i think the parliament has the power and the vision to do both . "

on may 5 , the first-ever echo for jazz is awarded to the vijay iyer trio from new york . it 's the first time the german record industry will present the echo distinctions - until now monopolized by the pop and classical sectors - for jazz , a genre which has been growing in popularity over the past few years . the vijay iyer trio , with stephan crump on bass , marcus gilmore on drums and bandleader vijay iyer on piano , rocked the jazz scene last fall with their new album " historicity . "
it was hailed by critics on both sides of the atlantic as the best jazz cd of 2009 . still , the band was surprised to be selected for the jazz echo award just months later .
they were n't only selected by an expert jury , but also by the music-loving public as reflected in record and down-load sales . " it 's nice to know that there is both a critical embrace and an audience embrace sort of working together , " said iyer . from math to music bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iyer links the rational with the emotional in his music band founder vijay iyer is multi-talented .
born the son of indian immigrants to the us , he grew up playing classical violin .
he studied mathematics and physics at yale university and graduated from the university of california at berkeley with a doctorate in arts and technology . during his student days he started playing piano , jammed in jazz clubs , and began exploring composition .
for him , music became the powerhouse of creativity and the means of self-expression that he had been searching for .
but the mathematician in the musician remained . " anything that 's put together with care and precision involves measurement and that 's also true in music , " said iyer .
" you have measurements of time and measurements of frequency or pitch , to perceive music is to perceive order in sound , so when you 're talking about mathematics in music , you 're talking about ordering events . " the trio 's album combines mathematical with spiritual and emotional elements - which iyer said do n't contradict each other but have always coexisted in music . the bedrock of jazz this synthesis of mathematical perfection and deep spirituality has underpinned vijay iyer 's works since the late 1990s .
he has composed for orchestras and string quartets and written ballet scores and movie soundtracks , but his heart belongs to jazz in general and his echo-award-winning trio in particular . for iyer , the genre of the piano trio has been an elemental force in the development of jazz music .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 05.05.2010 biden speech could set the record straight on eu-us relations , say legislators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the expectations are high for joe biden 's speech in brussels in what the white house has billed a major address , us vice president biden will speak at the european parliament on thursday .
members of parliament hope that he will reaffirm us-eu ties - and patch up a few things . members of the european parliament should highlight february 11 , 2010 in their calendars .
it was on that thursday a couple of months ago that they and their institution for the first time appeared in earnest on the radar of most us politicians .
prior to that day and their overwhelming , cross-party rejection of the transfer of financial data to the us under the so-called swift agreement , the european parliament and its work went largely unnoticed in washington .
the swift veto that has left eu and us officials scrambling since then for a replacement agreement served as a wake-up call that a new player with real power had emerged on europe 's political landscape .
that 's certainly true , says elmar brok , chairman of the european parliament delegation with the us and a leading member of the european people 's party .
he adds that washington has realized that the legislature does n't only have overall codecison powers , but also that parliament has to ratify all third country agreements and treaties of the eu .
the message was that in effect , says brok , " nothing can be decided at the end of the day against the will of the european parliament . "
unusual business joe biden 's speech before the european parliament therefore should also be viewed against the backdrop of the body 's newly asserted role .
" it is indeed not everyday business that the vice president of the united states would visit the european parliament and in a way i think the obama administration is paying tribute to the newly enhanced role of the parliament , " says reinhard buetikofer , a member of the delegation with the us and vice-chair of the greens in the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament 's veto of the swift agreement put it on the map in washington what 's more , argue brok and buetikofer , biden 's brussel 's speech can serve as an important signal of cooperation between the us and the eu after president barack obama 's decision to cancel his participation in the upcoming bilateral summit in madrid caused some consternation in europe .
buetikofer also hopes that biden , a former senator with vast experience in foreign relations , will set the record straight on europe 's contribution to international security .
refering to a speech us secretary of state hillary clinton gave earlier this year in paris , buetikofer says he was surprised that clinton did n't mention europe 's common foreign and security policy at all .
" so people have wondered , including myself , whether the european contribution to europe 's security , the european engagement in missions like atalanta -lrb- the eu 's anti-piracy operation off the coast of somalia - ed . -rrb- , are at all on the screen in washington . "
so while biden could clearly patch up a few things in european-american affairs , relations between the european parliament and its us counterpart are on a good track since the swift vote . reinvigorate transatlantic dialogue " when we spoke to members of congress in march they explained that the speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , had decided to upgrade the status of the transatlantic legislators dialogue -lrb- tld -rrb- within congress , " says buetikofer .
the tld is a long-standing debate forum for european and us parlamentarians that has effectively been in a deep slumber since its inception - mostly due to a lack of interest from the american side .
now , says brok , is the time to wake it up .
" we have to strengthen the transatlantic legislators dialogue .
we have to work on that in the future and have closer relationships with committees and rapporteurs concerned in order to avoid that we legislate in the us congress or in the european parliament in a way that goes in different directions which would be unhelpful for both sides . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : house speaker nancy pelosi supports stronger ties to european legislators while the house of representatives under the leadership of nancy pelosi has already understood the importance of closer cooperation with european parliamentarians , the us senate is still more reluctant , say brok and buetikofer .
both eu parliamentarians emphasize that striving for closer ties with the us does n't negate reaching out to other countries as well . " however we do see a clear agenda with regard to the transatlantic relationship and it needs some attention , " says buetikofer .
" we should n't let that slip away , just because we believe that asia is coming up strong and that we should also pay attention to that .
i think the parliament has the power and the vision to do both . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de natural disasters -pipe- 05.05.2010 europe 's largest underwater volcano at risk of collapse großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : geologists say the underwater volcano marsili is changing the biggest underwater volcano in europe could erupt at any moment and cause a tsunami , according to new research .
for residents of southern italy , the marsili is just one more disaster threat to live with . just off italy 's southwestern coast , about 450 meters beneath the tyrrhenian sea , lies europe 's largest underwater volcano .
the marsili volcano , which measures 70 kilometers long and 30 kilometers wide , made headlines worldwide recently after geologists uncovered disturbing new information .
new research by the national institute for geophysics and volcanology -lrb- ingv -rrb- in italy , found that the volcano is losing magnetism and that its walls are weakening .
geologists say marsili could collapse at any moment .
if the volcano 's walls were to crumble , it would force thousands of tons of magma into the sea , setting off a tsunami .
" this could happen due to an eruption , seismic events - or another scenario - and these factors can change the equilibrium of the volcano , " said filipo muccini , one of the authors of the report , who is based at the ingv office in the seaside town of fezzano .
geologists can not predict when or how the marsili volcano would erupt , but they predict a tsunami triggered by such an event would hit the coast of southern italy , including the regions of calabria and campania , and the island of sicily .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : researchers in italy have found that the volcano 's walls are weakening residents of southern italy not alarmed " no one is really aware of the issue and no one really feels threatened , " palermo native elia cusimano told deutsche welle .
" i guess it 's a problem of a lack of information .
but then again , sicily has several other volcanoes . "
southern italians are no strangers to threats of natural disaster .
several active volcanoes can be found in the region , including mount vesuvis , mount stromboli and mount etna in sicily - europe 's largest active volcano .
" every year we get eruptions and the local people seem to have a very strange relationship with the volcano , " said cusimano .
" on the one hand they complain because their houses get destroyed from time to time .
at the same time , they have a really high esteem for the volcano because it brings in a lot of tourism and makes the area really attractive . "
meanwhile , cusimano said residents of catania , the largest town near the etna volcano , feel little threat that their city could go the way of the ancient cities herculaneum and pompeii , which were destroyed by the eruption of the volcano mount vesuvius .
the people of sicily may not worry about volcanic eruptions on a daily basis , but geologists believe the threat presented by the marsili is serious enough to require better observation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the legacy of pompeii , southern italy 's residents stay calm geologists call for closer monitoring though scientists already use a central observatory to observe the volcano , muccini said the station is not equipped to perform real-time checks and only stores and processes data from the sea floor .
but the data compiled so far indicates that the marsili volcano is unique worldwide .
" the drastic decrease that we have recorded on the top of the seamount - especially for the magnetic and gravity field - are , perhaps , considered very exceptional , " said luca cocchi , another author of the marsili volcano report at ingv .
marsili is just one of an estimated 5,000 active submarine volcanoes in the world . although there is evidence that marsili has been active in the past , the volcano has never erupted in recorded history .
according to cocchi , the main obstacle to marsili observation efforts - in the same manner as vesuvius and etna - is funding .
" in the case of the marsili , we know very well its morphology and its evolution , " cocchi said . " but we do n't at this moment if - how and when - it may erupt . "
