massive amounts of oil are still gushing out and no one , neither bp nor the us government , can do anything about it .
are you astonished that the world 's superpower and one of the biggest oil company 's ca n't stop an oil leak ?
klaus toepfer : definitely .
i am to the utmost surprised .
it is not the only exploration in these depths , there are lots of others and if there is no possibility to stop such a leak then that gives us a totally new impression about the way we produce oil offshore ..
yes , it is more than astonishing that something is licensed when you can not handle a disaster like this .
president barack obama has been harshly criticised for his crisis management with charges that he has acted too late and not strongly enough .
how would you rate obama 's handling of the crisis ?
i think this was really an unexpected development .
that he is doing his utmost right now using not only strong words against bp , but also to integrate all the capacities of the superpower goes withhout saying .
so i would n't criticise him as harshly as he has been criticised by some commentators .
but this is a normal process in an open democratic system and you must be aware of those criticisms and you have to respond to it on a daily basis .
you have to have a clear understanding of the concerns of all the people living in the area most affected by the disaster .
you obviously have to focus on the ecological disaster , but this ecological disaster is linked with huge disaster for the people living in this region who earn their living with tourism , fishing and in other industries .
this serves as an important wake-up call that we now have to hurry up and change our options for producing electricity and energy so that we do n't need to depend any longer on these kinds of risky offshore endeavors .
bp has also been criticised very sharply over its handling and communication of the crisis .
what grade would you give them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toepfer i really believe they lost the control over how to handle the crisis and failed to live up to their responsibilty .
their performance was n't good at all and i am fairly sure that this will have consequences not only within bp , of course it has to start there , but for the industry as a whole .
we have to be aware that this is not only about bp , but there are comparable situations involving others as we saw with the exxon valdez and the disasters off the european coasts .
every crisis is of course an opportunity to learn and change something .
what consequences must be drawn from this crisis now ?
the first and most important consequence is : do your utmost to further develop new energy sources with lower risks .
because if we keep relying on fossil fuels , especially oil , we must recognize that the low-hanging fruits are already harvested and that we will maneuver ourselves into more and more risky and costly situations if we continue to rely on fossil fuels .
so it is high time that we further develop renewable energy and use sun and wind and biomass , geothermal and new energy sources like wave power .
we also have to realize now that the dream that oil is cheap is finally coming to an end .
of course it is easy to point one 's finger at the obama administration and bp for their handling of the crisis .
but are we sure that something like this could n't happen on our own front door in the north sea where there are also oil platforms and drilling ?
have germany and european countries done enough so that something like that ca n't happen there ?
the probability is definitely lower in the north sea .
there are different structures how to operate and handle those risks we saw in the gulf of mexico .
but nobody can be sure that there is zero risk in the north sea and other places in the world as well .
there is a risk , but the probability is much lower .
this oil disaster ranks already as the us ' worst environmental catastrophe in history .
as the un 's former point man on the environment : how bad is this on a global scale ?
this is a problem on a global scale without any doubt .
one should n't exaggerate it , but if you see all the images and pictures one can conclude that this is not just a limited problem in one region of the world , it is a clear signal for the whole world to come to a new assessment about those kinds of drillings and about oil production in general .
it would be a grave mistake to say do n't worry this is only a problem in the gulf of mexico .
klaus toepfer is the founding director of the institute for advanced sustainability studies in potsdam .
from 1998 to 2006 he was executive director of the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- .
prior to that he served as germany 's minister for the env ironment , nature conservation and nuclear safety between 1987 and 1994 .

that is the main finding of a new report presented by the german education ministry . more evidence of the desperate state of germany 's education system was revealed on wednesday , with the pre-publication of statistics from a new " education in germany " report .
according to the report , which is to be presented thursday by the german education ministry and the state conference on education , an assembly of germany 's state education ministers , 17 percent of young germans aged between 20 and 30 have no vocational qualification and are no longer in the education system .
this marks a new high - in 2007 , the figure was still at 15.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezdemir is convinced the problems are endemic the situation is particularly dire among young people with an immigrant background , 30 percent of whom have no formal training and no prospect of achieving further qualifications .
in the face of increasing pressures in the job market , the researchers warned that germany could be facing a long-term unemployment problem for those without formal qualifications .
one forecast predicts that the supply of unqualified workers would exceed the number of jobs in this sector by some 1.3 million for the next 15 years .
for cem oezdemir , education spokesman for the green party , the deficits in germany 's system are appalling .
" we 're talking about a sort of risk-group that leaves school lacking basic reading , writing and arithmetic skills - they are functionally illiterate , " he told deutsche welle .
no surprises problems have been endemic for years , and the report 's findings provide few surprises for those concerned with german education .
stephanie odenwald , director for vocational training at the educational workers ' union gew , said , " it 's not a surprise - everyone who knows the education system has known this problem for years . "
odenwald can also identify one of the main causes of the problem : " it is mainly the fault of the misguided development of this massive transitional system , where young people leave school and do n't get into job training programs and instead get put into these waiting loops , or ' job preparation schemes ' as they are known .
there is a very wide body of opinion that says we need to get rid of this system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with an immigrant background are particularly disadvantaged this transitional system has often been blamed for leaving many of germany 's young people in limbo after leaving school , but oezdemir says that the problems are much deeper .
" what this study makes clear is that we need to question our whole education system - from kindergarten all the way to university , " he said .
" the interim system is just one element of it . "
the sacred cow gymnasium the new report is one of many that have indirectly brought attention to the injustices in germany 's three-tiered school system , which divides students according to ability into one of three different schools after the fourth grade - these are the hauptschule , the realschule and the elite gymnasium .
international comparisons like the pisa studies have highlighted the social inequalities that are caused by this system .
the report shows that hauptschule students continue to have problems finding job training places , even though the competition for them is said to be decreasing .
as far as oezdemir is concerned , germany 's conservative government resists reform because it is clinging to the gymnasium .
" there really is n't a recognition problem , " he says .
" these studies always come out with similar results .
there is an application problem .
we know the problems , but the politicians get bogged down in financial questions , and the taboo of the gymnasium .
the schools need to fit our children , not the other way round . "

this marks a new high - in 2007 , the figure was still at 15.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezdemir is convinced the problems are endemic the situation is particularly dire among young people with an immigrant background , 30 percent of whom have no formal training and no prospect of achieving further qualifications .
in the face of increasing pressures in the job market , the researchers warned that germany could be facing a long-term unemployment problem for those without formal qualifications .
one forecast predicts that the supply of unqualified workers would exceed the number of jobs in this sector by some 1.3 million for the next 15 years .
for cem oezdemir , education spokesman for the green party , the deficits in germany 's system are appalling .
" we 're talking about a sort of risk-group that leaves school lacking basic reading , writing and arithmetic skills - they are functionally illiterate , " he told deutsche welle .
no surprises problems have been endemic for years , and the report 's findings provide few surprises for those concerned with german education .
stephanie odenwald , director for vocational training at the educational workers ' union gew , said , " it 's not a surprise - everyone who knows the education system has known this problem for years . "
odenwald can also identify one of the main causes of the problem : " it is mainly the fault of the misguided development of this massive transitional system , where young people leave school and do n't get into job training programs and instead get put into these waiting loops , or ' job preparation schemes ' as they are known .
there is a very wide body of opinion that says we need to get rid of this system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with an immigrant background are particularly disadvantaged this transitional system has often been blamed for leaving many of germany 's young people in limbo after leaving school , but oezdemir says that the problems are much deeper .
" what this study makes clear is that we need to question our whole education system - from kindergarten all the way to university , " he said .
" the interim system is just one element of it . "
the sacred cow gymnasium the new report is one of many that have indirectly brought attention to the injustices in germany 's three-tiered school system , which divides students according to ability into one of three different schools after the fourth grade - these are the hauptschule , the realschule and the elite gymnasium .
international comparisons like the pisa studies have highlighted the social inequalities that are caused by this system .
the report shows that hauptschule students continue to have problems finding job training places , even though the competition for them is said to be decreasing .
as far as oezdemir is concerned , germany 's conservative government resists reform because it is clinging to the gymnasium .
" there really is n't a recognition problem , " he says .
" these studies always come out with similar results .
there is an application problem .
we know the problems , but the politicians get bogged down in financial questions , and the taboo of the gymnasium .
the schools need to fit our children , not the other way round . "

although food is already in short supply there , local farmers are reluctant to plant new crop varieties that promise better yields . in drought-prone regions of africa , people are often bitterly poor and food is scarce .
unfortunately , the inhabitants of those regions are the very people who , experts say , will be the first to suffer the consequences of climate change .
while droughts used to occur in eastern africa every seven years , they now occur almost every other year .
this negatively impacts food output in the region .
one organization working to improve food security in africa is the coalition for african rice development , which wants to drastically reduce the continent 's reliance on expensive rice imports .
it hopes to develop resilient new rice varieties and distribute them to smallholder farmers , thereby doubling rice production to 28 million tons per annum by the year 2018 .
however , not all farmers are willing to plant modified seeds , whether they be rice , maize or any another crop .
farmers resist change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smallholder maize farms in africa are suffering from less rainfall and higher temperatures christina sabini runs a small farm near morogoro , tanzania with her husband , and says less rain and more heat have reduced harvests during recent years .
like other farmers in the region , sabini says she has no choice but to adapt to the changing climate .
last year , she was offered new tan250 maize seeds , which were researched and tested in kenya and zimbabwe .
" these seeds are better because they also survive droughts , and they do provide good yields .
even without using fertilizer , i can reap good maize , " she said .
sabini was one of the few regional farmers who chose to accept the seeds , and she believes she made the right decision .
others were more conservative and continued using the traditional varieties .
according to cynthia awuor , a climate expert with the non-governmental organization care in kenya , developing drought-resistant seeds is only half the challenge faced by those whose want to curb world hunger by increasing crop yields .
convincing farmers to voluntarily change their habits and plant the new seeds can be very difficult .
" there 's much more exploration into drought tolerant species of maize as well as other crops .
at the same time , we are trying to promote crop varieties and seed varieties that were traditionally drought tolerant .
so we 're encouraging farmers to go into planting more and more sorghum , for example , and cassava , which are traditionally drought tolerant types of crops , " awuor told deutsche welle .
modified crops are slow to catch on but awuor and her organization are not the first to encounter resistance to modified crop varieties .
in the 1990 's , scientists cross bred a high-yield variety of asian rice with a stress-resistant african one .
the result was nerica , tough and locally adapted rice best suited for the highland or dry land environments which account for about 70 percent of africa 's rice farms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased food production may save lives as climate change progresses many farmers have been able to double their harvests , thanks to the new rice , but nerica did n't catch on until more than 80 varieties and thousands of lines were developed to cater to regions in 20 african countries .
thomas yanga works for the united nation 's world food program , where he is responsible for west africa .
he is well aware of the attitudes of farmers in his home country of cameroon .
" i know from my own village that the people are very , very attached to the taste of certain commodities .
and for them the taste is more important than anything else .
any new variety that does not give them the same taste , they will reject , " he told deutsche welle .
monty jones from sierra leone was awarded the world food prize six years ago for his role in developing nerica .
while he is proud of the rich harvest reaped from the new rice variety , he is worried about the impact of climate change in the future .
" at a certain level of distress – whether it 's drought , whether it 's flooding , whether it 's salinity – every material will break down .
basically , what we can do is to increase the level of resistance or tolerance to these problems , " he told deutsche welle .

although food is already in short supply there , local farmers are reluctant to plant new crop varieties that promise better yields . in drought-prone regions of africa , people are often bitterly poor and food is scarce .
unfortunately , the inhabitants of those regions are the very people who , experts say , will be the first to suffer the consequences of climate change .
while droughts used to occur in eastern africa every seven years , they now occur almost every other year .
this negatively impacts food output in the region .
one organization working to improve food security in africa is the coalition for african rice development , which wants to drastically reduce the continent 's reliance on expensive rice imports .
it hopes to develop resilient new rice varieties and distribute them to smallholder farmers , thereby doubling rice production to 28 million tons per annum by the year 2018 .
however , not all farmers are willing to plant modified seeds , whether they be rice , maize or any another crop .
farmers resist change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smallholder maize farms in africa are suffering from less rainfall and higher temperatures christina sabini runs a small farm near morogoro , tanzania with her husband , and says less rain and more heat have reduced harvests during recent years .
like other farmers in the region , sabini says she has no choice but to adapt to the changing climate .
last year , she was offered new tan250 maize seeds , which were researched and tested in kenya and zimbabwe .
" these seeds are better because they also survive droughts , and they do provide good yields .
even without using fertilizer , i can reap good maize , " she said .
sabini was one of the few regional farmers who chose to accept the seeds , and she believes she made the right decision .
others were more conservative and continued using the traditional varieties .
according to cynthia awuor , a climate expert with the non-governmental organization care in kenya , developing drought-resistant seeds is only half the challenge faced by those whose want to curb world hunger by increasing crop yields .
convincing farmers to voluntarily change their habits and plant the new seeds can be very difficult .
" there 's much more exploration into drought tolerant species of maize as well as other crops .
at the same time , we are trying to promote crop varieties and seed varieties that were traditionally drought tolerant .
so we 're encouraging farmers to go into planting more and more sorghum , for example , and cassava , which are traditionally drought tolerant types of crops , " awuor told deutsche welle .
modified crops are slow to catch on but awuor and her organization are not the first to encounter resistance to modified crop varieties .
in the 1990 's , scientists cross bred a high-yield variety of asian rice with a stress-resistant african one .
the result was nerica , tough and locally adapted rice best suited for the highland or dry land environments which account for about 70 percent of africa 's rice farms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased food production may save lives as climate change progresses many farmers have been able to double their harvests , thanks to the new rice , but nerica did n't catch on until more than 80 varieties and thousands of lines were developed to cater to regions in 20 african countries .
thomas yanga works for the united nation 's world food program , where he is responsible for west africa .
he is well aware of the attitudes of farmers in his home country of cameroon .
" i know from my own village that the people are very , very attached to the taste of certain commodities .
and for them the taste is more important than anything else .
any new variety that does not give them the same taste , they will reject , " he told deutsche welle .
monty jones from sierra leone was awarded the world food prize six years ago for his role in developing nerica .
while he is proud of the rich harvest reaped from the new rice variety , he is worried about the impact of climate change in the future .
" at a certain level of distress – whether it 's drought , whether it 's flooding , whether it 's salinity – every material will break down .
basically , what we can do is to increase the level of resistance or tolerance to these problems , " he told deutsche welle .

but dams and manmade reservoirs also encroach upon humans , wildlife and natural habitats .
a company based in south western germany that specializes in making high-performance pumps is currently testing a solution that can use the power of the river without affecting its ecosystem .
dieter-heinz hellmann , member of the ksb board of management , will present the operating principle of the new river turbine at this year ’ s deutsche welle global media forum in bonn , germany .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
ksb engineers turned a basic principle on its head .
bchanging the direction of flow , a pump can be used as a turbine and vice versa .
in other words , by introducing flow to a pump propeller in reverse , it begins rotating and turns the pump into a turbine .
the motor then behaves like a generator and the pump produces electricity .
a seven-meter-long river turbine prototype has been operating since march 2010 in a tributary of the rhine river near st. goar , where it produces hydroelectricity without any disruptive dam constructions .
only a few buoys bob on the surface , indicating the location of the turbine .
initial tests have shown that the ksb turbine neither interferes with the river ’ s ecosystem nor impedes the migratory routes of fish .
engineers at the ksb group think that their innovation could revolutionize the use of hydropower .
trial operation is scheduled to take an ambitious plunge this summer when a single river turbine will be used to convert the currents of the rhine into electricity to power ten households . more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .

but the band do have one thing in common with the world ’ s most famous book : a knowledge that big things are going to happen . abel & cain 's lead singer chris blöcher is sure that pretty soon there 'll come a time when stadium crowds are singing along to their songs .
" basically we ’ re ready for our time , our d-day in the music scene if you like , " he said , " that ’ s the only thing we want to do and we 're giving it our all to make sure it happens . "
quite ambitious , one might think , to compare their musical breakthrough with the normandy landings , but these aren ’ t empty words .
marek and chris have already enjoyed a taste of success with their previous band atemlos .
they scored three sizable chart hits , shot a bunch of music videos and were even featured on german music tv channel viva .
but despite their burgeoning popularity , they decided the direction the band was heading in just was n't them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : front man chris onstage a knack for pathos they let the atemlos project fold and switched to singing in english with the formation of abel & cain .
they 're not shy about citing big guns like oasis and coldplay as influences ; their music is rock with an emotional slant … and not necessarily always with positive origins .
" all these emotional songs and melodies actually originate from certain feelings of rage , " explains chris , " not necessarily against things which you have done wrong yourself but things that are or were frustrating and which play off each other .
we see ourselves as headed in a direction which will allow us to say we can be free to do what we want . "
their journey to fame and fortune has seen them successfully complete a stint at popcamp , an intense band coaching boot camp organized by the german music council , and put the finishing touches to the recordings for their debut album .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popcamp is a high-level band coaching project sponsored by the german music council all set for the international market chris is actually dreaming of a future where he isn ’ t chained to germany : " i 'd like to be somewhere where no one knows who i am , where i do n't know anyone , where i 'd never know what might happen when i walk around the corner .
that ’ s what i want . "
in order to accomplish that , he 's ditched the idea of singing in german with the view that english songs fare better internationally than german ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today the clubs , tomorrow the stadiums ?
the five year plan abel & cain are n't dreaming of success ; as far as the four guys from düsseldorf are concerned , they 're already convinced it 's going to happen and that this is the right time .
at the moment , they 're all working flat out towards this goal so much so that chris knows exactly where he sees the band in five years ' time .
" i want to see the music we make mature and to see it develop into something round and perfect , " he adds , " i can picture way more live shows , touring our third album . i can really see us doing well in this business .
in fact , i can ’ t imagine anything else . "

earlier , in group h , switzerland shocked spain 1-0 , while chile overcame honduras by the same score line . uruguay have beaten south africa 3-0 in the second round of group a games at the world cup , pushing the south americans up to four points and leaving bafana bafana languishing on one point .
south africa started the game with energy and tight passing , taking it to the uruguayan defense .
however the dominant possession did n't pay dividends for the hosts , when uruguay scored in the 23rd minute through a looping shot from outside the box by atletico madrid striker diego forlan .
the ball tucked under the crossbar and into the back of the net , leaving south african keeper itumeleng khune helpless .
the goal did n't have a huge impact on south africa 's composure , but from that point onwards the possession balanced out and uruguay was allowed more time in their attacking third .
uruguay started the second half a different team , keeping the south african defense under pressure for the opening 15 minutes .
south africa seemed somewhat lackluster with the ball and were unable to threaten their opponent 's goal until the 65th minute after a cross from the right by siboniso gaxa to the near post met katlego mphela 's head , though the forward pushed the ball wide .
the death knell for south africa came in the 76th minute when khune was red carded for bringing down ajax striker luis suarez in the box after he was clear on goal .
forlan coolly smashed home the resultant penalty kick .
uruguay made it 3-0 with a close-range header from alvaro pereira deep in injury time from a suarez cross .
south africa must now hope for a win next tuesday against france if they are to have any hope of progressing to the round of 16 .
shock in nelspruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland upset spain , who were title favorites in wednesday 's afternoon match , european title holders spain were toppled in their first world cup match after going down 1-0 in a shock loss to ottmar hitzfeld ’ s switzerland .
the swiss took the lead in the 52nd minute through a scrappy goal against the run of play from gelson fernandes , who picked up a loose ball after spanish keeper iker casillas collided with eren derdiyok in the box .
xavi alonso went closest to equalizing for the spaniards in the 70th minute when his shot from the edge of the box rebounded off the crossbar .
switzerland nearly went 2-0 up four minutes later when derdiyok weaved past two men in the box and struck the right post after a deft shot with the outside of his right boot .
the victory is the first for switzerland over spain in 19 meetings and represents by far the greatest upset so far in the world cup in south africa .
spain dominated possession in the first 45 minutes , getting most of their team behind the ball .
the best chance fell to gerard pique , who cut back inside swiss defender stephane grichting but saw his shot rebound off the legs of keeper diego benaglio .
despite showing sparks of brilliance with the ball , spain rarely threatened during the half , while switzerland , too , lacked any real scoring opportunities .
vicente del bosque 's spain , which , going into the tournament , was among the teams most favored to lift the world cup , were expected to come away with all three points against switzerland .
victory after 48 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beausejour -lrb- in red -rrb- shoots to score past honduras goalkeeper noel valladares in the day 's opening group h match , chile ended a 48-year winless streak in the world cup by overcoming honduras 1-0 at mbombela stadium in nelspruit .
striker jean beausejour bagged the only goal of the game .
in a game which it dominated , chile were unlucky not to extend their lead after man-of-the-match beausejour 's 34th minute strike .
the goal followed some slick passing in the honduran box which created space for mauricio isla on the right flank to get a low cross in at the near post , which was turned in by the mexico-based beausejour .
chile defender waldo ponce came forward for a free kick midway through the second half and should have doubled the lead only for veteran goalie noel valladares to parry away a diving point-blank header .
midfielder jorge valdivia had another chance at the goal 15 minutes from full-time , but was correctly flagged offside as the " killer " second goal continued to elude chile .

south africa started the game with energy and tight passing , taking it to the uruguayan defense .
however the dominant possession did n't pay dividends for the hosts , when uruguay scored in the 23rd minute through a looping shot from outside the box by atletico madrid striker diego forlan .
the ball tucked under the crossbar and into the back of the net , leaving south african keeper itumeleng khune helpless .
the goal did n't have a huge impact on south africa 's composure , but from that point onwards the possession balanced out and uruguay was allowed more time in their attacking third .
uruguay started the second half a different team , keeping the south african defense under pressure for the opening 15 minutes .
south africa seemed somewhat lackluster with the ball and were unable to threaten their opponent 's goal until the 65th minute after a cross from the right by siboniso gaxa to the near post met katlego mphela 's head , though the forward pushed the ball wide .
the death knell for south africa came in the 76th minute when khune was red carded for bringing down ajax striker luis suarez in the box after he was clear on goal .
forlan coolly smashed home the resultant penalty kick .
uruguay made it 3-0 with a close-range header from alvaro pereira deep in injury time from a suarez cross .
south africa must now hope for a win next tuesday against france if they are to have any hope of progressing to the round of 16 .
shock in nelspruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland upset spain , who were title favorites in wednesday 's afternoon match , european title holders spain were toppled in their first world cup match after going down 1-0 in a shock loss to ottmar hitzfeld ’ s switzerland .
the swiss took the lead in the 52nd minute through a scrappy goal against the run of play from gelson fernandes , who picked up a loose ball after spanish keeper iker casillas collided with eren derdiyok in the box .
xavi alonso went closest to equalizing for the spaniards in the 70th minute when his shot from the edge of the box rebounded off the crossbar .
switzerland nearly went 2-0 up four minutes later when derdiyok weaved past two men in the box and struck the right post after a deft shot with the outside of his right boot .
the victory is the first for switzerland over spain in 19 meetings and represents by far the greatest upset so far in the world cup in south africa .
spain dominated possession in the first 45 minutes , getting most of their team behind the ball .
the best chance fell to gerard pique , who cut back inside swiss defender stephane grichting but saw his shot rebound off the legs of keeper diego benaglio .
despite showing sparks of brilliance with the ball , spain rarely threatened during the half , while switzerland , too , lacked any real scoring opportunities .
vicente del bosque 's spain , which , going into the tournament , was among the teams most favored to lift the world cup , were expected to come away with all three points against switzerland .
victory after 48 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beausejour -lrb- in red -rrb- shoots to score past honduras goalkeeper noel valladares in the day 's opening group h match , chile ended a 48-year winless streak in the world cup by overcoming honduras 1-0 at mbombela stadium in nelspruit .
striker jean beausejour bagged the only goal of the game .
in a game which it dominated , chile were unlucky not to extend their lead after man-of-the-match beausejour 's 34th minute strike .
the goal followed some slick passing in the honduran box which created space for mauricio isla on the right flank to get a low cross in at the near post , which was turned in by the mexico-based beausejour .
chile defender waldo ponce came forward for a free kick midway through the second half and should have doubled the lead only for veteran goalie noel valladares to parry away a diving point-blank header .
midfielder jorge valdivia had another chance at the goal 15 minutes from full-time , but was correctly flagged offside as the " killer " second goal continued to elude chile .

mineral resources worth about a trillion dollars have been found in afghanistan .
these include gold , iron , cobalt and lithium . the report about the pentagon 's huge afghan mineral finds and their economic potential has attracted a lot of attention in afghanistan .
many are upbeat about it .
abdurrahman ashraf , the advisor to president hamid karzai on mining issues , says that his government will conduct an in-depth investigation to verify the information .
" we have been given data which are necessary for the mining of the resources .
we will work with that , " he says .
" we will take samples on the ground and find out the mineral content of various deposits .
then we can say which deposits are economically worthwhile and which are not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president karzai 's government is conducting an investigation into the mineral deposits the information is not ' new ' the us government 's supposedly new information about the mineral riches is in fact not that new .
during the occupation of afghanistan in the 1980s , soviet geologists had already explored the soil and collected data .
after the withdrawal of the red army , afghan geologists hid the maps which their soviet colleagues had left behind .
the information remained under wraps until the western forces drove the taliban out of kabul in 2001 . the white house in washington seemed to have not known about the mineral resources until recently , when an internal memo by the us department of defense said the value of the deposits in afghanistan was about a trillion dollars .

some believe that the white house is trying to show us citizens that their soldiers are not fighting in vain , and that a lot of money is involved here .
economist sayhoon believes there could be other motives as well : " the us is warning us afghans and suggesting to us to consider exploiting and using these mineral resources .
moreover , the news is meant to attract the attention of western companies .

" the mining and sale of these mineral resources require special expertise , which we do not have right now , " he says .
" moreover , our generation has not the right to sell everything . "
ashraf also suggests that afghans might prefer to sell the valuable mineral resources to china or india rather than to western buyers . experts however see such a statement as an attempt by the kabul government to use afghanistan 's mineral resources as an asset and to pit the west , china and india against each other - while keeping all options open . authors : arif farahmand , cem sey / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

cologne-based deg , part of the kfw banking group , lead the realization of the project .
bruno wenn , chairman of the board of management at deg will present this flagship project at the deutsche welle global media forum .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
within the framework of german development work , deg is responsible for financing investments of private companies for projects in developing and transition countries .
an example from the realm of climate change is the olkaria iii geothermal plant in kenya .
wenn says that the climate change debate has been shaped by the role of the public sector .
“ the participation of the private sector has mostly been missing in public discussions until now , ” he says .
for olkaria iii , 105 million dollars -lrb- us -rrb- were provided by outside financing .
deg ’ s requirements : the project must be “ operational , profitable , environmental and socially acceptable ” .
wenn is convinced that olkaria iii can be a glowing example for making climate projects profitable .
however , he also says that the private infrastructures that exist in developing countries are a major challenge .
when working on olkaria iii , deg benefited from kfw ’ s cooperation with the state-run power company in kenya , in order to get more investors on board .
wenn states that geothermal energy isn ’ t a futuristic vision .
“ the capacity in 2008 was just behind solar energy worldwide .
there is a lot of potential in the americas and in asia , ” says wenn .
“ the usa is currently the largest consumer of geothermal energy , followed by the philippines , indonesia and mexico . ”
it could also be important in africa .
“ olkaria iii is like the core in africa for further development in the region and a big step forward . ”
in bonn , wenn will make it clear that all stakeholders must reach a “ long-term , global agreement regarding the general conditions about climate change and the prevention of future greenhouse gas emissions . ”
more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .
deutsche welle is cooperating with many different organizations for this interdisciplinary conference , including the unesco , the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the international human dimensions program on global environmental change -lrb- un ihdp / essp -rrb- , eu commission and the world bank , the wuppertal institute , world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , nabu and the climate alliance , the institute for world business kiel , german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- , the center for development research -lrb- zef -rrb- and many others .

the artist talked with deutsche welle about some of the big ideas behind them . contemporary installation artist christo turns 75 this week , less than a year after the loss of his wife and artistic partner jeanne-claude .
deutsche welle spoke with christo about how he is moving forward with his work and what he thinks about its reception .
two museums in germany - the kunsthalle wuerth and the max ernst museum in bruehl - are currently displaying some of his works .
deutsche welle : you had such a symbiotic relationship with jeanne-claude .
how is it for you to continue work now on the projects you had planned together ?
christo : we always knew that one of us would be the first to go , and we 've known that for almost the last 50 years .
ever since we met in 1958 , we 've always traveled in separate planes so that one of us would be able to finish the work we started .
so , everything was in some way already prepared .
these projects take so long to get permission and to realize that we always envisioned this was possible .
many people struggle to understand the concept that you do n't work for money .
what does it say about our society that people have so much trouble grasping that you do art simply to create new art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wrapped reichstag " -lrb- 1995 -rrb- was realized 24 years after its conception this relates to the way i was brought up and educated in bulgaria under communism .
basically , the projects deal in large part with freedom .
of course , i do make money by selling the preparatory drawings and studies for the projects .
on paper , i put down my visions , jeanne-claude 's visions , our visions .
i also produce a variety of tangible goods to create the funds necessary to build projects that can not be bought and can not be owned - even jeanne-claude and i do n't own them .
the projects are about freedom .
freedom is the enemy of possession , and possession is equal to permanence .
you know , humans like to be in the presence of things that are unique like they are - things that wo n't happen again .
the projects have a quality of fragility and tenderness , like our own lives or our own childhood .
they can not be substituted or repeated .
but how much of a problem do you think our society has in understanding what you 're trying to do with your work ?
i would never think about that myself .
we like to build these projects because we enjoy it for ourselves , like any true artist .
any artist - an abstract painter , a watercolorist , whoever - enjoys and lives to do the work .
the projects begin from an almost visceral desire to realize something because you think it 's beautiful .
if somebody likes the work , it 's almost like a bonus - an additional dimension .
these projects deal with a very wide variety of aesthetic dimensions .
a 3-d work of art is different from a painting with a flat surface .
with a sculpture , you can move around it , you perceive the volume and dimensions .
but all of that space is entirely designed by the artist , who exercises an absurd amount of control over the space .
now , there 's another space we think very little about .
the moment you walk out of your home , somebody else designed the sidewalk , the roads and the lights .
basically 24 hours a day , we 're in a highly planned space that we do n't even think about .
in our work , we more or less borrow that space and create a gentle disturbance for a few days .
by doing so , we inherit everything inherent to that space , and it becomes a part of the work of art .
you just turned 75 .
that 's significant in many ways , is n't it ?

i 've lived in the same building for 46 years .
i climb 90 steps about 15 times a day - i do n't have an elevator .
do you perhaps want to do something permanent at this stage in your life ?
i do a lot of things that are permanent - a lot of drawings , sketches , collages , and sculptures .
they 're permanent and in museums .
i 'm not against the idea of things existing permanently .
for instance , each time a big project is finished and removed , it has its own documentation exhibition that tells the story of the project .
there are scale models , cables , fabric , and samples .
these exhibitions do not substitute for the projects .
they 're about the projects .
but through them , you should see connections to all the works - they 're connected , they 're not separate .
the reality of these large projects is that there are so many different levels of perception involved .
i think this is the body of our work together - it can not be separate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 16.06.2010 installation artist christo says freedom is the enemy of possession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and wife jeanne-claude worked together for decades christo 's installations are often larger than life : a huge sheet covering the german parliament or islands surrounded by floating fabric .
the artist talked with deutsche welle about some of the big ideas behind them . contemporary installation artist christo turns 75 this week , less than a year after the loss of his wife and artistic partner jeanne-claude .
deutsche welle spoke with christo about how he is moving forward with his work and what he thinks about its reception .
two museums in germany - the kunsthalle wuerth and the max ernst museum in bruehl - are currently displaying some of his works .
deutsche welle : you had such a symbiotic relationship with jeanne-claude .
how is it for you to continue work now on the projects you had planned together ?
christo : we always knew that one of us would be the first to go , and we 've known that for almost the last 50 years .
ever since we met in 1958 , we 've always traveled in separate planes so that one of us would be able to finish the work we started .
so , everything was in some way already prepared .
these projects take so long to get permission and to realize that we always envisioned this was possible .
many people struggle to understand the concept that you do n't work for money .
what does it say about our society that people have so much trouble grasping that you do art simply to create new art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wrapped reichstag " -lrb- 1995 -rrb- was realized 24 years after its conception this relates to the way i was brought up and educated in bulgaria under communism .
basically , the projects deal in large part with freedom .
of course , i do make money by selling the preparatory drawings and studies for the projects .
on paper , i put down my visions , jeanne-claude 's visions , our visions .
i also produce a variety of tangible goods to create the funds necessary to build projects that can not be bought and can not be owned - even jeanne-claude and i do n't own them .
the projects are about freedom .
freedom is the enemy of possession , and possession is equal to permanence .
you know , humans like to be in the presence of things that are unique like they are - things that wo n't happen again .
the projects have a quality of fragility and tenderness , like our own lives or our own childhood .
they can not be substituted or repeated .
but how much of a problem do you think our society has in understanding what you 're trying to do with your work ?
i would never think about that myself .
we like to build these projects because we enjoy it for ourselves , like any true artist .
any artist - an abstract painter , a watercolorist , whoever - enjoys and lives to do the work .
the projects begin from an almost visceral desire to realize something because you think it 's beautiful .
if somebody likes the work , it 's almost like a bonus - an additional dimension .
these projects deal with a very wide variety of aesthetic dimensions .
a 3-d work of art is different from a painting with a flat surface .
with a sculpture , you can move around it , you perceive the volume and dimensions .
but all of that space is entirely designed by the artist , who exercises an absurd amount of control over the space .
now , there 's another space we think very little about .
the moment you walk out of your home , somebody else designed the sidewalk , the roads and the lights .
basically 24 hours a day , we 're in a highly planned space that we do n't even think about .
in our work , we more or less borrow that space and create a gentle disturbance for a few days .
by doing so , we inherit everything inherent to that space , and it becomes a part of the work of art .
you just turned 75 .
that 's significant in many ways , is n't it ?

i 've lived in the same building for 46 years .
i climb 90 steps about 15 times a day - i do n't have an elevator .
do you perhaps want to do something permanent at this stage in your life ?
i do a lot of things that are permanent - a lot of drawings , sketches , collages , and sculptures .
they 're permanent and in museums .
i 'm not against the idea of things existing permanently .
for instance , each time a big project is finished and removed , it has its own documentation exhibition that tells the story of the project .
there are scale models , cables , fabric , and samples .
these exhibitions do not substitute for the projects .
they 're about the projects .
but through them , you should see connections to all the works - they 're connected , they 're not separate .
the reality of these large projects is that there are so many different levels of perception involved .
i think this is the body of our work together - it can not be separate .

trade unions are up in arms about the plan . french workers are facing the prospect of having to work for two more years before qualifying for a pension , as the minimum retirement age is set to rise to 62 .
details of the planned change , which was expected to meet strong resistance from trade unions , were announced by french labor minister eric woerth . " working longer is inevitable , " woerth told reporters following a meeting with president nicolas sarkozy on tuesday .
" there is not a magical solution . "
" all of our partners in europe have done it .
it is no longer possible to stay on the sidelines of this movement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woerth announced the plans after a meeting with president sarkozy on tuesday , tens of thousands of people demonstrated against the reforms in the runup to the announcement .
police said that 23,000 people took part in a march in paris , with union officials putting the figure at 70,000 .
future protests promised a bill on the changes is to be presented to the french cabinet in july before going before parliament in september .
unions have promised that they will fight the reforms with demonstrations and strikes .
the french government is introducing the changes , to be fully implemented by 2018 , in bid to trim spending on welfare and preserve its credit rating .
the right to a pension from the age of 60 has been part of the french system since 1982 .
under the present system , individuals can draw a full pension from the age of 60 provided that they have paid social security contributions for a minimum of 40 years and six months .
the reforms would also change the contribution period to 41 years .

massive amounts of oil are still gushing out and no one , neither bp nor the us government , can do anything about it .
are you astonished that the world 's superpower and one of the biggest oil company 's ca n't stop an oil leak ?
klaus toepfer : definitely .
i am to the utmost surprised .
it is not the only exploration in these depths , there are lots of others and if there is no possibility to stop such a leak then that gives us a totally new impression about the way we produce oil offshore ..
yes , it is more than astonishing that something is licensed when you can not handle a disaster like this .
president barack obama has been harshly criticised for his crisis management with charges that he has acted too late and not strongly enough .
how would you rate obama 's handling of the crisis ?
i think this was really an unexpected development .
that he is doing his utmost right now using not only strong words against bp , but also to integrate all the capacities of the superpower goes withhout saying .
so i would n't criticise him as harshly as he has been criticised by some commentators .
but this is a normal process in an open democratic system and you must be aware of those criticisms and you have to respond to it on a daily basis .
you have to have a clear understanding of the concerns of all the people living in the area most affected by the disaster .
you obviously have to focus on the ecological disaster , but this ecological disaster is linked with huge disaster for the people living in this region who earn their living with tourism , fishing and in other industries .
this serves as an important wake-up call that we now have to hurry up and change our options for producing electricity and energy so that we do n't need to depend any longer on these kinds of risky offshore endeavors .
bp has also been criticised very sharply over its handling and communication of the crisis .
what grade would you give them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toepfer i really believe they lost the control over how to handle the crisis and failed to live up to their responsibilty .
their performance was n't good at all and i am fairly sure that this will have consequences not only within bp , of course it has to start there , but for the industry as a whole .
we have to be aware that this is not only about bp , but there are comparable situations involving others as we saw with the exxon valdez and the disasters off the european coasts .
every crisis is of course an opportunity to learn and change something .
what consequences must be drawn from this crisis now ?
the first and most important consequence is : do your utmost to further develop new energy sources with lower risks .
because if we keep relying on fossil fuels , especially oil , we must recognize that the low-hanging fruits are already harvested and that we will maneuver ourselves into more and more risky and costly situations if we continue to rely on fossil fuels .
so it is high time that we further develop renewable energy and use sun and wind and biomass , geothermal and new energy sources like wave power .
we also have to realize now that the dream that oil is cheap is finally coming to an end .
of course it is easy to point one 's finger at the obama administration and bp for their handling of the crisis .
but are we sure that something like this could n't happen on our own front door in the north sea where there are also oil platforms and drilling ?
have germany and european countries done enough so that something like that ca n't happen there ?
the probability is definitely lower in the north sea .
there are different structures how to operate and handle those risks we saw in the gulf of mexico .
but nobody can be sure that there is zero risk in the north sea and other places in the world as well .
there is a risk , but the probability is much lower .
this oil disaster ranks already as the us ' worst environmental catastrophe in history .
as the un 's former point man on the environment : how bad is this on a global scale ?
this is a problem on a global scale without any doubt .
one should n't exaggerate it , but if you see all the images and pictures one can conclude that this is not just a limited problem in one region of the world , it is a clear signal for the whole world to come to a new assessment about those kinds of drillings and about oil production in general .
it would be a grave mistake to say do n't worry this is only a problem in the gulf of mexico .
klaus toepfer is the founding director of the institute for advanced sustainability studies in potsdam .
from 1998 to 2006 he was executive director of the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- .
prior to that he served as germany 's minister for the env ironment , nature conservation and nuclear safety between 1987 and 1994 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : oil spill in the gulf of mexico the oil disaster the world prefers to ignore americans vent anger over oil spill differently from europeans obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist full oil spill compensation looks increasingly unlikely disasters -pipe- 16.06.2010 bp oil spill must have global consequences , says former un expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neither bp nor the us government has been able to plug the leak in an interview with deutsche welle , the former director of the un 's environment program expresses his astonishment that the oil leak ca n't be stopped and demands consequences both at bp and beyond . deutsche welle : weeks after the explosion of the oil rig in the gulf of mexico it seems there is hardly any progress being made .
massive amounts of oil are still gushing out and no one , neither bp nor the us government , can do anything about it .
are you astonished that the world 's superpower and one of the biggest oil company 's ca n't stop an oil leak ?
klaus toepfer : definitely .
i am to the utmost surprised .
it is not the only exploration in these depths , there are lots of others and if there is no possibility to stop such a leak then that gives us a totally new impression about the way we produce oil offshore ..
yes , it is more than astonishing that something is licensed when you can not handle a disaster like this .
president barack obama has been harshly criticised for his crisis management with charges that he has acted too late and not strongly enough .
how would you rate obama 's handling of the crisis ?
i think this was really an unexpected development .
that he is doing his utmost right now using not only strong words against bp , but also to integrate all the capacities of the superpower goes withhout saying .
so i would n't criticise him as harshly as he has been criticised by some commentators .
but this is a normal process in an open democratic system and you must be aware of those criticisms and you have to respond to it on a daily basis .
you have to have a clear understanding of the concerns of all the people living in the area most affected by the disaster .
you obviously have to focus on the ecological disaster , but this ecological disaster is linked with huge disaster for the people living in this region who earn their living with tourism , fishing and in other industries .
this serves as an important wake-up call that we now have to hurry up and change our options for producing electricity and energy so that we do n't need to depend any longer on these kinds of risky offshore endeavors .
bp has also been criticised very sharply over its handling and communication of the crisis .
what grade would you give them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toepfer i really believe they lost the control over how to handle the crisis and failed to live up to their responsibilty .
their performance was n't good at all and i am fairly sure that this will have consequences not only within bp , of course it has to start there , but for the industry as a whole .
we have to be aware that this is not only about bp , but there are comparable situations involving others as we saw with the exxon valdez and the disasters off the european coasts .
every crisis is of course an opportunity to learn and change something .
what consequences must be drawn from this crisis now ?
the first and most important consequence is : do your utmost to further develop new energy sources with lower risks .
because if we keep relying on fossil fuels , especially oil , we must recognize that the low-hanging fruits are already harvested and that we will maneuver ourselves into more and more risky and costly situations if we continue to rely on fossil fuels .
so it is high time that we further develop renewable energy and use sun and wind and biomass , geothermal and new energy sources like wave power .
we also have to realize now that the dream that oil is cheap is finally coming to an end .
of course it is easy to point one 's finger at the obama administration and bp for their handling of the crisis .
but are we sure that something like this could n't happen on our own front door in the north sea where there are also oil platforms and drilling ?
have germany and european countries done enough so that something like that ca n't happen there ?
the probability is definitely lower in the north sea .
there are different structures how to operate and handle those risks we saw in the gulf of mexico .
but nobody can be sure that there is zero risk in the north sea and other places in the world as well .
there is a risk , but the probability is much lower .
this oil disaster ranks already as the us ' worst environmental catastrophe in history .
as the un 's former point man on the environment : how bad is this on a global scale ?
this is a problem on a global scale without any doubt .
one should n't exaggerate it , but if you see all the images and pictures one can conclude that this is not just a limited problem in one region of the world , it is a clear signal for the whole world to come to a new assessment about those kinds of drillings and about oil production in general .
it would be a grave mistake to say do n't worry this is only a problem in the gulf of mexico .
klaus toepfer is the founding director of the institute for advanced sustainability studies in potsdam .
from 1998 to 2006 he was executive director of the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- .
prior to that he served as germany 's minister for the env ironment , nature conservation and nuclear safety between 1987 and 1994 .

dw-world.de obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist us president obama has televised his tough stance against bp as oil continues to leak into the gulf of mexico .
but it 's unclear what legal mechanisms he can use to force the company to pay full compensation .
-lrb- 16.06.2010 -rrb- americans vent anger over oil spill differently than europeans compared to earlier oil disasters in europe where thousands took to the streets , the outcry in the us over the bp spill seems rather restrained .
but the lack of mass rallies should n't be seen as a lack of public anger .

but the band do have one thing in common with the world ’ s most famous book : a knowledge that big things are going to happen . abel & cain 's lead singer chris blöcher is sure that pretty soon there 'll come a time when stadium crowds are singing along to their songs .
" basically we ’ re ready for our time , our d-day in the music scene if you like , " he said , " that ’ s the only thing we want to do and we 're giving it our all to make sure it happens . "
quite ambitious , one might think , to compare their musical breakthrough with the normandy landings , but these aren ’ t empty words .
marek and chris have already enjoyed a taste of success with their previous band atemlos .
they scored three sizable chart hits , shot a bunch of music videos and were even featured on german music tv channel viva .
but despite their burgeoning popularity , they decided the direction the band was heading in just was n't them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : front man chris on stage a knack for pathos they let the atemlos project fold and switched to singing in english with the formation of abel & cain .
they 're not shy about citing big guns like oasis and coldplay as influences ; their music is rock with an emotional slant … and not necessarily always with positive origins .
" all these emotional songs and melodies actually originate from certain feelings of rage , " explains chris , " not necessarily against things which you have done wrong yourself but things that are or were frustrating and which play off each other .
we see ourselves as headed in a direction which will allow us to say we can be free to do what we want . "
their journey to fame and fortune has seen them successfully complete a stint at popcamp , an intense band coaching boot camp organized by the german music council , and put the finishing touches to the recordings for their debut album .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popcamp is a high-level band coaching project sponsored by the german music council all set for the international market chris is actually dreaming of a future where he isn ’ t chained to germany : " i 'd like to be somewhere where no one knows who i am , where i do n't know anyone , where i 'd never know what might happen when i walk around the corner .
that ’ s what i want . "
in order to accomplish that , he 's ditched the idea of singing in german with the view that english songs fare better internationally than german ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today the clubs , tomorrow the stadiums ?
the five year plan abel & cain are n't dreaming of success ; as far as the four guys from düsseldorf are concerned , they 're already convinced it 's going to happen and that this is the right time .
at the moment , they 're all working flat out towards this goal so much so that chris knows exactly where he sees the band in five years ' time .
" i want to see the music we make mature and to see it develop into something round and perfect , " he adds , " i can picture way more live shows , touring our third album . i can really see us doing well in this business .
in fact , i can ’ t imagine anything else . "

gm also said that no further layoffs at opel were on the cards . us auto giant general motors has dropped its request for financial backing from european governments for its carmaker opel , saying it would restructure its european subsidiary itself .
further layoffs at opel have also been shelved .
opel said in a statement that it laid blame for the back flip on the lengthy process of obtaining government loan guarantees from germany , britain , spain , poland , austria and belgium - in which it employs some 48,000 workers altogether .
britain and spain had offered loan guarantees , but gm would now do without any government help .
" the validity and reasons for requesting government guarantees have ... not changed but the process has proven to be much more complex and longer than anticipated , " the firm said in a statement .
" gm 's recently improved financial strength has also been a catalyst for making this decision . "
the move comes as a surprise after gm for months insisted it needed european governments to pitch in to restructure opel .
no more layoffs opel said there would be no layoffs or plant closures beyond those already announced at the beginning of this year .
those measures called for opel to lose 8,300 workers in europe and close a plant in belgium .
gm had asked the european governments for 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees to restructure opel .
last week , germany , home to 23,000 opel employees , categorically ruled out providing its share of the guarantee - estimated at 1.1 billion euros - saying that gm had enough money of its own .
however , the four german states which have opel plants were looking at whether they could step in and at least partly fill the gap .
chief executive nick reilly has been pushing for a plan to invest 11 billion euros in the company until 2014 , updating 80 per cent of the opel model range .

many thousands of refugees are fleeing the ethnic clashes , with the united nations warning of a possible humanitarian catastrophe . ethnic groups in kyrgyzstan clashed again in overnight battles as the official death toll in the country rose to at least 179 , according to a report by the kyrgyz news agency akipress , quoting the health ministry . the ministry said that it expected the actual number of dead to be much higher . troops were patrolling streets in the city of osh on wednesday morning , following clashes between kyrgyz groups and the uzbek minority .
the number of civilians forced to flee the violence is now put at 275,000 according to the united nations high commission for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- . united nations children 's fund unicef reports that women , children and the elderly make up more than 90 percent of the refugees .
the situation was growing increasingly serious , the head of the unhcr said on wednesday . " what is happening is already a tragedy and it could become a catastrophe . "
antonio guterres said during a visit to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic uzbeks have been gathering near the kyrgyz-uzbek border " we urgently need to find a political solution ... the country 's neighbors and the international community must do everything in their power to help the interim kyrgyz government restore peace and stability , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
officials in kyrgyzstan have warned that the ethnic conflict could spread to the country 's north and neighboring countries as aid agencies attempt to cope with the humanitarian crisis in the central asian country .
some 2,000 people have been wounded in the fighting which erupted last thursday , according to official figures .
violence in the southern cities of osh and jalalabad has raised fears over the future stability of the country of 5.3 million , where uzbeks make up 14 percent of the population .
aid groups working overtime uzbekistan has been struggling to deal with a flood of ethnic refugees who crossed the border to escape the unrest .
with around 75,000 refugees already inside uzbekistan after fleeing the southern cities , authorities said they had closed off the border to prevent that number from swelling .
however the office of the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , which has been working to get relief supplies into the central asian countries , told deutsche welle it understood the border has now been reopened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations high commissioner for refugees , antonio guterres , warned of catastrophe " we have this understanding that the border is open .
we understand that yesterday it was closed temporarily for the night and now it is open , " says unhcr spokesperson babar baloch .
" the un high commissioner here in geneva , antonio guterres , has welcomed the uzbek authorities ' decision to open the border and welcome refugees who are seeking asylum in uzbekistan . "
baloch says that the unhcr plans to send six relief planes in total with 240 metric tons of supplies to uzbekistan in the coming days .
he said this would be followed by more aid once the unhcr had established a presence on the ground .
baloch added that the unhcr had been experiencing problems in reaching displaced peoples in areas around osh because of the security situation .
" we had hoped to be able to reach those people .
we have some stocks on the ground at the unhcr warehouse there in osh and we already have been in touch with the icrc -lrb- international committee of the red cross -rrb- to distribute the items we have there , but we understand and we are concerned at the poor security situation in osh and jalalabad and other areas which is impeding aid delivery . "
bildunterschrift : bodies litter the street as houses burn in jalabad military intervention meanwhile , roza otunbayeva , the interim president of kyrgyzstan , said on tuesday that there was no reason for russia to intervene by deploying peacekeepers to the crisis region .
she said the clashes were beginning to wane and that she hoped that her country 's own forces could get the situation under control .
moscow says it considers the violence in southern kyrgyzstan an internal matter for that country and has only sent several hundred troops to defend a russian military base in kyrgyzstan .
both russia and the united states have military installations in the central asian country , with the us using the strategic position as a hub to support its forces in afghanistan .
otunbayeva also said a planned constitutional referendum would go ahead on june 27 .
she was speaking at a press conference after the eu had warned that the violent clashes threatened to derail the country 's reform process .
however this view is not shared by icrc head of operations for central asia and eastern europe , pascale meige wagner , who warned " we 're far from seeing the end of this crisis . "
" we hear extremely worrying stories about people targeted - there is a will to harm and kill in kyrgzystan . "

but the band do have one thing in common with the world ’ s most famous book : a knowledge that big things are going to happen . abel & cain 's lead singer chris blöcher is sure that pretty soon there 'll come a time when stadium crowds are singing along to their songs .
" basically we ’ re ready for our time , our d-day in the music scene if you like , " he said , " that ’ s the only thing we want to do and we 're giving it our all to make sure it happens . "
quite ambitious , one might think , to compare their musical breakthrough with the normandy landings , but these aren ’ t empty words .
marek and chris have already enjoyed a taste of success with their previous band atemlos .
they scored three sizable chart hits , shot a bunch of music videos and were even featured on german music tv channel viva .
but despite their burgeoning popularity , they decided the direction the band was heading in just was n't them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : front man chris onstage a knack for pathos they let the atemlos project fold and switched to singing in english with the formation of abel & cain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 16.06.2010 newer crop varieties could check world hunger but meet with resistance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nerica rice can thrive in drought-prone environments drought-prone regions of africa are likely to be hard-hit as climate change continues .
although food is already in short supply there , local farmers are reluctant to plant new crop varieties that promise better yields . in drought-prone regions of africa , people are often bitterly poor and food is scarce .
unfortunately , the inhabitants of those regions are the very people who , experts say , will be the first to suffer the consequences of climate change .
while droughts used to occur in eastern africa every seven years , they now occur almost every other year .
this negatively impacts food output in the region .
one organization working to improve food security in africa is the coalition for african rice development , which wants to drastically reduce the continent 's reliance on expensive rice imports .
it hopes to develop resilient new rice varieties and distribute them to smallholder farmers , thereby doubling rice production to 28 million tons per annum by the year 2018 .
however , not all farmers are willing to plant modified seeds , whether they be rice , maize or any another crop .
farmers resist change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smallholder maize farms in africa are suffering from less rainfall and higher temperatures christina sabini runs a small farm near morogoro , tanzania with her husband , and says less rain and more heat have reduced harvests during recent years .
like other farmers in the region , sabini says she has no choice but to adapt to the changing climate .
last year , she was offered new tan250 maize seeds , which were researched and tested in kenya and zimbabwe .
" these seeds are better because they also survive droughts , and they do provide good yields .
even without using fertilizer , i can reap good maize , " she said .
sabini was one of the few regional farmers who chose to accept the seeds , and she believes she made the right decision .
others were more conservative and continued using the traditional varieties .
according to cynthia awuor , a climate expert with the non-governmental organization care in kenya , developing drought-resistant seeds is only half the challenge faced by those whose want to curb world hunger by increasing crop yields .
convincing farmers to voluntarily change their habits and plant the new seeds can be very difficult .
" there 's much more exploration into drought tolerant species of maize as well as other crops .
at the same time , we are trying to promote crop varieties and seed varieties that were traditionally drought tolerant .
so we 're encouraging farmers to go into planting more and more sorghum , for example , and cassava , which are traditionally drought tolerant types of crops , " awuor told deutsche welle .
modified crops are slow to catch on but awuor and her organization are not the first to encounter resistance to modified crop varieties .
in the 1990 's , scientists cross bred a high-yield variety of asian rice with a stress-resistant african one .
the result was nerica , tough and locally adapted rice best suited for the highland or dry land environments which account for about 70 percent of africa 's rice farms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased food production may save lives as climate change progresses many farmers have been able to double their harvests , thanks to the new rice , but nerica did n't catch on until more than 80 varieties and thousands of lines were developed to cater to regions in 20 african countries .
thomas yanga works for the united nation 's world food program , where he is responsible for west africa .
he is well aware of the attitudes of farmers in his home country of cameroon .
" i know from my own village that the people are very , very attached to the taste of certain commodities .
and for them the taste is more important than anything else .
any new variety that does not give them the same taste , they will reject , " he told deutsche welle .
monty jones from sierra leone was awarded the world food prize six years ago for his role in developing nerica .
while he is proud of the rich harvest reaped from the new rice variety , he is worried about the impact of climate change in the future .
" at a certain level of distress – whether it 's drought , whether it 's flooding , whether it 's salinity – every material will break down .
basically , what we can do is to increase the level of resistance or tolerance to these problems , " he told deutsche welle .

although food is already in short supply there , local farmers are reluctant to plant new crop varieties that promise better yields . in drought-prone regions of africa , people are often bitterly poor and food is scarce .
unfortunately , the inhabitants of those regions are the very people who , experts say , will be the first to suffer the consequences of climate change .
while droughts used to occur in eastern africa every seven years , they now occur almost every other year .
this negatively impacts food output in the region .
one organization working to improve food security in africa is the coalition for african rice development , which wants to drastically reduce the continent 's reliance on expensive rice imports .
it hopes to develop resilient new rice varieties and distribute them to smallholder farmers , thereby doubling rice production to 28 million tons per annum by the year 2018 .
however , not all farmers are willing to plant modified seeds , whether they be rice , maize or any another crop .
farmers resist change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smallholder maize farms in africa are suffering from less rainfall and higher temperatures christina sabini runs a small farm near morogoro , tanzania with her husband , and says less rain and more heat have reduced harvests during recent years .
like other farmers in the region , sabini says she has no choice but to adapt to the changing climate .
last year , she was offered new tan250 maize seeds , which were researched and tested in kenya and zimbabwe .
" these seeds are better because they also survive droughts , and they do provide good yields .
even without using fertilizer , i can reap good maize , " she said .
sabini was one of the few regional farmers who chose to accept the seeds , and she believes she made the right decision .
others were more conservative and continued using the traditional varieties .
according to cynthia awuor , a climate expert with the non-governmental organization care in kenya , developing drought-resistant seeds is only half the challenge faced by those whose want to curb world hunger by increasing crop yields .
convincing farmers to voluntarily change their habits and plant the new seeds can be very difficult .
" there 's much more exploration into drought tolerant species of maize as well as other crops .
at the same time , we are trying to promote crop varieties and seed varieties that were traditionally drought tolerant .

gm also said that no further layoffs at opel were on the cards . us auto giant general motors has dropped its request for financial backing from european governments for its carmaker opel , saying it would restructure its european subsidiary itself .
further layoffs at opel have also been shelved .
opel said in a statement that it laid blame for the back flip on the lengthy process of obtaining government loan guarantees from germany , britain , spain , poland , austria and belgium - in which it employs some 48,000 workers altogether .
britain and spain had offered loan guarantees , but gm would now do without any government help .
" the validity and reasons for requesting government guarantees have ... not changed but the process has proven to be much more complex and longer than anticipated , " the firm said in a statement .
" gm 's recently improved financial strength has also been a catalyst for making this decision . "
the move comes as a surprise after gm for months insisted it needed european governments to pitch in to restructure opel .
no more layoffs opel said there would be no layoffs or plant closures beyond those already announced at the beginning of this year .
those measures called for opel to lose 8,300 workers in europe and close a plant in belgium .
gm had asked the european governments for 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees to restructure opel .
last week , germany , home to 23,000 opel employees , categorically ruled out providing its share of the guarantee - estimated at 1.1 billion euros - saying that gm had enough money of its own .
however , the four german states which have opel plants were looking at whether they could step in and at least partly fill the gap .
chief executive nick reilly has been pushing for a plan to invest 11 billion euros in the company until 2014 , updating 80 per cent of the opel model range .

many thousands of refugees are fleeing the ethnic clashes , with the united nations warning of a possible humanitarian catastrophe . ethnic groups in kyrgyzstan clashed again in overnight battles as the official death toll in the country rose to at least 179 , according to a report by the kyrgyz news agency akipress , quoting the health ministry . the ministry said that it expected the actual number of dead to be much higher . troops were patrolling streets in the city of osh on wednesday morning , following clashes between kyrgyz groups and the uzbek minority .
the number of civilians forced to flee the violence is now put at 275,000 according to the united nations high commission for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- . united nations children 's fund unicef reports that women , children and the elderly make up more than 90 percent of the refugees .
the situation was growing increasingly serious , the head of the unhcr said on wednesday . " what is happening is already a tragedy and it could become a catastrophe . "
antonio guterres said during a visit to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic uzbeks have been gathering near the kyrgyz-uzbek border " we urgently need to find a political solution ... the country 's neighbors and the international community must do everything in their power to help the interim kyrgyz government restore peace and stability , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
officials in kyrgyzstan have warned that the ethnic conflict could spread to the country 's north and neighboring countries as aid agencies attempt to cope with the humanitarian crisis in the central asian country .
some 2,000 people have been wounded in the fighting which erupted last thursday , according to official figures .
violence in the southern cities of osh and jalalabad has raised fears over the future stability of the country of 5.3 million , where uzbeks make up 14 percent of the population .
aid groups working overtime uzbekistan has been struggling to deal with a flood of ethnic refugees who crossed the border to escape the unrest .
with around 75,000 refugees already inside uzbekistan after fleeing the southern cities , authorities said they had closed off the border to prevent that number from swelling .
however the office of the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , which has been working to get relief supplies into the central asian countries , told deutsche welle it understood the border has now been reopened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations high commissioner for refugees , antonio guterres , warned of catastrophe " we have this understanding that the border is open .
we understand that yesterday it was closed temporarily for the night and now it is open , " says unhcr spokesperson babar baloch .
" the un high commissioner here in geneva , antonio guterres , has welcomed the uzbek authorities ' decision to open the border and welcome refugees who are seeking asylum in uzbekistan . "
baloch says that the unhcr plans to send six relief planes in total with 240 metric tons of supplies to uzbekistan in the coming days .
he said this would be followed by more aid once the unhcr had established a presence on the ground .
baloch added that the unhcr had been experiencing problems in reaching displaced peoples in areas around osh because of the security situation .
" we had hoped to be able to reach those people .
we have some stocks on the ground at the unhcr warehouse there in osh and we already have been in touch with the icrc -lrb- international committee of the red cross -rrb- to distribute the items we have there , but we understand and we are concerned at the poor security situation in osh and jalalabad and other areas which is impeding aid delivery . "
bildunterschrift : bodies litter the street as houses burn in jalabad military intervention meanwhile , roza otunbayeva , the interim president of kyrgyzstan , said on tuesday that there was no reason for russia to intervene by deploying peacekeepers to the crisis region .
she said the clashes were beginning to wane and that she hoped that her country 's own forces could get the situation under control .
moscow says it considers the violence in southern kyrgyzstan an internal matter for that country and has only sent several hundred troops to defend a russian military base in kyrgyzstan .
both russia and the united states have military installations in the central asian country , with the us using the strategic position as a hub to support its forces in afghanistan .
otunbayeva also said a planned constitutional referendum would go ahead on june 27 .
she was speaking at a press conference after the eu had warned that the violent clashes threatened to derail the country 's reform process .
however this view is not shared by icrc head of operations for central asia and eastern europe , pascale meige wagner , who warned " we 're far from seeing the end of this crisis . "
" we hear extremely worrying stories about people targeted - there is a will to harm and kill in kyrgzystan . "

now , according to india 's official press information bureau , afghanistan has invited india to invest in its mining sector , particularly in mining iron ore , copper , gold and coal . during a visit to india on tuesday , afghanistan 's mines minister wahidullah shahrani also sought india 's know-how in the field of mineral exploration .
he also said that afghanistan will launch a road show in london on june 25 , in which about 200 companies from across the globe will be invited to showcase their mining and exploration potential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's mines minister wahidullah shahrani india needs minerals and metals experts say resource-hungry india is not likely to forgo any opportunity to extract afghanistan 's untapped valuable mineral deposits , which also include lithium , a key material used in a wide range of consumer products . " india is an expanding economy and our requirements for different types of minerals will go up , " says santosh kumar , a former indian diplomat in new delhi .
" india is among the leading technological countries in the world .
and in those technologies like for example aerospace and so on , there are new metals and new applications for these metals required .
since we do n't have these metals and rare earths in india , some of them we import , so obviously any discoveries in our neighborhood would be of interest to us .

one is the security situation .
the second is that these minerals are found in parts which are not well connected .
so transport is a critical issue . " following the attacks that killed seven indians in kabul earlier this year , new delhi has often expressed worries over the security of its nationals in afghanistan . many observers in the us also believe that security problems , weak infrastructure and corruption will be a hindrance for digging up the mineral riches .
there are also concerns that the taliban could intensify their campaign now that they know that afghanistan is sitting on a goldmine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chinese delegation visiting the site of a copper mine in aynak in 2007 china and pakistan but given the scale of afghanistan 's mineral wealth , many may not hesitate to take a risk .

ye hailin , an expert from the chinese academy of social sciences , is cautious though .
" why would you connect this news with china ?
the us is the major player in afghanistan .
one should ask , what sort of new strategy can the united states plan now . " and what about afghanistan 's immediate neighbor pakistan ?
shahid kardar , a pakistani economist , believes that pakistan would rather be interested in providing logistical support than going for full-fledged investment . " i do n't think we will ever be in a position to be a serious investor .
but certainly in terms of being part of a value chain , in providing some low and middle level management , labor , transport and so on , we would be certainly better equipped than chinese and americans .

massive amounts of oil are still gushing out and no one , neither bp nor the us government , can do anything about it .
are you astonished that the world 's superpower and one of the biggest oil company 's ca n't stop an oil leak ?
klaus toepfer : definitely .
i am to the utmost surprised .
it is not the only exploration in these depths , there are lots of others and if there is no possibility to stop such a leak then that gives us a totally new impression about the way we produce oil offshore ..
yes , it is more than astonishing that something is licensed when you can not handle a disaster like this .
president barack obama has been harshly criticised for his crisis management with charges that he has acted too late and not strongly enough .
how would you rate obama 's handling of the crisis ?
i think this was really an unexpected development .
that he is doing his utmost right now using not only strong words against bp , but also to integrate all the capacities of the superpower goes withhout saying .
so i would n't criticise him as harshly as he has been criticised by some commentators .
but this is a normal process in an open democratic system and you must be aware of those criticisms and you have to respond to it on a daily basis .
you have to have a clear understanding of the concerns of all the people living in the area most affected by the disaster .
you obviously have to focus on the ecological disaster , but this ecological disaster is linked with huge disaster for the people living in this region who earn their living with tourism , fishing and in other industries .
this serves as an important wake-up call that we now have to hurry up and change our options for producing electricity and energy so that we do n't need to depend any longer on these kinds of risky offshore endeavors .
bp has also been criticised very sharply over its handling and communication of the crisis .
what grade would you give them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toepfer i really believe they lost the control over how to handle the crisis and failed to live up to their responsibilty .
their performance was n't good at all and i am fairly sure that this will have consequences not only within bp , of course it has to start there , but for the industry as a whole .
we have to be aware that this is not only about bp , but there are comparable situations involving others as we saw with the exxon valdez and the disasters off the european coasts .
every crisis is of course an opportunity to learn and change something .
what consequences must be drawn from this crisis now ?
the first and most important consequence is : do your utmost to further develop new energy sources with lower risks .
because if we keep relying on fossil fuels , especially oil , we must recognize that the low-hanging fruits are already harvested and that we will maneuver ourselves into more and more risky and costly situations if we continue to rely on fossil fuels .
so it is high time that we further develop renewable energy and use sun and wind and biomass , geothermal and new energy sources like wave power .
we also have to realize now that the dream that oil is cheap is finally coming to an end .
of course it is easy to point one 's finger at the obama administration and bp for their handling of the crisis .
but are we sure that something like this could n't happen on our own front door in the north sea where there are also oil platforms and drilling ?
have germany and european countries done enough so that something like that ca n't happen there ?
the probability is definitely lower in the north sea .
there are different structures how to operate and handle those risks we saw in the gulf of mexico .
but nobody can be sure that there is zero risk in the north sea and other places in the world as well .
there is a risk , but the probability is much lower .
this oil disaster ranks already as the us ' worst environmental catastrophe in history .
as the un 's former point man on the environment : how bad is this on a global scale ?
this is a problem on a global scale without any doubt .
one should n't exaggerate it , but if you see all the images and pictures one can conclude that this is not just a limited problem in one region of the world , it is a clear signal for the whole world to come to a new assessment about those kinds of drillings and about oil production in general .
it would be a grave mistake to say do n't worry this is only a problem in the gulf of mexico .
klaus toepfer is the founding director of the institute for advanced sustainability studies in potsdam .
from 1998 to 2006 he was executive director of the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- .
prior to that he served as germany 's minister for the env ironment , nature conservation and nuclear safety between 1987 and 1994 .

massive amounts of oil are still gushing out and no one , neither bp nor the us government , can do anything about it .
are you astonished that the world 's superpower and one of the biggest oil company 's ca n't stop an oil leak ?
klaus toepfer : definitely .
i am to the utmost surprised .
it is not the only exploration in these depths , there are lots of others and if there is no possibility to stop such a leak then that gives us a totally new impression about the way we produce oil offshore ..
yes , it is more than astonishing that something is licensed when you can not handle a disaster like this .
president barack obama has been harshly criticised for his crisis management with charges that he has acted too late and not strongly enough .
how would you rate obama 's handling of the crisis ?
i think this was really an unexpected development .
that he is doing his utmost right now using not only strong words against bp , but also to integrate all the capacities of the superpower goes withhout saying .
so i would n't criticise him as harshly as he has been criticised by some commentators .
but this is a normal process in an open democratic system and you must be aware of those criticisms and you have to respond to it on a daily basis .
you have to have a clear understanding of the concerns of all the people living in the area most affected by the disaster .
you obviously have to focus on the ecological disaster , but this ecological disaster is linked with huge disaster for the people living in this region who earn their living with tourism , fishing and in other industries .
this serves as an important wake-up call that we now have to hurry up and change our options for producing electricity and energy so that we do n't need to depend any longer on these kinds of risky offshore endeavors .
bp has also been criticised very sharply over its handling and communication of the crisis .
what grade would you give them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toepfer i really believe they lost the control over how to handle the crisis and failed to live up to their responsibilty .
their performance was n't good at all and i am fairly sure that this will have consequences not only within bp , of course it has to start there , but for the industry as a whole .
we have to be aware that this is not only about bp , but there are comparable situations involving others as we saw with the exxon valdez and the disasters off the european coasts .
every crisis is of course an opportunity to learn and change something .
what consequences must be drawn from this crisis now ?
the first and most important consequence is : do your utmost to further develop new energy sources with lower risks .
because if we keep relying on fossil fuels , especially oil , we must recognize that the low-hanging fruits are already harvested and that we will maneuver ourselves into more and more risky and costly situations if we continue to rely on fossil fuels .
so it is high time that we further develop renewable energy and use sun and wind and biomass , geothermal and new energy sources like wave power .
we also have to realize now that the dream that oil is cheap is finally coming to an end .
of course it is easy to point one 's finger at the obama administration and bp for their handling of the crisis .
but are we sure that something like this could n't happen on our own front door in the north sea where there are also oil platforms and drilling ?
have germany and european countries done enough so that something like that ca n't happen there ?
the probability is definitely lower in the north sea .
there are different structures how to operate and handle those risks we saw in the gulf of mexico .
but nobody can be sure that there is zero risk in the north sea and other places in the world as well .
there is a risk , but the probability is much lower .
this oil disaster ranks already as the us ' worst environmental catastrophe in history .
as the un 's former point man on the environment : how bad is this on a global scale ?
this is a problem on a global scale without any doubt .

but dams and manmade reservoirs also encroach upon humans , wildlife and natural habitats .
a company based in south western germany that specializes in making high-performance pumps is currently testing a solution that can use the power of the river without affecting its ecosystem .
dieter-heinz hellmann , member of the ksb board of management , will present the operating principle of the new river turbine at this year ’ s deutsche welle global media forum in bonn , germany .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
ksb engineers turned a basic principle on its head .
bchanging the direction of flow , a pump can be used as a turbine and vice versa .
in other words , by introducing flow to a pump propeller in reverse , it begins rotating and turns the pump into a turbine .
the motor then behaves like a generator and the pump produces electricity .
a seven-meter-long river turbine prototype has been operating since march 2010 in a tributary of the rhine river near st. goar , where it produces hydroelectricity without any disruptive dam constructions .
only a few buoys bob on the surface , indicating the location of the turbine .
initial tests have shown that the ksb turbine neither interferes with the river ’ s ecosystem nor impedes the migratory routes of fish .
engineers at the ksb group think that their innovation could revolutionize the use of hydropower .
trial operation is scheduled to take an ambitious plunge this summer when a single river turbine will be used to convert the currents of the rhine into electricity to power ten households . more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .

but dams and manmade reservoirs also encroach upon humans , wildlife and natural habitats .
a company based in south western germany that specializes in making high-performance pumps is currently testing a solution that can use the power of the river without affecting its ecosystem .
dieter-heinz hellmann , member of the ksb board of management , will present the operating principle of the new river turbine at this year ’ s deutsche welle global media forum in bonn , germany .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
ksb engineers turned a basic principle on its head .
bchanging the direction of flow , a pump can be used as a turbine and vice versa .
in other words , by introducing flow to a pump propeller in reverse , it begins rotating and turns the pump into a turbine .
the motor then behaves like a generator and the pump produces electricity .
a seven-meter-long river turbine prototype has been operating since march 2010 in a tributary of the rhine river near st. goar , where it produces hydroelectricity without any disruptive dam constructions .
only a few buoys bob on the surface , indicating the location of the turbine .
initial tests have shown that the ksb turbine neither interferes with the river ’ s ecosystem nor impedes the migratory routes of fish .
engineers at the ksb group think that their innovation could revolutionize the use of hydropower .
trial operation is scheduled to take an ambitious plunge this summer when a single river turbine will be used to convert the currents of the rhine into electricity to power ten households . more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .

many thousands of refugees are fleeing the ethnic clashes , with the united nations warning of a possible humanitarian catastrophe . ethnic groups in kyrgyzstan clashed again in overnight battles as the official death toll in the country rose to at least 179 , according to a report by the kyrgyz news agency akipress , quoting the health ministry . the ministry said that it expected the actual number of dead to be much higher . troops were patrolling streets in the city of osh on wednesday morning , following clashes between kyrgyz groups and the uzbek minority .
the number of civilians forced to flee the violence is now put at 275,000 according to the united nations high commission for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- . united nations children 's fund unicef reports that women , children and the elderly make up more than 90 percent of the refugees .
the situation was growing increasingly serious , the head of the unhcr said on wednesday . " what is happening is already a tragedy and it could become a catastrophe . "
antonio guterres said during a visit to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic uzbeks have been gathering near the kyrgyz-uzbek border " we urgently need to find a political solution ... the country 's neighbors and the international community must do everything in their power to help the interim kyrgyz government restore peace and stability , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
officials in kyrgyzstan have warned that the ethnic conflict could spread to the country 's north and neighboring countries as aid agencies attempt to cope with the humanitarian crisis in the central asian country .
some 2,000 people have been wounded in the fighting which erupted last thursday , according to official figures .
violence in the southern cities of osh and jalalabad has raised fears over the future stability of the country of 5.3 million , where uzbeks make up 14 percent of the population .
aid groups working overtime uzbekistan has been struggling to deal with a flood of ethnic refugees who crossed the border to escape the unrest .
with around 75,000 refugees already inside uzbekistan after fleeing the southern cities , authorities said they had closed off the border to prevent that number from swelling .
however the office of the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , which has been working to get relief supplies into the central asian countries , told deutsche welle it understood the border has now been reopened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations high commissioner for refugees , antonio guterres , warned of catastrophe " we have this understanding that the border is open .
we understand that yesterday it was closed temporarily for the night and now it is open , " says unhcr spokesperson babar baloch .
" the un high commissioner here in geneva , antonio guterres , has welcomed the uzbek authorities ' decision to open the border and welcome refugees who are seeking asylum in uzbekistan . "
baloch says that the unhcr plans to send six relief planes in total with 240 metric tons of supplies to uzbekistan in the coming days .
he said this would be followed by more aid once the unhcr had established a presence on the ground .
baloch added that the unhcr had been experiencing problems in reaching displaced peoples in areas around osh because of the security situation .
" we had hoped to be able to reach those people .
we have some stocks on the ground at the unhcr warehouse there in osh and we already have been in touch with the icrc -lrb- international committee of the red cross -rrb- to distribute the items we have there , but we understand and we are concerned at the poor security situation in osh and jalalabad and other areas which is impeding aid delivery .

she said the clashes were beginning to wane and that she hoped that her country 's own forces could get the situation under control .
moscow says it considers the violence in southern kyrgyzstan an internal matter for that country and has only sent several hundred troops to defend a russian military base in kyrgyzstan .
both russia and the united states have military installations in the central asian country , with the us using the strategic position as a hub to support its forces in afghanistan .
otunbayeva also said a planned constitutional referendum would go ahead on june 27 .
she was speaking at a press conference after the eu had warned that the violent clashes threatened to derail the country 's reform process .
however this view is not shared by icrc head of operations for central asia and eastern europe , pascale meige wagner , who warned " we 're far from seeing the end of this crisis . "
" we hear extremely worrying stories about people targeted - there is a will to harm and kill in kyrgzystan . "

that is the main finding of a new report presented by the german education ministry . more evidence of the desperate state of germany 's education system was revealed on wednesday , with the pre-publication of statistics from a new " education in germany " report .
according to the report , which is to be presented thursday by the german education ministry and the state conference on education , an assembly of germany 's state education ministers , 17 percent of young germans aged between 20 and 30 have no vocational qualification and are no longer in the education system .
this marks a new high - in 2007 , the figure was still at 15.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezdemir is convinced the problems are endemic the situation is particularly dire among young people with an immigrant background , 30 percent of whom have no formal training and no prospect of achieving further qualifications .
in the face of increasing pressures in the job market , the researchers warned that germany could be facing a long-term unemployment problem for those without formal qualifications .
one forecast predicts that the supply of unqualified workers would exceed the number of jobs in this sector by some 1.3 million for the next 15 years .
for cem oezdemir , education spokesman for the green party , the deficits in germany 's system are appalling .
" we 're talking about a sort of risk-group that leaves school lacking basic reading , writing and arithmetic skills - they are functionally illiterate , " he told deutsche welle .
no surprises problems have been endemic for years , and the report 's findings provide few surprises for those concerned with german education .
stephanie odenwald , director for vocational training at the educational workers ' union gew , said , " it 's not a surprise - everyone who knows the education system has known this problem for years . "
odenwald can also identify one of the main causes of the problem : " it is mainly the fault of the misguided development of this massive transitional system , where young people leave school and do n't get into job training programs and instead get put into these waiting loops , or ' job preparation schemes ' as they are known .

" what this study makes clear is that we need to question our whole education system - from kindergarten all the way to university , " he said .
" the interim system is just one element of it . "
the sacred cow gymnasium the new report is one of many that have indirectly brought attention to the injustices in germany 's three-tiered school system , which divides students according to ability into one of three different schools after the fourth grade - these are the hauptschule , the realschule and the elite gymnasium .
international comparisons like the pisa studies have highlighted the social inequalities that are caused by this system .
the report shows that hauptschule students continue to have problems finding job training places , even though the competition for them is said to be decreasing .
as far as oezdemir is concerned , germany 's conservative government resists reform because it is clinging to the gymnasium .
" there really is n't a recognition problem , " he says .
" these studies always come out with similar results .
there is an application problem .
we know the problems , but the politicians get bogged down in financial questions , and the taboo of the gymnasium .

that is the main finding of a new report presented by the german education ministry . more evidence of the desperate state of germany 's education system was revealed on wednesday , with the pre-publication of statistics from a new " education in germany " report .
according to the report , which is to be presented thursday by the german education ministry and the state conference on education , an assembly of germany 's state education ministers , 17 percent of young germans aged between 20 and 30 have no vocational qualification and are no longer in the education system .
this marks a new high - in 2007 , the figure was still at 15.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezdemir is convinced the problems are endemic the situation is particularly dire among young people with an immigrant background , 30 percent of whom have no formal training and no prospect of achieving further qualifications .
in the face of increasing pressures in the job market , the researchers warned that germany could be facing a long-term unemployment problem for those without formal qualifications .
one forecast predicts that the supply of unqualified workers would exceed the number of jobs in this sector by some 1.3 million for the next 15 years .
for cem oezdemir , education spokesman for the green party , the deficits in germany 's system are appalling .
" we 're talking about a sort of risk-group that leaves school lacking basic reading , writing and arithmetic skills - they are functionally illiterate , " he told deutsche welle .
no surprises problems have been endemic for years , and the report 's findings provide few surprises for those concerned with german education .
stephanie odenwald , director for vocational training at the educational workers ' union gew , said , " it 's not a surprise - everyone who knows the education system has known this problem for years . "
odenwald can also identify one of the main causes of the problem : " it is mainly the fault of the misguided development of this massive transitional system , where young people leave school and do n't get into job training programs and instead get put into these waiting loops , or ' job preparation schemes ' as they are known .

but the band do have one thing in common with the world ’ s most famous book : a knowledge that big things are going to happen . abel & cain 's lead singer chris blöcher is sure that pretty soon there 'll come a time when stadium crowds are singing along to their songs .
" basically we ’ re ready for our time , our d-day in the music scene if you like , " he said , " that ’ s the only thing we want to do and we 're giving it our all to make sure it happens . "
quite ambitious , one might think , to compare their musical breakthrough with the normandy landings , but these aren ’ t empty words .
marek and chris have already enjoyed a taste of success with their previous band atemlos .
they scored three sizable chart hits , shot a bunch of music videos and were even featured on german music tv channel viva .
but despite their burgeoning popularity , they decided the direction the band was heading in just was n't them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : front man chris on stage a knack for pathos they let the atemlos project fold and switched to singing in english with the formation of abel & cain .
they 're not shy about citing big guns like oasis and coldplay as influences ; their music is rock with an emotional slant … and not necessarily always with positive origins .
" all these emotional songs and melodies actually originate from certain feelings of rage , " explains chris , " not necessarily against things which you have done wrong yourself but things that are or were frustrating and which play off each other .
we see ourselves as headed in a direction which will allow us to say we can be free to do what we want . "
their journey to fame and fortune has seen them successfully complete a stint at popcamp , an intense band coaching boot camp organized by the german music council , and put the finishing touches to the recordings for their debut album .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popcamp is a high-level band coaching project sponsored by the german music council all set for the international market chris is actually dreaming of a future where he isn ’ t chained to germany : " i 'd like to be somewhere where no one knows who i am , where i do n't know anyone , where i 'd never know what might happen when i walk around the corner .

in order to accomplish that , he 's ditched the idea of singing in german with the view that english songs fare better internationally than german ones .

the five year plan abel & cain are n't dreaming of success ; as far as the four guys from düsseldorf are concerned , they 're already convinced it 's going to happen and that this is the right time .
at the moment , they 're all working flat out towards this goal so much so that chris knows exactly where he sees the band in five years ' time .
" i want to see the music we make mature and to see it develop into something round and perfect , " he adds , " i can picture way more live shows , touring our third album . i can really see us doing well in this business .

many thousands of refugees are fleeing the ethnic clashes , with the united nations warning of a possible humanitarian catastrophe . ethnic groups in kyrgyzstan clashed again in overnight battles as the official death toll in the country rose to at least 179 , according to a report by the kyrgyz news agency akipress , quoting the health ministry . the ministry said that it expected the actual number of dead to be much higher . troops were patrolling streets in the city of osh on wednesday morning , following clashes between kyrgyz groups and the uzbek minority .
the number of civilians forced to flee the violence is now put at 275,000 according to the united nations high commission for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- . united nations children 's fund unicef reports that women , children and the elderly make up more than 90 percent of the refugees .
the situation was growing increasingly serious , the head of the unhcr said on wednesday . " what is happening is already a tragedy and it could become a catastrophe . "
antonio guterres said during a visit to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic uzbeks have been gathering near the kyrgyz-uzbek border " we urgently need to find a political solution ... the country 's neighbors and the international community must do everything in their power to help the interim kyrgyz government restore peace and stability , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
officials in kyrgyzstan have warned that the ethnic conflict could spread to the country 's north and neighboring countries as aid agencies attempt to cope with the humanitarian crisis in the central asian country .
some 2,000 people have been wounded in the fighting which erupted last thursday , according to official figures .
violence in the southern cities of osh and jalalabad has raised fears over the future stability of the country of 5.3 million , where uzbeks make up 14 percent of the population .
aid groups working overtime uzbekistan has been struggling to deal with a flood of ethnic refugees who crossed the border to escape the unrest .
with around 75,000 refugees already inside uzbekistan after fleeing the southern cities , authorities said they had closed off the border to prevent that number from swelling .
however the office of the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , which has been working to get relief supplies into the central asian countries , told deutsche welle it understood the border has now been reopened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations high commissioner for refugees , antonio guterres , warned of catastrophe " we have this understanding that the border is open .
we understand that yesterday it was closed temporarily for the night and now it is open , " says unhcr spokesperson babar baloch .
" the un high commissioner here in geneva , antonio guterres , has welcomed the uzbek authorities ' decision to open the border and welcome refugees who are seeking asylum in uzbekistan . "
baloch says that the unhcr plans to send six relief planes in total with 240 metric tons of supplies to uzbekistan in the coming days .
he said this would be followed by more aid once the unhcr had established a presence on the ground .
baloch added that the unhcr had been experiencing problems in reaching displaced peoples in areas around osh because of the security situation .
" we had hoped to be able to reach those people .
we have some stocks on the ground at the unhcr warehouse there in osh and we already have been in touch with the icrc -lrb- international committee of the red cross -rrb- to distribute the items we have there , but we understand and we are concerned at the poor security situation in osh and jalalabad and other areas which is impeding aid delivery .

many thousands of refugees are fleeing the ethnic clashes , with the united nations warning of a possible humanitarian catastrophe . ethnic groups in kyrgyzstan clashed again in overnight battles as the official death toll in the country rose to at least 179 , according to a report by the kyrgyz news agency akipress , quoting the health ministry . the ministry said that it expected the actual number of dead to be much higher . troops were patrolling streets in the city of osh on wednesday morning , following clashes between kyrgyz groups and the uzbek minority .
the number of civilians forced to flee the violence is now put at 275,000 according to the united nations high commission for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- . united nations children 's fund unicef reports that women , children and the elderly make up more than 90 percent of the refugees .

officials in kyrgyzstan have warned that the ethnic conflict could spread to the country 's north and neighboring countries as aid agencies attempt to cope with the humanitarian crisis in the central asian country .

" the un high commissioner here in geneva , antonio guterres , has welcomed the uzbek authorities ' decision to open the border and welcome refugees who are seeking asylum in uzbekistan . "
baloch says that the unhcr plans to send six relief planes in total with 240 metric tons of supplies to uzbekistan in the coming days .
he said this would be followed by more aid once the unhcr had established a presence on the ground .
baloch added that the unhcr had been experiencing problems in reaching displaced peoples in areas around osh because of the security situation .
" we had hoped to be able to reach those people .
we have some stocks on the ground at the unhcr warehouse there in osh and we already have been in touch with the icrc -lrb- international committee of the red cross -rrb- to distribute the items we have there , but we understand and we are concerned at the poor security situation in osh and jalalabad and other areas which is impeding aid delivery .

now , according to india 's official press information bureau , afghanistan has invited india to invest in its mining sector , particularly in mining iron ore , copper , gold and coal . during a visit to india on tuesday , afghanistan 's mines minister wahidullah shahrani also sought india 's know-how in the field of mineral exploration .
he also said that afghanistan will launch a road show in london on june 25 , in which about 200 companies from across the globe will be invited to showcase their mining and exploration potential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's mines minister wahidullah shahrani india needs minerals and metals experts say resource-hungry india is not likely to forgo any opportunity to extract afghanistan 's untapped valuable mineral deposits , which also include lithium , a key material used in a wide range of consumer products . " india is an expanding economy and our requirements for different types of minerals will go up , " says santosh kumar , a former indian diplomat in new delhi .
" india is among the leading technological countries in the world .
and in those technologies like for example aerospace and so on , there are new metals and new applications for these metals required .
since we do n't have these metals and rare earths in india , some of them we import , so obviously any discoveries in our neighborhood would be of interest to us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign secretary nirupama rao visits the indian embassy in kabul following a suicide attack in 2009 security is a challenge but expert kumar also points out that indian companies working in the field have some serious concerns : " for them , there are two problems .
one is the security situation .
the second is that these minerals are found in parts which are not well connected .
so transport is a critical issue . " following the attacks that killed seven indians in kabul earlier this year , new delhi has often expressed worries over the security of its nationals in afghanistan . many observers in the us also believe that security problems , weak infrastructure and corruption will be a hindrance for digging up the mineral riches .
there are also concerns that the taliban could intensify their campaign now that they know that afghanistan is sitting on a goldmine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chinese delegation visiting the site of a copper mine in aynak in 2007 china and pakistan but given the scale of afghanistan 's mineral wealth , many may not hesitate to take a risk .

that is the main finding of a new report presented by the german education ministry . more evidence of the desperate state of germany 's education system was revealed on wednesday , with the pre-publication of statistics from a new " education in germany " report .
according to the report , which is to be presented thursday by the german education ministry and the state conference on education , an assembly of germany 's state education ministers , 17 percent of young germans aged between 20 and 30 have no vocational qualification and are no longer in the education system .
this marks a new high - in 2007 , the figure was still at 15.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezdemir is convinced the problems are endemic the situation is particularly dire among young people with an immigrant background , 30 percent of whom have no formal training and no prospect of achieving further qualifications .
in the face of increasing pressures in the job market , the researchers warned that germany could be facing a long-term unemployment problem for those without formal qualifications .
one forecast predicts that the supply of unqualified workers would exceed the number of jobs in this sector by some 1.3 million for the next 15 years .
for cem oezdemir , education spokesman for the green party , the deficits in germany 's system are appalling .
" we 're talking about a sort of risk-group that leaves school lacking basic reading , writing and arithmetic skills - they are functionally illiterate , " he told deutsche welle .
no surprises problems have been endemic for years , and the report 's findings provide few surprises for those concerned with german education .
stephanie odenwald , director for vocational training at the educational workers ' union gew , said , " it 's not a surprise - everyone who knows the education system has known this problem for years . "
odenwald can also identify one of the main causes of the problem : " it is mainly the fault of the misguided development of this massive transitional system , where young people leave school and do n't get into job training programs and instead get put into these waiting loops , or ' job preparation schemes ' as they are known .
there is a very wide body of opinion that says we need to get rid of this system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with an immigrant background are particularly disadvantaged this transitional system has often been blamed for leaving many of germany 's young people in limbo after leaving school , but oezdemir says that the problems are much deeper .
" what this study makes clear is that we need to question our whole education system - from kindergarten all the way to university , " he said .
" the interim system is just one element of it . "
the sacred cow gymnasium the new report is one of many that have indirectly brought attention to the injustices in germany 's three-tiered school system , which divides students according to ability into one of three different schools after the fourth grade - these are the hauptschule , the realschule and the elite gymnasium .
international comparisons like the pisa studies have highlighted the social inequalities that are caused by this system .
the report shows that hauptschule students continue to have problems finding job training places , even though the competition for them is said to be decreasing .
as far as oezdemir is concerned , germany 's conservative government resists reform because it is clinging to the gymnasium .
" there really is n't a recognition problem , " he says .
" these studies always come out with similar results .
there is an application problem .
we know the problems , but the politicians get bogged down in financial questions , and the taboo of the gymnasium .
the schools need to fit our children , not the other way round . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezdemir is convinced the problems are endemic the situation is particularly dire among young people with an immigrant background , 30 percent of whom have no formal training and no prospect of achieving further qualifications .
in the face of increasing pressures in the job market , the researchers warned that germany could be facing a long-term unemployment problem for those without formal qualifications .
one forecast predicts that the supply of unqualified workers would exceed the number of jobs in this sector by some 1.3 million for the next 15 years .
for cem oezdemir , education spokesman for the green party , the deficits in germany 's system are appalling .
" we 're talking about a sort of risk-group that leaves school lacking basic reading , writing and arithmetic skills - they are functionally illiterate , " he told deutsche welle .
no surprises problems have been endemic for years , and the report 's findings provide few surprises for those concerned with german education .
stephanie odenwald , director for vocational training at the educational workers ' union gew , said , " it 's not a surprise - everyone who knows the education system has known this problem for years . "
odenwald can also identify one of the main causes of the problem : " it is mainly the fault of the misguided development of this massive transitional system , where young people leave school and do n't get into job training programs and instead get put into these waiting loops , or ' job preparation schemes ' as they are known .
there is a very wide body of opinion that says we need to get rid of this system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with an immigrant background are particularly disadvantaged this transitional system has often been blamed for leaving many of germany 's young people in limbo after leaving school , but oezdemir says that the problems are much deeper .
" what this study makes clear is that we need to question our whole education system - from kindergarten all the way to university , " he said .
" the interim system is just one element of it . "
the sacred cow gymnasium the new report is one of many that have indirectly brought attention to the injustices in germany 's three-tiered school system , which divides students according to ability into one of three different schools after the fourth grade - these are the hauptschule , the realschule and the elite gymnasium .
international comparisons like the pisa studies have highlighted the social inequalities that are caused by this system .
the report shows that hauptschule students continue to have problems finding job training places , even though the competition for them is said to be decreasing .
as far as oezdemir is concerned , germany 's conservative government resists reform because it is clinging to the gymnasium .
" there really is n't a recognition problem , " he says .
" these studies always come out with similar results .
there is an application problem .
we know the problems , but the politicians get bogged down in financial questions , and the taboo of the gymnasium .
the schools need to fit our children , not the other way round . "

mineral resources worth about a trillion dollars have been found in afghanistan .
these include gold , iron , cobalt and lithium . the report about the pentagon 's huge afghan mineral finds and their economic potential has attracted a lot of attention in afghanistan .
many are upbeat about it .
abdurrahman ashraf , the advisor to president hamid karzai on mining issues , says that his government will conduct an in-depth investigation to verify the information .
" we have been given data which are necessary for the mining of the resources .
we will work with that , " he says .
" we will take samples on the ground and find out the mineral content of various deposits .
then we can say which deposits are economically worthwhile and which are not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president karzai 's government is conducting an investigation into the mineral deposits the information is not ' new ' the us government 's supposedly new information about the mineral riches is in fact not that new .
during the occupation of afghanistan in the 1980s , soviet geologists had already explored the soil and collected data .
after the withdrawal of the red army , afghan geologists hid the maps which their soviet colleagues had left behind .
the information remained under wraps until the western forces drove the taliban out of kabul in 2001 . the white house in washington seemed to have not known about the mineral resources until recently , when an internal memo by the us department of defense said the value of the deposits in afghanistan was about a trillion dollars .
sayfuddin sayhoon , an afghan economist believes that the us experts underestimate the wealth of his country : " the numbers given by the americans are understated .
some other sources even speak of a value of up to six trillion dollars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear that the taliban could intensify their insurgency after the recent revelations timing of the report experts in kabul wonder why washington has made this information public now .
some believe that the white house is trying to show us citizens that their soldiers are not fighting in vain , and that a lot of money is involved here .
economist sayhoon believes there could be other motives as well : " the us is warning us afghans and suggesting to us to consider exploiting and using these mineral resources .
moreover , the news is meant to attract the attention of western companies .
it seems that some western firms have already been contemplating about engaging in mining in afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several mineral deposits are hidden in the hindu kush mountains expertise needed maybe this is why karzai 's advisor abdurrahman ashraf is trying to play down the expectations .
" the mining and sale of these mineral resources require special expertise , which we do not have right now , " he says .
" moreover , our generation has not the right to sell everything . "
ashraf also suggests that afghans might prefer to sell the valuable mineral resources to china or india rather than to western buyers . experts however see such a statement as an attempt by the kabul government to use afghanistan 's mineral resources as an asset and to pit the west , china and india against each other - while keeping all options open . authors : arif farahmand , cem sey / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mineral resources worth about a trillion dollars have been found in afghanistan .
these include gold , iron , cobalt and lithium . the report about the pentagon 's huge afghan mineral finds and their economic potential has attracted a lot of attention in afghanistan .
many are upbeat about it .
abdurrahman ashraf , the advisor to president hamid karzai on mining issues , says that his government will conduct an in-depth investigation to verify the information .
" we have been given data which are necessary for the mining of the resources .
we will work with that , " he says .
" we will take samples on the ground and find out the mineral content of various deposits .
then we can say which deposits are economically worthwhile and which are not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president karzai 's government is conducting an investigation into the mineral deposits the information is not ' new ' the us government 's supposedly new information about the mineral riches is in fact not that new .
during the occupation of afghanistan in the 1980s , soviet geologists had already explored the soil and collected data .
after the withdrawal of the red army , afghan geologists hid the maps which their soviet colleagues had left behind .
the information remained under wraps until the western forces drove the taliban out of kabul in 2001 . the white house in washington seemed to have not known about the mineral resources until recently , when an internal memo by the us department of defense said the value of the deposits in afghanistan was about a trillion dollars .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear that the taliban could intensify their insurgency after the recent revelations timing of the report experts in kabul wonder why washington has made this information public now .
some believe that the white house is trying to show us citizens that their soldiers are not fighting in vain , and that a lot of money is involved here .
economist sayhoon believes there could be other motives as well : " the us is warning us afghans and suggesting to us to consider exploiting and using these mineral resources .
moreover , the news is meant to attract the attention of western companies .
it seems that some western firms have already been contemplating about engaging in mining in afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several mineral deposits are hidden in the hindu kush mountains expertise needed maybe this is why karzai 's advisor abdurrahman ashraf is trying to play down the expectations .
" the mining and sale of these mineral resources require special expertise , which we do not have right now , " he says .
" moreover , our generation has not the right to sell everything . "
ashraf also suggests that afghans might prefer to sell the valuable mineral resources to china or india rather than to western buyers . experts however see such a statement as an attempt by the kabul government to use afghanistan 's mineral resources as an asset and to pit the west , china and india against each other - while keeping all options open . authors : arif farahmand , cem sey / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier , in group h , switzerland shocked spain 1-0 , while chile overcame honduras by the same score line . uruguay have beaten south africa 3-0 in the second round of group a games at the world cup , pushing the south americans up to four points and leaving bafana bafana languishing on one point .
south africa started the game with energy and tight passing , taking it to the uruguayan defense .
however the dominant possession did n't pay dividends for the hosts , when uruguay scored in the 23rd minute through a looping shot from outside the box by atletico madrid striker diego forlan .
the ball tucked under the crossbar and into the back of the net , leaving south african keeper itumeleng khune helpless .
the goal did n't have a huge impact on south africa 's composure , but from that point onwards the possession balanced out and uruguay was allowed more time in their attacking third .
uruguay started the second half a different team , keeping the south african defense under pressure for the opening 15 minutes .
south africa seemed somewhat lackluster with the ball and were unable to threaten their opponent 's goal until the 65th minute after a cross from the right by siboniso gaxa to the near post met katlego mphela 's head , though the forward pushed the ball wide .
the death knell for south africa came in the 76th minute when khune was red carded for bringing down ajax striker luis suarez in the box after he was clear on goal .
forlan coolly smashed home the resultant penalty kick .
uruguay made it 3-0 with a close-range header from alvaro pereira deep in injury time from a suarez cross .
south africa must now hope for a win next tuesday against france if they are to have any hope of progressing to the round of 16 .
shock in nelspruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland upset spain , who were title favorites in wednesday 's afternoon match , european title holders spain were toppled in their first world cup match after going down 1-0 in a shock loss to ottmar hitzfeld ’ s switzerland .
the swiss took the lead in the 52nd minute through a scrappy goal against the run of play from gelson fernandes , who picked up a loose ball after spanish keeper iker casillas collided with eren derdiyok in the box .
xavi alonso went closest to equalizing for the spaniards in the 70th minute when his shot from the edge of the box rebounded off the crossbar .
switzerland nearly went 2-0 up four minutes later when derdiyok weaved past two men in the box and struck the right post after a deft shot with the outside of his right boot .
the victory is the first for switzerland over spain in 19 meetings and represents by far the greatest upset so far in the world cup in south africa .
spain dominated possession in the first 45 minutes , getting most of their team behind the ball .
the best chance fell to gerard pique , who cut back inside swiss defender stephane grichting but saw his shot rebound off the legs of keeper diego benaglio .
despite showing sparks of brilliance with the ball , spain rarely threatened during the half , while switzerland , too , lacked any real scoring opportunities .
vicente del bosque 's spain , which , going into the tournament , was among the teams most favored to lift the world cup , were expected to come away with all three points against switzerland .
victory after 48 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beausejour -lrb- in red -rrb- shoots to score past honduras goalkeeper noel valladares in the day 's opening group h match , chile ended a 48-year winless streak in the world cup by overcoming honduras 1-0 at mbombela stadium in nelspruit .
striker jean beausejour bagged the only goal of the game .
in a game which it dominated , chile were unlucky not to extend their lead after man-of-the-match beausejour 's 34th minute strike .
the goal followed some slick passing in the honduran box which created space for mauricio isla on the right flank to get a low cross in at the near post , which was turned in by the mexico-based beausejour .
chile defender waldo ponce came forward for a free kick midway through the second half and should have doubled the lead only for veteran goalie noel valladares to parry away a diving point-blank header .
midfielder jorge valdivia had another chance at the goal 15 minutes from full-time , but was correctly flagged offside as the " killer " second goal continued to elude chile .

earlier , in group h , switzerland shocked spain 1-0 , while chile overcame honduras by the same score line . uruguay have beaten south africa 3-0 in the second round of group a games at the world cup , pushing the south americans up to four points and leaving bafana bafana languishing on one point .
south africa started the game with energy and tight passing , taking it to the uruguayan defense .
however the dominant possession did n't pay dividends for the hosts , when uruguay scored in the 23rd minute through a looping shot from outside the box by atletico madrid striker diego forlan .
the ball tucked under the crossbar and into the back of the net , leaving south african keeper itumeleng khune helpless .
the goal did n't have a huge impact on south africa 's composure , but from that point onwards the possession balanced out and uruguay was allowed more time in their attacking third .
uruguay started the second half a different team , keeping the south african defense under pressure for the opening 15 minutes .
south africa seemed somewhat lackluster with the ball and were unable to threaten their opponent 's goal until the 65th minute after a cross from the right by siboniso gaxa to the near post met katlego mphela 's head , though the forward pushed the ball wide .
the death knell for south africa came in the 76th minute when khune was red carded for bringing down ajax striker luis suarez in the box after he was clear on goal .
forlan coolly smashed home the resultant penalty kick .
uruguay made it 3-0 with a close-range header from alvaro pereira deep in injury time from a suarez cross .
south africa must now hope for a win next tuesday against france if they are to have any hope of progressing to the round of 16 .
shock in nelspruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland upset spain , who were title favorites in wednesday 's afternoon match , european title holders spain were toppled in their first world cup match after going down 1-0 in a shock loss to ottmar hitzfeld ’ s switzerland .
the swiss took the lead in the 52nd minute through a scrappy goal against the run of play from gelson fernandes , who picked up a loose ball after spanish keeper iker casillas collided with eren derdiyok in the box .
xavi alonso went closest to equalizing for the spaniards in the 70th minute when his shot from the edge of the box rebounded off the crossbar .
switzerland nearly went 2-0 up four minutes later when derdiyok weaved past two men in the box and struck the right post after a deft shot with the outside of his right boot .
the victory is the first for switzerland over spain in 19 meetings and represents by far the greatest upset so far in the world cup in south africa .
spain dominated possession in the first 45 minutes , getting most of their team behind the ball .
the best chance fell to gerard pique , who cut back inside swiss defender stephane grichting but saw his shot rebound off the legs of keeper diego benaglio .
despite showing sparks of brilliance with the ball , spain rarely threatened during the half , while switzerland , too , lacked any real scoring opportunities .
vicente del bosque 's spain , which , going into the tournament , was among the teams most favored to lift the world cup , were expected to come away with all three points against switzerland .
victory after 48 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beausejour -lrb- in red -rrb- shoots to score past honduras goalkeeper noel valladares in the day 's opening group h match , chile ended a 48-year winless streak in the world cup by overcoming honduras 1-0 at mbombela stadium in nelspruit .
striker jean beausejour bagged the only goal of the game .
in a game which it dominated , chile were unlucky not to extend their lead after man-of-the-match beausejour 's 34th minute strike .
the goal followed some slick passing in the honduran box which created space for mauricio isla on the right flank to get a low cross in at the near post , which was turned in by the mexico-based beausejour .
chile defender waldo ponce came forward for a free kick midway through the second half and should have doubled the lead only for veteran goalie noel valladares to parry away a diving point-blank header .
midfielder jorge valdivia had another chance at the goal 15 minutes from full-time , but was correctly flagged offside as the " killer " second goal continued to elude chile .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 16.06.2010 installation artist christo says freedom is the enemy of possession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and wife jeanne-claude worked together for decades christo 's installations are often larger than life : a huge sheet covering the german parliament or islands surrounded by floating fabric .
the artist talked with deutsche welle about some of the big ideas behind them . contemporary installation artist christo turns 75 this week , less than a year after the loss of his wife and artistic partner jeanne-claude .
deutsche welle spoke with christo about how he is moving forward with his work and what he thinks about its reception .
two museums in germany - the kunsthalle wuerth and the max ernst museum in bruehl - are currently displaying some of his works .
deutsche welle : you had such a symbiotic relationship with jeanne-claude .
how is it for you to continue work now on the projects you had planned together ?
christo : we always knew that one of us would be the first to go , and we 've known that for almost the last 50 years .
ever since we met in 1958 , we 've always traveled in separate planes so that one of us would be able to finish the work we started .
so , everything was in some way already prepared .
these projects take so long to get permission and to realize that we always envisioned this was possible .
many people struggle to understand the concept that you do n't work for money .
what does it say about our society that people have so much trouble grasping that you do art simply to create new art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wrapped reichstag " -lrb- 1995 -rrb- was realized 24 years after its conception this relates to the way i was brought up and educated in bulgaria under communism .
basically , the projects deal in large part with freedom .
of course , i do make money by selling the preparatory drawings and studies for the projects .
on paper , i put down my visions , jeanne-claude 's visions , our visions .
i also produce a variety of tangible goods to create the funds necessary to build projects that can not be bought and can not be owned - even jeanne-claude and i do n't own them .
the projects are about freedom .
freedom is the enemy of possession , and possession is equal to permanence .
you know , humans like to be in the presence of things that are unique like they are - things that wo n't happen again .
the projects have a quality of fragility and tenderness , like our own lives or our own childhood .
they can not be substituted or repeated .
but how much of a problem do you think our society has in understanding what you 're trying to do with your work ?
i would never think about that myself .
we like to build these projects because we enjoy it for ourselves , like any true artist .
any artist - an abstract painter , a watercolorist , whoever - enjoys and lives to do the work .
the projects begin from an almost visceral desire to realize something because you think it 's beautiful .
if somebody likes the work , it 's almost like a bonus - an additional dimension .
these projects deal with a very wide variety of aesthetic dimensions .
a 3-d work of art is different from a painting with a flat surface .
with a sculpture , you can move around it , you perceive the volume and dimensions .
but all of that space is entirely designed by the artist , who exercises an absurd amount of control over the space .
now , there 's another space we think very little about .
the moment you walk out of your home , somebody else designed the sidewalk , the roads and the lights .
basically 24 hours a day , we 're in a highly planned space that we do n't even think about .
in our work , we more or less borrow that space and create a gentle disturbance for a few days .
by doing so , we inherit everything inherent to that space , and it becomes a part of the work of art .
you just turned 75 .
that 's significant in many ways , is n't it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the gates " -lrb- 2005 -rrb- in new york city cost $ 21 million , raised entirely by the artists at least i 'm still alive -lrb- laughs -rrb- - but i really do n't think about that .
i 've lived in the same building for 46 years .
i climb 90 steps about 15 times a day - i do n't have an elevator .
do you perhaps want to do something permanent at this stage in your life ?
i do a lot of things that are permanent - a lot of drawings , sketches , collages , and sculptures .
they 're permanent and in museums .
i 'm not against the idea of things existing permanently .
for instance , each time a big project is finished and removed , it has its own documentation exhibition that tells the story of the project .
there are scale models , cables , fabric , and samples .
these exhibitions do not substitute for the projects .
they 're about the projects .
but through them , you should see connections to all the works - they 're connected , they 're not separate .
the reality of these large projects is that there are so many different levels of perception involved .
i think this is the body of our work together - it can not be separate .

the artist talked with deutsche welle about some of the big ideas behind them . contemporary installation artist christo turns 75 this week , less than a year after the loss of his wife and artistic partner jeanne-claude .
deutsche welle spoke with christo about how he is moving forward with his work and what he thinks about its reception .
two museums in germany - the kunsthalle wuerth and the max ernst museum in bruehl - are currently displaying some of his works .
deutsche welle : you had such a symbiotic relationship with jeanne-claude .
how is it for you to continue work now on the projects you had planned together ?
christo : we always knew that one of us would be the first to go , and we 've known that for almost the last 50 years .
ever since we met in 1958 , we 've always traveled in separate planes so that one of us would be able to finish the work we started .
so , everything was in some way already prepared .
these projects take so long to get permission and to realize that we always envisioned this was possible .
many people struggle to understand the concept that you do n't work for money .
what does it say about our society that people have so much trouble grasping that you do art simply to create new art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wrapped reichstag " -lrb- 1995 -rrb- was realized 24 years after its conception this relates to the way i was brought up and educated in bulgaria under communism .
basically , the projects deal in large part with freedom .
of course , i do make money by selling the preparatory drawings and studies for the projects .
on paper , i put down my visions , jeanne-claude 's visions , our visions .
i also produce a variety of tangible goods to create the funds necessary to build projects that can not be bought and can not be owned - even jeanne-claude and i do n't own them .
the projects are about freedom .
freedom is the enemy of possession , and possession is equal to permanence .
you know , humans like to be in the presence of things that are unique like they are - things that wo n't happen again .
the projects have a quality of fragility and tenderness , like our own lives or our own childhood .
they can not be substituted or repeated .
but how much of a problem do you think our society has in understanding what you 're trying to do with your work ?
i would never think about that myself .
we like to build these projects because we enjoy it for ourselves , like any true artist .
any artist - an abstract painter , a watercolorist , whoever - enjoys and lives to do the work .
the projects begin from an almost visceral desire to realize something because you think it 's beautiful .
if somebody likes the work , it 's almost like a bonus - an additional dimension .
these projects deal with a very wide variety of aesthetic dimensions .
a 3-d work of art is different from a painting with a flat surface .
with a sculpture , you can move around it , you perceive the volume and dimensions .
but all of that space is entirely designed by the artist , who exercises an absurd amount of control over the space .
now , there 's another space we think very little about .
the moment you walk out of your home , somebody else designed the sidewalk , the roads and the lights .
basically 24 hours a day , we 're in a highly planned space that we do n't even think about .
in our work , we more or less borrow that space and create a gentle disturbance for a few days .
by doing so , we inherit everything inherent to that space , and it becomes a part of the work of art .
you just turned 75 .
that 's significant in many ways , is n't it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the gates " -lrb- 2005 -rrb- in new york city cost $ 21 million , raised entirely by the artists at least i 'm still alive -lrb- laughs -rrb- - but i really do n't think about that .
i 've lived in the same building for 46 years .
i climb 90 steps about 15 times a day - i do n't have an elevator .
do you perhaps want to do something permanent at this stage in your life ?
i do a lot of things that are permanent - a lot of drawings , sketches , collages , and sculptures .
they 're permanent and in museums .
i 'm not against the idea of things existing permanently .
for instance , each time a big project is finished and removed , it has its own documentation exhibition that tells the story of the project .
there are scale models , cables , fabric , and samples .
these exhibitions do not substitute for the projects .
they 're about the projects .
but through them , you should see connections to all the works - they 're connected , they 're not separate .
the reality of these large projects is that there are so many different levels of perception involved .
i think this is the body of our work together - it can not be separate .

the artist talked with deutsche welle about some of the big ideas behind them . contemporary installation artist christo turns 75 this week , less than a year after the loss of his wife and artistic partner jeanne-claude .
deutsche welle spoke with christo about how he is moving forward with his work and what he thinks about its reception .
two museums in germany - the kunsthalle wuerth and the max ernst museum in bruehl - are currently displaying some of his works .
deutsche welle : you had such a symbiotic relationship with jeanne-claude .
how is it for you to continue work now on the projects you had planned together ?
christo : we always knew that one of us would be the first to go , and we 've known that for almost the last 50 years .
ever since we met in 1958 , we 've always traveled in separate planes so that one of us would be able to finish the work we started .
so , everything was in some way already prepared .
these projects take so long to get permission and to realize that we always envisioned this was possible .
many people struggle to understand the concept that you do n't work for money .
what does it say about our society that people have so much trouble grasping that you do art simply to create new art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wrapped reichstag " -lrb- 1995 -rrb- was realized 24 years after its conception this relates to the way i was brought up and educated in bulgaria under communism .
basically , the projects deal in large part with freedom .
of course , i do make money by selling the preparatory drawings and studies for the projects .
on paper , i put down my visions , jeanne-claude 's visions , our visions .
i also produce a variety of tangible goods to create the funds necessary to build projects that can not be bought and can not be owned - even jeanne-claude and i do n't own them .
the projects are about freedom .
freedom is the enemy of possession , and possession is equal to permanence .
you know , humans like to be in the presence of things that are unique like they are - things that wo n't happen again .
the projects have a quality of fragility and tenderness , like our own lives or our own childhood .
they can not be substituted or repeated .
but how much of a problem do you think our society has in understanding what you 're trying to do with your work ?
i would never think about that myself .
we like to build these projects because we enjoy it for ourselves , like any true artist .
any artist - an abstract painter , a watercolorist , whoever - enjoys and lives to do the work .
the projects begin from an almost visceral desire to realize something because you think it 's beautiful .
if somebody likes the work , it 's almost like a bonus - an additional dimension .
these projects deal with a very wide variety of aesthetic dimensions .
a 3-d work of art is different from a painting with a flat surface .
with a sculpture , you can move around it , you perceive the volume and dimensions .
but all of that space is entirely designed by the artist , who exercises an absurd amount of control over the space .
now , there 's another space we think very little about .
the moment you walk out of your home , somebody else designed the sidewalk , the roads and the lights .
basically 24 hours a day , we 're in a highly planned space that we do n't even think about .

cologne-based deg , part of the kfw banking group , lead the realization of the project .
bruno wenn , chairman of the board of management at deg will present this flagship project at the deutsche welle global media forum .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
within the framework of german development work , deg is responsible for financing investments of private companies for projects in developing and transition countries .
an example from the realm of climate change is the olkaria iii geothermal plant in kenya .
wenn says that the climate change debate has been shaped by the role of the public sector .
“ the participation of the private sector has mostly been missing in public discussions until now , ” he says .
for olkaria iii , 105 million dollars -lrb- us -rrb- were provided by outside financing .
deg ’ s requirements : the project must be “ operational , profitable , environmental and socially acceptable ” .
wenn is convinced that olkaria iii can be a glowing example for making climate projects profitable .
however , he also says that the private infrastructures that exist in developing countries are a major challenge .
when working on olkaria iii , deg benefited from kfw ’ s cooperation with the state-run power company in kenya , in order to get more investors on board .
wenn states that geothermal energy isn ’ t a futuristic vision .
“ the capacity in 2008 was just behind solar energy worldwide .
there is a lot of potential in the americas and in asia , ” says wenn .
“ the usa is currently the largest consumer of geothermal energy , followed by the philippines , indonesia and mexico . ”
it could also be important in africa .
“ olkaria iii is like the core in africa for further development in the region and a big step forward . ”
in bonn , wenn will make it clear that all stakeholders must reach a “ long-term , global agreement regarding the general conditions about climate change and the prevention of future greenhouse gas emissions . ”
more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .

although food is already in short supply there , local farmers are reluctant to plant new crop varieties that promise better yields . in drought-prone regions of africa , people are often bitterly poor and food is scarce .
unfortunately , the inhabitants of those regions are the very people who , experts say , will be the first to suffer the consequences of climate change .
while droughts used to occur in eastern africa every seven years , they now occur almost every other year .
this negatively impacts food output in the region .
one organization working to improve food security in africa is the coalition for african rice development , which wants to drastically reduce the continent 's reliance on expensive rice imports .
it hopes to develop resilient new rice varieties and distribute them to smallholder farmers , thereby doubling rice production to 28 million tons per annum by the year 2018 .
however , not all farmers are willing to plant modified seeds , whether they be rice , maize or any another crop .
farmers resist change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smallholder maize farms in africa are suffering from less rainfall and higher temperatures christina sabini runs a small farm near morogoro , tanzania with her husband , and says less rain and more heat have reduced harvests during recent years .
like other farmers in the region , sabini says she has no choice but to adapt to the changing climate .
last year , she was offered new tan250 maize seeds , which were researched and tested in kenya and zimbabwe .
" these seeds are better because they also survive droughts , and they do provide good yields .
even without using fertilizer , i can reap good maize , " she said .
sabini was one of the few regional farmers who chose to accept the seeds , and she believes she made the right decision .
others were more conservative and continued using the traditional varieties .
according to cynthia awuor , a climate expert with the non-governmental organization care in kenya , developing drought-resistant seeds is only half the challenge faced by those whose want to curb world hunger by increasing crop yields .
convincing farmers to voluntarily change their habits and plant the new seeds can be very difficult .
" there 's much more exploration into drought tolerant species of maize as well as other crops .

in the 1990 's , scientists cross bred a high-yield variety of asian rice with a stress-resistant african one .

although food is already in short supply there , local farmers are reluctant to plant new crop varieties that promise better yields . in drought-prone regions of africa , people are often bitterly poor and food is scarce .
unfortunately , the inhabitants of those regions are the very people who , experts say , will be the first to suffer the consequences of climate change .
while droughts used to occur in eastern africa every seven years , they now occur almost every other year .
this negatively impacts food output in the region .
one organization working to improve food security in africa is the coalition for african rice development , which wants to drastically reduce the continent 's reliance on expensive rice imports .

many thousands of refugees are fleeing the ethnic clashes , with the united nations warning of a possible humanitarian catastrophe . ethnic groups in kyrgyzstan clashed again in overnight battles as the official death toll in the country rose to at least 179 , according to a report by the kyrgyz news agency akipress , quoting the health ministry . the ministry said that it expected the actual number of dead to be much higher . troops were patrolling streets in the city of osh on wednesday morning , following clashes between kyrgyz groups and the uzbek minority .
the number of civilians forced to flee the violence is now put at 275,000 according to the united nations high commission for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- . united nations children 's fund unicef reports that women , children and the elderly make up more than 90 percent of the refugees .
the situation was growing increasingly serious , the head of the unhcr said on wednesday . " what is happening is already a tragedy and it could become a catastrophe . "
antonio guterres said during a visit to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic uzbeks have been gathering near the kyrgyz-uzbek border " we urgently need to find a political solution ... the country 's neighbors and the international community must do everything in their power to help the interim kyrgyz government restore peace and stability , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
officials in kyrgyzstan have warned that the ethnic conflict could spread to the country 's north and neighboring countries as aid agencies attempt to cope with the humanitarian crisis in the central asian country .
some 2,000 people have been wounded in the fighting which erupted last thursday , according to official figures .
violence in the southern cities of osh and jalalabad has raised fears over the future stability of the country of 5.3 million , where uzbeks make up 14 percent of the population .
aid groups working overtime uzbekistan has been struggling to deal with a flood of ethnic refugees who crossed the border to escape the unrest .
with around 75,000 refugees already inside uzbekistan after fleeing the southern cities , authorities said they had closed off the border to prevent that number from swelling .
however the office of the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , which has been working to get relief supplies into the central asian countries , told deutsche welle it understood the border has now been reopened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations high commissioner for refugees , antonio guterres , warned of catastrophe " we have this understanding that the border is open .
we understand that yesterday it was closed temporarily for the night and now it is open , " says unhcr spokesperson babar baloch .
" the un high commissioner here in geneva , antonio guterres , has welcomed the uzbek authorities ' decision to open the border and welcome refugees who are seeking asylum in uzbekistan . "
baloch says that the unhcr plans to send six relief planes in total with 240 metric tons of supplies to uzbekistan in the coming days .
he said this would be followed by more aid once the unhcr had established a presence on the ground .
baloch added that the unhcr had been experiencing problems in reaching displaced peoples in areas around osh because of the security situation .
" we had hoped to be able to reach those people .
we have some stocks on the ground at the unhcr warehouse there in osh and we already have been in touch with the icrc -lrb- international committee of the red cross -rrb- to distribute the items we have there , but we understand and we are concerned at the poor security situation in osh and jalalabad and other areas which is impeding aid delivery . "
bildunterschrift : bodies litter the street as houses burn in jalabad military intervention meanwhile , roza otunbayeva , the interim president of kyrgyzstan , said on tuesday that there was no reason for russia to intervene by deploying peacekeepers to the crisis region .
she said the clashes were beginning to wane and that she hoped that her country 's own forces could get the situation under control .
moscow says it considers the violence in southern kyrgyzstan an internal matter for that country and has only sent several hundred troops to defend a russian military base in kyrgyzstan .
both russia and the united states have military installations in the central asian country , with the us using the strategic position as a hub to support its forces in afghanistan .
otunbayeva also said a planned constitutional referendum would go ahead on june 27 .
she was speaking at a press conference after the eu had warned that the violent clashes threatened to derail the country 's reform process .
however this view is not shared by icrc head of operations for central asia and eastern europe , pascale meige wagner , who warned " we 're far from seeing the end of this crisis . "
" we hear extremely worrying stories about people targeted - there is a will to harm and kill in kyrgzystan . "

many thousands of refugees are fleeing the ethnic clashes , with the united nations warning of a possible humanitarian catastrophe . ethnic groups in kyrgyzstan clashed again in overnight battles as the official death toll in the country rose to at least 179 , according to a report by the kyrgyz news agency akipress , quoting the health ministry . the ministry said that it expected the actual number of dead to be much higher . troops were patrolling streets in the city of osh on wednesday morning , following clashes between kyrgyz groups and the uzbek minority .
the number of civilians forced to flee the violence is now put at 275,000 according to the united nations high commission for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- . united nations children 's fund unicef reports that women , children and the elderly make up more than 90 percent of the refugees .
the situation was growing increasingly serious , the head of the unhcr said on wednesday . " what is happening is already a tragedy and it could become a catastrophe . "
antonio guterres said during a visit to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic uzbeks have been gathering near the kyrgyz-uzbek border " we urgently need to find a political solution ... the country 's neighbors and the international community must do everything in their power to help the interim kyrgyz government restore peace and stability , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
officials in kyrgyzstan have warned that the ethnic conflict could spread to the country 's north and neighboring countries as aid agencies attempt to cope with the humanitarian crisis in the central asian country .
some 2,000 people have been wounded in the fighting which erupted last thursday , according to official figures .
violence in the southern cities of osh and jalalabad has raised fears over the future stability of the country of 5.3 million , where uzbeks make up 14 percent of the population .
aid groups working overtime uzbekistan has been struggling to deal with a flood of ethnic refugees who crossed the border to escape the unrest .
with around 75,000 refugees already inside uzbekistan after fleeing the southern cities , authorities said they had closed off the border to prevent that number from swelling .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations high commissioner for refugees , antonio guterres , warned of catastrophe " we have this understanding that the border is open .
we understand that yesterday it was closed temporarily for the night and now it is open , " says unhcr spokesperson babar baloch .
" the un high commissioner here in geneva , antonio guterres , has welcomed the uzbek authorities ' decision to open the border and welcome refugees who are seeking asylum in uzbekistan . "
baloch says that the unhcr plans to send six relief planes in total with 240 metric tons of supplies to uzbekistan in the coming days .
he said this would be followed by more aid once the unhcr had established a presence on the ground .
baloch added that the unhcr had been experiencing problems in reaching displaced peoples in areas around osh because of the security situation .
" we had hoped to be able to reach those people .
we have some stocks on the ground at the unhcr warehouse there in osh and we already have been in touch with the icrc -lrb- international committee of the red cross -rrb- to distribute the items we have there , but we understand and we are concerned at the poor security situation in osh and jalalabad and other areas which is impeding aid delivery .

she said the clashes were beginning to wane and that she hoped that her country 's own forces could get the situation under control .
moscow says it considers the violence in southern kyrgyzstan an internal matter for that country and has only sent several hundred troops to defend a russian military base in kyrgyzstan .
both russia and the united states have military installations in the central asian country , with the us using the strategic position as a hub to support its forces in afghanistan .
otunbayeva also said a planned constitutional referendum would go ahead on june 27 .
she was speaking at a press conference after the eu had warned that the violent clashes threatened to derail the country 's reform process .
however this view is not shared by icrc head of operations for central asia and eastern europe , pascale meige wagner , who warned " we 're far from seeing the end of this crisis . "
" we hear extremely worrying stories about people targeted - there is a will to harm and kill in kyrgzystan . "

with around 75,000 refugees already inside uzbekistan after fleeing the southern cities , authorities said they had closed off the border to prevent that number from swelling .
however the office of the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , which has been working to get relief supplies into the central asian countries , told deutsche welle it understood the border has now been reopened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations high commissioner for refugees , antonio guterres , warned of catastrophe " we have this understanding that the border is open .
we understand that yesterday it was closed temporarily for the night and now it is open , " says unhcr spokesperson babar baloch .
" the un high commissioner here in geneva , antonio guterres , has welcomed the uzbek authorities ' decision to open the border and welcome refugees who are seeking asylum in uzbekistan . "
baloch says that the unhcr plans to send six relief planes in total with 240 metric tons of supplies to uzbekistan in the coming days .
he said this would be followed by more aid once the unhcr had established a presence on the ground .
baloch added that the unhcr had been experiencing problems in reaching displaced peoples in areas around osh because of the security situation .
" we had hoped to be able to reach those people .
we have some stocks on the ground at the unhcr warehouse there in osh and we already have been in touch with the icrc -lrb- international committee of the red cross -rrb- to distribute the items we have there , but we understand and we are concerned at the poor security situation in osh and jalalabad and other areas which is impeding aid delivery . "
bildunterschrift : bodies litter the street as houses burn in jalabad military intervention meanwhile , roza otunbayeva , the interim president of kyrgyzstan , said on tuesday that there was no reason for russia to intervene by deploying peacekeepers to the crisis region .
she said the clashes were beginning to wane and that she hoped that her country 's own forces could get the situation under control .
moscow says it considers the violence in southern kyrgyzstan an internal matter for that country and has only sent several hundred troops to defend a russian military base in kyrgyzstan .
both russia and the united states have military installations in the central asian country , with the us using the strategic position as a hub to support its forces in afghanistan .
otunbayeva also said a planned constitutional referendum would go ahead on june 27 .
she was speaking at a press conference after the eu had warned that the violent clashes threatened to derail the country 's reform process .
however this view is not shared by icrc head of operations for central asia and eastern europe , pascale meige wagner , who warned " we 're far from seeing the end of this crisis . "
" we hear extremely worrying stories about people targeted - there is a will to harm and kill in kyrgzystan . "

but dams and manmade reservoirs also encroach upon humans , wildlife and natural habitats .
a company based in south western germany that specializes in making high-performance pumps is currently testing a solution that can use the power of the river without affecting its ecosystem .
dieter-heinz hellmann , member of the ksb board of management , will present the operating principle of the new river turbine at this year ’ s deutsche welle global media forum in bonn , germany .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
ksb engineers turned a basic principle on its head .
bchanging the direction of flow , a pump can be used as a turbine and vice versa .
in other words , by introducing flow to a pump propeller in reverse , it begins rotating and turns the pump into a turbine .
the motor then behaves like a generator and the pump produces electricity .
a seven-meter-long river turbine prototype has been operating since march 2010 in a tributary of the rhine river near st. goar , where it produces hydroelectricity without any disruptive dam constructions .
only a few buoys bob on the surface , indicating the location of the turbine .
initial tests have shown that the ksb turbine neither interferes with the river ’ s ecosystem nor impedes the migratory routes of fish .
engineers at the ksb group think that their innovation could revolutionize the use of hydropower .
trial operation is scheduled to take an ambitious plunge this summer when a single river turbine will be used to convert the currents of the rhine into electricity to power ten households . more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .

mineral resources worth about a trillion dollars have been found in afghanistan .
these include gold , iron , cobalt and lithium . the report about the pentagon 's huge afghan mineral finds and their economic potential has attracted a lot of attention in afghanistan .
many are upbeat about it .
abdurrahman ashraf , the advisor to president hamid karzai on mining issues , says that his government will conduct an in-depth investigation to verify the information .
" we have been given data which are necessary for the mining of the resources .
we will work with that , " he says .
" we will take samples on the ground and find out the mineral content of various deposits .
then we can say which deposits are economically worthwhile and which are not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president karzai 's government is conducting an investigation into the mineral deposits the information is not ' new ' the us government 's supposedly new information about the mineral riches is in fact not that new .
during the occupation of afghanistan in the 1980s , soviet geologists had already explored the soil and collected data .
after the withdrawal of the red army , afghan geologists hid the maps which their soviet colleagues had left behind .
the information remained under wraps until the western forces drove the taliban out of kabul in 2001 . the white house in washington seemed to have not known about the mineral resources until recently , when an internal memo by the us department of defense said the value of the deposits in afghanistan was about a trillion dollars .
sayfuddin sayhoon , an afghan economist believes that the us experts underestimate the wealth of his country : " the numbers given by the americans are understated .
some other sources even speak of a value of up to six trillion dollars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear that the taliban could intensify their insurgency after the recent revelations timing of the report experts in kabul wonder why washington has made this information public now .
some believe that the white house is trying to show us citizens that their soldiers are not fighting in vain , and that a lot of money is involved here .
economist sayhoon believes there could be other motives as well : " the us is warning us afghans and suggesting to us to consider exploiting and using these mineral resources .
moreover , the news is meant to attract the attention of western companies .
it seems that some western firms have already been contemplating about engaging in mining in afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several mineral deposits are hidden in the hindu kush mountains expertise needed maybe this is why karzai 's advisor abdurrahman ashraf is trying to play down the expectations .
" the mining and sale of these mineral resources require special expertise , which we do not have right now , " he says .
" moreover , our generation has not the right to sell everything . "
ashraf also suggests that afghans might prefer to sell the valuable mineral resources to china or india rather than to western buyers . experts however see such a statement as an attempt by the kabul government to use afghanistan 's mineral resources as an asset and to pit the west , china and india against each other - while keeping all options open . authors : arif farahmand , cem sey / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dams and manmade reservoirs also encroach upon humans , wildlife and natural habitats .
a company based in south western germany that specializes in making high-performance pumps is currently testing a solution that can use the power of the river without affecting its ecosystem .
dieter-heinz hellmann , member of the ksb board of management , will present the operating principle of the new river turbine at this year ’ s deutsche welle global media forum in bonn , germany .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
ksb engineers turned a basic principle on its head .
bchanging the direction of flow , a pump can be used as a turbine and vice versa .
in other words , by introducing flow to a pump propeller in reverse , it begins rotating and turns the pump into a turbine .
the motor then behaves like a generator and the pump produces electricity .
a seven-meter-long river turbine prototype has been operating since march 2010 in a tributary of the rhine river near st. goar , where it produces hydroelectricity without any disruptive dam constructions .
only a few buoys bob on the surface , indicating the location of the turbine .
initial tests have shown that the ksb turbine neither interferes with the river ’ s ecosystem nor impedes the migratory routes of fish .
engineers at the ksb group think that their innovation could revolutionize the use of hydropower .
trial operation is scheduled to take an ambitious plunge this summer when a single river turbine will be used to convert the currents of the rhine into electricity to power ten households . more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .
deutsche welle is cooperating with many different organizations for this interdisciplinary conference , including the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the international human dimensions program on global environmental change -lrb- un ihdp / essp -rrb- , eu commission and the world bank , the wuppertal institute , world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , nabu and the climate alliance , the institute for world business kiel , german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- , the center for development research -lrb- zef -rrb- and many others .
co-host of the deutsche welle global media forum is the foundation for international dialogue of the sparkasse in bonn .
the convention is also supported by germany ’ s federal foreign office , the family , women and integration ministry of the german state of north rhine-westphalia , european funds for regional development , the city of bonn , dhl , the ksb group and faber-castell .

mineral resources worth about a trillion dollars have been found in afghanistan .
these include gold , iron , cobalt and lithium . the report about the pentagon 's huge afghan mineral finds and their economic potential has attracted a lot of attention in afghanistan .
many are upbeat about it .
abdurrahman ashraf , the advisor to president hamid karzai on mining issues , says that his government will conduct an in-depth investigation to verify the information .
" we have been given data which are necessary for the mining of the resources .
we will work with that , " he says .
" we will take samples on the ground and find out the mineral content of various deposits .

after the withdrawal of the red army , afghan geologists hid the maps which their soviet colleagues had left behind .
the information remained under wraps until the western forces drove the taliban out of kabul in 2001 . the white house in washington seemed to have not known about the mineral resources until recently , when an internal memo by the us department of defense said the value of the deposits in afghanistan was about a trillion dollars .

economist sayhoon believes there could be other motives as well : " the us is warning us afghans and suggesting to us to consider exploiting and using these mineral resources .

" moreover , our generation has not the right to sell everything . "
ashraf also suggests that afghans might prefer to sell the valuable mineral resources to china or india rather than to western buyers . experts however see such a statement as an attempt by the kabul government to use afghanistan 's mineral resources as an asset and to pit the west , china and india against each other - while keeping all options open . authors : arif farahmand , cem sey / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a military band played the " yorck march " as a formation of bundeswehr soldiers marched onto the park outside berlin 's bellevue palace , the official government residence .
the band also played " marsch der elisabether " by johann strauss and william handy 's " st. louis blues , " which koehler had requested .
the military ceremony is the highest in germany and performed only for the president , chancellor and defense minister .
speeches are not part of such ceremonies , but koehler was invited to a private reception at the presidential office by acting president and bremen mayor jens boehrnsen .
speaking in front of around 200 guests , koehler defended his much criticized resignation .
" i made the decision that i held - and still hold - to be right , " he said , according to a statement from the office of the president .

now , according to india 's official press information bureau , afghanistan has invited india to invest in its mining sector , particularly in mining iron ore , copper , gold and coal . during a visit to india on tuesday , afghanistan 's mines minister wahidullah shahrani also sought india 's know-how in the field of mineral exploration .
he also said that afghanistan will launch a road show in london on june 25 , in which about 200 companies from across the globe will be invited to showcase their mining and exploration potential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's mines minister wahidullah shahrani india needs minerals and metals experts say resource-hungry india is not likely to forgo any opportunity to extract afghanistan 's untapped valuable mineral deposits , which also include lithium , a key material used in a wide range of consumer products . " india is an expanding economy and our requirements for different types of minerals will go up , " says santosh kumar , a former indian diplomat in new delhi .
" india is among the leading technological countries in the world .
and in those technologies like for example aerospace and so on , there are new metals and new applications for these metals required .
since we do n't have these metals and rare earths in india , some of them we import , so obviously any discoveries in our neighborhood would be of interest to us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign secretary nirupama rao visits the indian embassy in kabul following a suicide attack in 2009 security is a challenge but expert kumar also points out that indian companies working in the field have some serious concerns : " for them , there are two problems .
one is the security situation .
the second is that these minerals are found in parts which are not well connected .
so transport is a critical issue . " following the attacks that killed seven indians in kabul earlier this year , new delhi has often expressed worries over the security of its nationals in afghanistan . many observers in the us also believe that security problems , weak infrastructure and corruption will be a hindrance for digging up the mineral riches .
there are also concerns that the taliban could intensify their campaign now that they know that afghanistan is sitting on a goldmine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chinese delegation visiting the site of a copper mine in aynak in 2007 china and pakistan but given the scale of afghanistan 's mineral wealth , many may not hesitate to take a risk .
be it the americans themselves or the chinese , who have already invested in the vast aynak copper mine , south of kabul .
ye hailin , an expert from the chinese academy of social sciences , is cautious though .
" why would you connect this news with china ?
the us is the major player in afghanistan .
one should ask , what sort of new strategy can the united states plan now . " and what about afghanistan 's immediate neighbor pakistan ?
shahid kardar , a pakistani economist , believes that pakistan would rather be interested in providing logistical support than going for full-fledged investment . " i do n't think we will ever be in a position to be a serious investor .
but certainly in terms of being part of a value chain , in providing some low and middle level management , labor , transport and so on , we would be certainly better equipped than chinese and americans .

but certainly in terms of being part of a value chain , in providing some low and middle level management , labor , transport and so on , we would be certainly better equipped than chinese and americans .

cologne-based deg , part of the kfw banking group , lead the realization of the project .
bruno wenn , chairman of the board of management at deg will present this flagship project at the deutsche welle global media forum .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
within the framework of german development work , deg is responsible for financing investments of private companies for projects in developing and transition countries .
an example from the realm of climate change is the olkaria iii geothermal plant in kenya .
wenn says that the climate change debate has been shaped by the role of the public sector .
“ the participation of the private sector has mostly been missing in public discussions until now , ” he says .
for olkaria iii , 105 million dollars -lrb- us -rrb- were provided by outside financing .
deg ’ s requirements : the project must be “ operational , profitable , environmental and socially acceptable ” .
wenn is convinced that olkaria iii can be a glowing example for making climate projects profitable .
however , he also says that the private infrastructures that exist in developing countries are a major challenge .
when working on olkaria iii , deg benefited from kfw ’ s cooperation with the state-run power company in kenya , in order to get more investors on board .
wenn states that geothermal energy isn ’ t a futuristic vision .
“ the capacity in 2008 was just behind solar energy worldwide .
there is a lot of potential in the americas and in asia , ” says wenn .
“ the usa is currently the largest consumer of geothermal energy , followed by the philippines , indonesia and mexico . ”
it could also be important in africa .
“ olkaria iii is like the core in africa for further development in the region and a big step forward . ”
in bonn , wenn will make it clear that all stakeholders must reach a “ long-term , global agreement regarding the general conditions about climate change and the prevention of future greenhouse gas emissions . ”
more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .
deutsche welle is cooperating with many different organizations for this interdisciplinary conference , including the unesco , the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the international human dimensions program on global environmental change -lrb- un ihdp / essp -rrb- , eu commission and the world bank , the wuppertal institute , world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , nabu and the climate alliance , the institute for world business kiel , german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- , the center for development research -lrb- zef -rrb- and many others .

the artist talked with deutsche welle about some of the big ideas behind them . contemporary installation artist christo turns 75 this week , less than a year after the loss of his wife and artistic partner jeanne-claude .
deutsche welle spoke with christo about how he is moving forward with his work and what he thinks about its reception .
two museums in germany - the kunsthalle wuerth and the max ernst museum in bruehl - are currently displaying some of his works .
deutsche welle : you had such a symbiotic relationship with jeanne-claude .
how is it for you to continue work now on the projects you had planned together ?
christo : we always knew that one of us would be the first to go , and we 've known that for almost the last 50 years .
ever since we met in 1958 , we 've always traveled in separate planes so that one of us would be able to finish the work we started .
so , everything was in some way already prepared .
these projects take so long to get permission and to realize that we always envisioned this was possible .
many people struggle to understand the concept that you do n't work for money .
what does it say about our society that people have so much trouble grasping that you do art simply to create new art ?

basically , the projects deal in large part with freedom .
of course , i do make money by selling the preparatory drawings and studies for the projects .
on paper , i put down my visions , jeanne-claude 's visions , our visions .
i also produce a variety of tangible goods to create the funds necessary to build projects that can not be bought and can not be owned - even jeanne-claude and i do n't own them .
the projects are about freedom .
freedom is the enemy of possession , and possession is equal to permanence .
you know , humans like to be in the presence of things that are unique like they are - things that wo n't happen again .
the projects have a quality of fragility and tenderness , like our own lives or our own childhood .
they can not be substituted or repeated .
but how much of a problem do you think our society has in understanding what you 're trying to do with your work ?
i would never think about that myself .
we like to build these projects because we enjoy it for ourselves , like any true artist .
any artist - an abstract painter , a watercolorist , whoever - enjoys and lives to do the work .
the projects begin from an almost visceral desire to realize something because you think it 's beautiful .
if somebody likes the work , it 's almost like a bonus - an additional dimension .
these projects deal with a very wide variety of aesthetic dimensions .
a 3-d work of art is different from a painting with a flat surface .
with a sculpture , you can move around it , you perceive the volume and dimensions .
but all of that space is entirely designed by the artist , who exercises an absurd amount of control over the space .
now , there 's another space we think very little about .
the moment you walk out of your home , somebody else designed the sidewalk , the roads and the lights .
basically 24 hours a day , we 're in a highly planned space that we do n't even think about .
in our work , we more or less borrow that space and create a gentle disturbance for a few days .
by doing so , we inherit everything inherent to that space , and it becomes a part of the work of art .

mineral resources worth about a trillion dollars have been found in afghanistan .
these include gold , iron , cobalt and lithium . the report about the pentagon 's huge afghan mineral finds and their economic potential has attracted a lot of attention in afghanistan .
many are upbeat about it .
abdurrahman ashraf , the advisor to president hamid karzai on mining issues , says that his government will conduct an in-depth investigation to verify the information .
" we have been given data which are necessary for the mining of the resources .
we will work with that , " he says .
" we will take samples on the ground and find out the mineral content of various deposits .
then we can say which deposits are economically worthwhile and which are not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president karzai 's government is conducting an investigation into the mineral deposits the information is not ' new ' the us government 's supposedly new information about the mineral riches is in fact not that new .
during the occupation of afghanistan in the 1980s , soviet geologists had already explored the soil and collected data .
after the withdrawal of the red army , afghan geologists hid the maps which their soviet colleagues had left behind .
the information remained under wraps until the western forces drove the taliban out of kabul in 2001 . the white house in washington seemed to have not known about the mineral resources until recently , when an internal memo by the us department of defense said the value of the deposits in afghanistan was about a trillion dollars .

ashraf also suggests that afghans might prefer to sell the valuable mineral resources to china or india rather than to western buyers . experts however see such a statement as an attempt by the kabul government to use afghanistan 's mineral resources as an asset and to pit the west , china and india against each other - while keeping all options open . authors : arif farahmand , cem sey / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gm also said that no further layoffs at opel were on the cards . us auto giant general motors has dropped its request for financial backing from european governments for its carmaker opel , saying it would restructure its european subsidiary itself .
further layoffs at opel have also been shelved .
opel said in a statement that it laid blame for the back flip on the lengthy process of obtaining government loan guarantees from germany , britain , spain , poland , austria and belgium - in which it employs some 48,000 workers altogether .
britain and spain had offered loan guarantees , but gm would now do without any government help .
" the validity and reasons for requesting government guarantees have ... not changed but the process has proven to be much more complex and longer than anticipated , " the firm said in a statement .
" gm 's recently improved financial strength has also been a catalyst for making this decision . "
the move comes as a surprise after gm for months insisted it needed european governments to pitch in to restructure opel .
no more layoffs opel said there would be no layoffs or plant closures beyond those already announced at the beginning of this year .
those measures called for opel to lose 8,300 workers in europe and close a plant in belgium .
gm had asked the european governments for 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees to restructure opel .
last week , germany , home to 23,000 opel employees , categorically ruled out providing its share of the guarantee - estimated at 1.1 billion euros - saying that gm had enough money of its own .
however , the four german states which have opel plants were looking at whether they could step in and at least partly fill the gap .
chief executive nick reilly has been pushing for a plan to invest 11 billion euros in the company until 2014 , updating 80 per cent of the opel model range .

earlier , in group h , switzerland shocked spain 1-0 , while chile overcame honduras by the same score line . uruguay have beaten south africa 3-0 in the second round of group a games at the world cup , pushing the south americans up to four points and leaving bafana bafana languishing on one point .
south africa started the game with energy and tight passing , taking it to the uruguayan defense .
however the dominant possession did n't pay dividends for the hosts , when uruguay scored in the 23rd minute through a looping shot from outside the box by atletico madrid striker diego forlan .
the ball tucked under the crossbar and into the back of the net , leaving south african keeper itumeleng khune helpless .
the goal did n't have a huge impact on south africa 's composure , but from that point onwards the possession balanced out and uruguay was allowed more time in their attacking third .
uruguay started the second half a different team , keeping the south african defense under pressure for the opening 15 minutes .
south africa seemed somewhat lackluster with the ball and were unable to threaten their opponent 's goal until the 65th minute after a cross from the right by siboniso gaxa to the near post met katlego mphela 's head , though the forward pushed the ball wide .
the death knell for south africa came in the 76th minute when khune was red carded for bringing down ajax striker luis suarez in the box after he was clear on goal .
forlan coolly smashed home the resultant penalty kick .
uruguay made it 3-0 with a close-range header from alvaro pereira deep in injury time from a suarez cross .
south africa must now hope for a win next tuesday against france if they are to have any hope of progressing to the round of 16 .
shock in nelspruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland upset spain , who were title favorites in wednesday 's afternoon match , european title holders spain were toppled in their first world cup match after going down 1-0 in a shock loss to ottmar hitzfeld ’ s switzerland .
the swiss took the lead in the 52nd minute through a scrappy goal against the run of play from gelson fernandes , who picked up a loose ball after spanish keeper iker casillas collided with eren derdiyok in the box .
xavi alonso went closest to equalizing for the spaniards in the 70th minute when his shot from the edge of the box rebounded off the crossbar .
switzerland nearly went 2-0 up four minutes later when derdiyok weaved past two men in the box and struck the right post after a deft shot with the outside of his right boot .
the victory is the first for switzerland over spain in 19 meetings and represents by far the greatest upset so far in the world cup in south africa .
spain dominated possession in the first 45 minutes , getting most of their team behind the ball .
the best chance fell to gerard pique , who cut back inside swiss defender stephane grichting but saw his shot rebound off the legs of keeper diego benaglio .
despite showing sparks of brilliance with the ball , spain rarely threatened during the half , while switzerland , too , lacked any real scoring opportunities .
vicente del bosque 's spain , which , going into the tournament , was among the teams most favored to lift the world cup , were expected to come away with all three points against switzerland .
victory after 48 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beausejour -lrb- in red -rrb- shoots to score past honduras goalkeeper noel valladares in the day 's opening group h match , chile ended a 48-year winless streak in the world cup by overcoming honduras 1-0 at mbombela stadium in nelspruit .
striker jean beausejour bagged the only goal of the game .
in a game which it dominated , chile were unlucky not to extend their lead after man-of-the-match beausejour 's 34th minute strike .
the goal followed some slick passing in the honduran box which created space for mauricio isla on the right flank to get a low cross in at the near post , which was turned in by the mexico-based beausejour .
chile defender waldo ponce came forward for a free kick midway through the second half and should have doubled the lead only for veteran goalie noel valladares to parry away a diving point-blank header .
midfielder jorge valdivia had another chance at the goal 15 minutes from full-time , but was correctly flagged offside as the " killer " second goal continued to elude chile .

earlier , in group h , switzerland shocked spain 1-0 , while chile overcame honduras by the same score line . uruguay have beaten south africa 3-0 in the second round of group a games at the world cup , pushing the south americans up to four points and leaving bafana bafana languishing on one point .
south africa started the game with energy and tight passing , taking it to the uruguayan defense .
however the dominant possession did n't pay dividends for the hosts , when uruguay scored in the 23rd minute through a looping shot from outside the box by atletico madrid striker diego forlan .
the ball tucked under the crossbar and into the back of the net , leaving south african keeper itumeleng khune helpless .
the goal did n't have a huge impact on south africa 's composure , but from that point onwards the possession balanced out and uruguay was allowed more time in their attacking third .
uruguay started the second half a different team , keeping the south african defense under pressure for the opening 15 minutes .
south africa seemed somewhat lackluster with the ball and were unable to threaten their opponent 's goal until the 65th minute after a cross from the right by siboniso gaxa to the near post met katlego mphela 's head , though the forward pushed the ball wide .
the death knell for south africa came in the 76th minute when khune was red carded for bringing down ajax striker luis suarez in the box after he was clear on goal .
forlan coolly smashed home the resultant penalty kick .
uruguay made it 3-0 with a close-range header from alvaro pereira deep in injury time from a suarez cross .
south africa must now hope for a win next tuesday against france if they are to have any hope of progressing to the round of 16 .
shock in nelspruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland upset spain , who were title favorites in wednesday 's afternoon match , european title holders spain were toppled in their first world cup match after going down 1-0 in a shock loss to ottmar hitzfeld ’ s switzerland .
the swiss took the lead in the 52nd minute through a scrappy goal against the run of play from gelson fernandes , who picked up a loose ball after spanish keeper iker casillas collided with eren derdiyok in the box .
xavi alonso went closest to equalizing for the spaniards in the 70th minute when his shot from the edge of the box rebounded off the crossbar .
switzerland nearly went 2-0 up four minutes later when derdiyok weaved past two men in the box and struck the right post after a deft shot with the outside of his right boot .
the victory is the first for switzerland over spain in 19 meetings and represents by far the greatest upset so far in the world cup in south africa .
spain dominated possession in the first 45 minutes , getting most of their team behind the ball .
the best chance fell to gerard pique , who cut back inside swiss defender stephane grichting but saw his shot rebound off the legs of keeper diego benaglio .
despite showing sparks of brilliance with the ball , spain rarely threatened during the half , while switzerland , too , lacked any real scoring opportunities .
vicente del bosque 's spain , which , going into the tournament , was among the teams most favored to lift the world cup , were expected to come away with all three points against switzerland .
victory after 48 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beausejour -lrb- in red -rrb- shoots to score past honduras goalkeeper noel valladares in the day 's opening group h match , chile ended a 48-year winless streak in the world cup by overcoming honduras 1-0 at mbombela stadium in nelspruit .
striker jean beausejour bagged the only goal of the game .
in a game which it dominated , chile were unlucky not to extend their lead after man-of-the-match beausejour 's 34th minute strike .
the goal followed some slick passing in the honduran box which created space for mauricio isla on the right flank to get a low cross in at the near post , which was turned in by the mexico-based beausejour .
chile defender waldo ponce came forward for a free kick midway through the second half and should have doubled the lead only for veteran goalie noel valladares to parry away a diving point-blank header .
midfielder jorge valdivia had another chance at the goal 15 minutes from full-time , but was correctly flagged offside as the " killer " second goal continued to elude chile .

earlier , in group h , switzerland shocked spain 1-0 , while chile overcame honduras by the same score line . uruguay have beaten south africa 3-0 in the second round of group a games at the world cup , pushing the south americans up to four points and leaving bafana bafana languishing on one point .
south africa started the game with energy and tight passing , taking it to the uruguayan defense .
however the dominant possession did n't pay dividends for the hosts , when uruguay scored in the 23rd minute through a looping shot from outside the box by atletico madrid striker diego forlan .
the ball tucked under the crossbar and into the back of the net , leaving south african keeper itumeleng khune helpless .
the goal did n't have a huge impact on south africa 's composure , but from that point onwards the possession balanced out and uruguay was allowed more time in their attacking third .
uruguay started the second half a different team , keeping the south african defense under pressure for the opening 15 minutes .
south africa seemed somewhat lackluster with the ball and were unable to threaten their opponent 's goal until the 65th minute after a cross from the right by siboniso gaxa to the near post met katlego mphela 's head , though the forward pushed the ball wide .
the death knell for south africa came in the 76th minute when khune was red carded for bringing down ajax striker luis suarez in the box after he was clear on goal .
forlan coolly smashed home the resultant penalty kick .
uruguay made it 3-0 with a close-range header from alvaro pereira deep in injury time from a suarez cross .
south africa must now hope for a win next tuesday against france if they are to have any hope of progressing to the round of 16 .
shock in nelspruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland upset spain , who were title favorites in wednesday 's afternoon match , european title holders spain were toppled in their first world cup match after going down 1-0 in a shock loss to ottmar hitzfeld ’ s switzerland .
the swiss took the lead in the 52nd minute through a scrappy goal against the run of play from gelson fernandes , who picked up a loose ball after spanish keeper iker casillas collided with eren derdiyok in the box .
xavi alonso went closest to equalizing for the spaniards in the 70th minute when his shot from the edge of the box rebounded off the crossbar .
switzerland nearly went 2-0 up four minutes later when derdiyok weaved past two men in the box and struck the right post after a deft shot with the outside of his right boot .
the victory is the first for switzerland over spain in 19 meetings and represents by far the greatest upset so far in the world cup in south africa .
spain dominated possession in the first 45 minutes , getting most of their team behind the ball .
the best chance fell to gerard pique , who cut back inside swiss defender stephane grichting but saw his shot rebound off the legs of keeper diego benaglio .
despite showing sparks of brilliance with the ball , spain rarely threatened during the half , while switzerland , too , lacked any real scoring opportunities .
vicente del bosque 's spain , which , going into the tournament , was among the teams most favored to lift the world cup , were expected to come away with all three points against switzerland .
victory after 48 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beausejour -lrb- in red -rrb- shoots to score past honduras goalkeeper noel valladares in the day 's opening group h match , chile ended a 48-year winless streak in the world cup by overcoming honduras 1-0 at mbombela stadium in nelspruit .
striker jean beausejour bagged the only goal of the game .
in a game which it dominated , chile were unlucky not to extend their lead after man-of-the-match beausejour 's 34th minute strike .
the goal followed some slick passing in the honduran box which created space for mauricio isla on the right flank to get a low cross in at the near post , which was turned in by the mexico-based beausejour .
chile defender waldo ponce came forward for a free kick midway through the second half and should have doubled the lead only for veteran goalie noel valladares to parry away a diving point-blank header .
midfielder jorge valdivia had another chance at the goal 15 minutes from full-time , but was correctly flagged offside as the " killer " second goal continued to elude chile .

that is the main finding of a new report presented by the german education ministry . more evidence of the desperate state of germany 's education system was revealed on wednesday , with the pre-publication of statistics from a new " education in germany " report .
according to the report , which is to be presented thursday by the german education ministry and the state conference on education , an assembly of germany 's state education ministers , 17 percent of young germans aged between 20 and 30 have no vocational qualification and are no longer in the education system .
this marks a new high - in 2007 , the figure was still at 15.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezdemir is convinced the problems are endemic the situation is particularly dire among young people with an immigrant background , 30 percent of whom have no formal training and no prospect of achieving further qualifications .
in the face of increasing pressures in the job market , the researchers warned that germany could be facing a long-term unemployment problem for those without formal qualifications .
one forecast predicts that the supply of unqualified workers would exceed the number of jobs in this sector by some 1.3 million for the next 15 years .
for cem oezdemir , education spokesman for the green party , the deficits in germany 's system are appalling .
" we 're talking about a sort of risk-group that leaves school lacking basic reading , writing and arithmetic skills - they are functionally illiterate , " he told deutsche welle .
no surprises problems have been endemic for years , and the report 's findings provide few surprises for those concerned with german education .
stephanie odenwald , director for vocational training at the educational workers ' union gew , said , " it 's not a surprise - everyone who knows the education system has known this problem for years . "
odenwald can also identify one of the main causes of the problem : " it is mainly the fault of the misguided development of this massive transitional system , where young people leave school and do n't get into job training programs and instead get put into these waiting loops , or ' job preparation schemes ' as they are known .
there is a very wide body of opinion that says we need to get rid of this system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with an immigrant background are particularly disadvantaged this transitional system has often been blamed for leaving many of germany 's young people in limbo after leaving school , but oezdemir says that the problems are much deeper .
" what this study makes clear is that we need to question our whole education system - from kindergarten all the way to university , " he said .
" the interim system is just one element of it . "
the sacred cow gymnasium the new report is one of many that have indirectly brought attention to the injustices in germany 's three-tiered school system , which divides students according to ability into one of three different schools after the fourth grade - these are the hauptschule , the realschule and the elite gymnasium .
international comparisons like the pisa studies have highlighted the social inequalities that are caused by this system .
the report shows that hauptschule students continue to have problems finding job training places , even though the competition for them is said to be decreasing .
as far as oezdemir is concerned , germany 's conservative government resists reform because it is clinging to the gymnasium .
" there really is n't a recognition problem , " he says .
" these studies always come out with similar results .
there is an application problem .
we know the problems , but the politicians get bogged down in financial questions , and the taboo of the gymnasium .
the schools need to fit our children , not the other way round . "

trade unions are up in arms about the plan . french workers are facing the prospect of having to work for two more years before qualifying for a pension , as the minimum retirement age is set to rise to 62 .
details of the planned change , which was expected to meet strong resistance from trade unions , were announced by french labor minister eric woerth . " working longer is inevitable , " woerth told reporters following a meeting with president nicolas sarkozy on tuesday .
" there is not a magical solution . "
" all of our partners in europe have done it .
it is no longer possible to stay on the sidelines of this movement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woerth announced the plans after a meeting with president sarkozy on tuesday , tens of thousands of people demonstrated against the reforms in the runup to the announcement .
police said that 23,000 people took part in a march in paris , with union officials putting the figure at 70,000 .
future protests promised a bill on the changes is to be presented to the french cabinet in july before going before parliament in september .
unions have promised that they will fight the reforms with demonstrations and strikes .
the french government is introducing the changes , to be fully implemented by 2018 , in bid to trim spending on welfare and preserve its credit rating .
the right to a pension from the age of 60 has been part of the french system since 1982 .
under the present system , individuals can draw a full pension from the age of 60 provided that they have paid social security contributions for a minimum of 40 years and six months .
the reforms would also change the contribution period to 41 years .

trade unions are up in arms about the plan . french workers are facing the prospect of having to work for two more years before qualifying for a pension , as the minimum retirement age is set to rise to 62 .
details of the planned change , which was expected to meet strong resistance from trade unions , were announced by french labor minister eric woerth . " working longer is inevitable , " woerth told reporters following a meeting with president nicolas sarkozy on tuesday .
" there is not a magical solution . "
" all of our partners in europe have done it .
it is no longer possible to stay on the sidelines of this movement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woerth announced the plans after a meeting with president sarkozy on tuesday , tens of thousands of people demonstrated against the reforms in the runup to the announcement .
police said that 23,000 people took part in a march in paris , with union officials putting the figure at 70,000 .
future protests promised a bill on the changes is to be presented to the french cabinet in july before going before parliament in september .
unions have promised that they will fight the reforms with demonstrations and strikes .
the french government is introducing the changes , to be fully implemented by 2018 , in bid to trim spending on welfare and preserve its credit rating .
the right to a pension from the age of 60 has been part of the french system since 1982 .
under the present system , individuals can draw a full pension from the age of 60 provided that they have paid social security contributions for a minimum of 40 years and six months .
the reforms would also change the contribution period to 41 years .

that is the main finding of a new report presented by the german education ministry . more evidence of the desperate state of germany 's education system was revealed on wednesday , with the pre-publication of statistics from a new " education in germany " report .
according to the report , which is to be presented thursday by the german education ministry and the state conference on education , an assembly of germany 's state education ministers , 17 percent of young germans aged between 20 and 30 have no vocational qualification and are no longer in the education system .
this marks a new high - in 2007 , the figure was still at 15.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezdemir is convinced the problems are endemic the situation is particularly dire among young people with an immigrant background , 30 percent of whom have no formal training and no prospect of achieving further qualifications .
in the face of increasing pressures in the job market , the researchers warned that germany could be facing a long-term unemployment problem for those without formal qualifications .
one forecast predicts that the supply of unqualified workers would exceed the number of jobs in this sector by some 1.3 million for the next 15 years .
for cem oezdemir , education spokesman for the green party , the deficits in germany 's system are appalling .
" we 're talking about a sort of risk-group that leaves school lacking basic reading , writing and arithmetic skills - they are functionally illiterate , " he told deutsche welle .
no surprises problems have been endemic for years , and the report 's findings provide few surprises for those concerned with german education .
stephanie odenwald , director for vocational training at the educational workers ' union gew , said , " it 's not a surprise - everyone who knows the education system has known this problem for years . "
odenwald can also identify one of the main causes of the problem : " it is mainly the fault of the misguided development of this massive transitional system , where young people leave school and do n't get into job training programs and instead get put into these waiting loops , or ' job preparation schemes ' as they are known .
there is a very wide body of opinion that says we need to get rid of this system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with an immigrant background are particularly disadvantaged this transitional system has often been blamed for leaving many of germany 's young people in limbo after leaving school , but oezdemir says that the problems are much deeper .
" what this study makes clear is that we need to question our whole education system - from kindergarten all the way to university , " he said .
" the interim system is just one element of it . "
the sacred cow gymnasium the new report is one of many that have indirectly brought attention to the injustices in germany 's three-tiered school system , which divides students according to ability into one of three different schools after the fourth grade - these are the hauptschule , the realschule and the elite gymnasium .
international comparisons like the pisa studies have highlighted the social inequalities that are caused by this system .
the report shows that hauptschule students continue to have problems finding job training places , even though the competition for them is said to be decreasing .
as far as oezdemir is concerned , germany 's conservative government resists reform because it is clinging to the gymnasium .
" there really is n't a recognition problem , " he says .
" these studies always come out with similar results .
there is an application problem .
we know the problems , but the politicians get bogged down in financial questions , and the taboo of the gymnasium .
the schools need to fit our children , not the other way round . "

earlier , in group h , switzerland shocked spain 1-0 , while chile overcame honduras by the same score line . uruguay have beaten south africa 3-0 in the second round of group a games at the world cup , pushing the south americans up to four points and leaving bafana bafana languishing on one point .
south africa started the game with energy and tight passing , taking it to the uruguayan defense .
however the dominant possession did n't pay dividends for the hosts , when uruguay scored in the 23rd minute through a looping shot from outside the box by atletico madrid striker diego forlan .
the ball tucked under the crossbar and into the back of the net , leaving south african keeper itumeleng khune helpless .
the goal did n't have a huge impact on south africa 's composure , but from that point onwards the possession balanced out and uruguay was allowed more time in their attacking third .
uruguay started the second half a different team , keeping the south african defense under pressure for the opening 15 minutes .
south africa seemed somewhat lackluster with the ball and were unable to threaten their opponent 's goal until the 65th minute after a cross from the right by siboniso gaxa to the near post met katlego mphela 's head , though the forward pushed the ball wide .
the death knell for south africa came in the 76th minute when khune was red carded for bringing down ajax striker luis suarez in the box after he was clear on goal .
forlan coolly smashed home the resultant penalty kick .
uruguay made it 3-0 with a close-range header from alvaro pereira deep in injury time from a suarez cross .
south africa must now hope for a win next tuesday against france if they are to have any hope of progressing to the round of 16 .
shock in nelspruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland upset spain , who were title favorites in wednesday 's afternoon match , european title holders spain were toppled in their first world cup match after going down 1-0 in a shock loss to ottmar hitzfeld ’ s switzerland .
the swiss took the lead in the 52nd minute through a scrappy goal against the run of play from gelson fernandes , who picked up a loose ball after spanish keeper iker casillas collided with eren derdiyok in the box .
xavi alonso went closest to equalizing for the spaniards in the 70th minute when his shot from the edge of the box rebounded off the crossbar .
switzerland nearly went 2-0 up four minutes later when derdiyok weaved past two men in the box and struck the right post after a deft shot with the outside of his right boot .
the victory is the first for switzerland over spain in 19 meetings and represents by far the greatest upset so far in the world cup in south africa .
spain dominated possession in the first 45 minutes , getting most of their team behind the ball .
the best chance fell to gerard pique , who cut back inside swiss defender stephane grichting but saw his shot rebound off the legs of keeper diego benaglio .
despite showing sparks of brilliance with the ball , spain rarely threatened during the half , while switzerland , too , lacked any real scoring opportunities .
vicente del bosque 's spain , which , going into the tournament , was among the teams most favored to lift the world cup , were expected to come away with all three points against switzerland .
victory after 48 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beausejour -lrb- in red -rrb- shoots to score past honduras goalkeeper noel valladares in the day 's opening group h match , chile ended a 48-year winless streak in the world cup by overcoming honduras 1-0 at mbombela stadium in nelspruit .
striker jean beausejour bagged the only goal of the game .
in a game which it dominated , chile were unlucky not to extend their lead after man-of-the-match beausejour 's 34th minute strike .
the goal followed some slick passing in the honduran box which created space for mauricio isla on the right flank to get a low cross in at the near post , which was turned in by the mexico-based beausejour .
chile defender waldo ponce came forward for a free kick midway through the second half and should have doubled the lead only for veteran goalie noel valladares to parry away a diving point-blank header .
midfielder jorge valdivia had another chance at the goal 15 minutes from full-time , but was correctly flagged offside as the " killer " second goal continued to elude chile .

mineral resources worth about a trillion dollars have been found in afghanistan .
these include gold , iron , cobalt and lithium . the report about the pentagon 's huge afghan mineral finds and their economic potential has attracted a lot of attention in afghanistan .
many are upbeat about it .
abdurrahman ashraf , the advisor to president hamid karzai on mining issues , says that his government will conduct an in-depth investigation to verify the information .
" we have been given data which are necessary for the mining of the resources .
we will work with that , " he says .
" we will take samples on the ground and find out the mineral content of various deposits .
then we can say which deposits are economically worthwhile and which are not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president karzai 's government is conducting an investigation into the mineral deposits the information is not ' new ' the us government 's supposedly new information about the mineral riches is in fact not that new .
during the occupation of afghanistan in the 1980s , soviet geologists had already explored the soil and collected data .
after the withdrawal of the red army , afghan geologists hid the maps which their soviet colleagues had left behind .
the information remained under wraps until the western forces drove the taliban out of kabul in 2001 . the white house in washington seemed to have not known about the mineral resources until recently , when an internal memo by the us department of defense said the value of the deposits in afghanistan was about a trillion dollars .

ashraf also suggests that afghans might prefer to sell the valuable mineral resources to china or india rather than to western buyers . experts however see such a statement as an attempt by the kabul government to use afghanistan 's mineral resources as an asset and to pit the west , china and india against each other - while keeping all options open . authors : arif farahmand , cem sey / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mineral resources worth about a trillion dollars have been found in afghanistan .
these include gold , iron , cobalt and lithium . the report about the pentagon 's huge afghan mineral finds and their economic potential has attracted a lot of attention in afghanistan .
many are upbeat about it .
abdurrahman ashraf , the advisor to president hamid karzai on mining issues , says that his government will conduct an in-depth investigation to verify the information .
" we have been given data which are necessary for the mining of the resources .

after the withdrawal of the red army , afghan geologists hid the maps which their soviet colleagues had left behind .

economist sayhoon believes there could be other motives as well : " the us is warning us afghans and suggesting to us to consider exploiting and using these mineral resources .

ashraf also suggests that afghans might prefer to sell the valuable mineral resources to china or india rather than to western buyers . experts however see such a statement as an attempt by the kabul government to use afghanistan 's mineral resources as an asset and to pit the west , china and india against each other - while keeping all options open . authors : arif farahmand , cem sey / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

massive amounts of oil are still gushing out and no one , neither bp nor the us government , can do anything about it .
are you astonished that the world 's superpower and one of the biggest oil company 's ca n't stop an oil leak ?
klaus toepfer : definitely .
i am to the utmost surprised .
it is not the only exploration in these depths , there are lots of others and if there is no possibility to stop such a leak then that gives us a totally new impression about the way we produce oil offshore ..
yes , it is more than astonishing that something is licensed when you can not handle a disaster like this .
president barack obama has been harshly criticised for his crisis management with charges that he has acted too late and not strongly enough .
how would you rate obama 's handling of the crisis ?
i think this was really an unexpected development .
that he is doing his utmost right now using not only strong words against bp , but also to integrate all the capacities of the superpower goes withhout saying .
so i would n't criticise him as harshly as he has been criticised by some commentators .
but this is a normal process in an open democratic system and you must be aware of those criticisms and you have to respond to it on a daily basis .
you have to have a clear understanding of the concerns of all the people living in the area most affected by the disaster .
you obviously have to focus on the ecological disaster , but this ecological disaster is linked with huge disaster for the people living in this region who earn their living with tourism , fishing and in other industries .
this serves as an important wake-up call that we now have to hurry up and change our options for producing electricity and energy so that we do n't need to depend any longer on these kinds of risky offshore endeavors .
bp has also been criticised very sharply over its handling and communication of the crisis .
what grade would you give them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toepfer i really believe they lost the control over how to handle the crisis and failed to live up to their responsibilty .
their performance was n't good at all and i am fairly sure that this will have consequences not only within bp , of course it has to start there , but for the industry as a whole .
we have to be aware that this is not only about bp , but there are comparable situations involving others as we saw with the exxon valdez and the disasters off the european coasts .
every crisis is of course an opportunity to learn and change something .
what consequences must be drawn from this crisis now ?
the first and most important consequence is : do your utmost to further develop new energy sources with lower risks .
because if we keep relying on fossil fuels , especially oil , we must recognize that the low-hanging fruits are already harvested and that we will maneuver ourselves into more and more risky and costly situations if we continue to rely on fossil fuels .
so it is high time that we further develop renewable energy and use sun and wind and biomass , geothermal and new energy sources like wave power .
we also have to realize now that the dream that oil is cheap is finally coming to an end .
of course it is easy to point one 's finger at the obama administration and bp for their handling of the crisis .
but are we sure that something like this could n't happen on our own front door in the north sea where there are also oil platforms and drilling ?
have germany and european countries done enough so that something like that ca n't happen there ?
the probability is definitely lower in the north sea .
there are different structures how to operate and handle those risks we saw in the gulf of mexico .
but nobody can be sure that there is zero risk in the north sea and other places in the world as well .
there is a risk , but the probability is much lower .
this oil disaster ranks already as the us ' worst environmental catastrophe in history .
as the un 's former point man on the environment : how bad is this on a global scale ?
this is a problem on a global scale without any doubt .
one should n't exaggerate it , but if you see all the images and pictures one can conclude that this is not just a limited problem in one region of the world , it is a clear signal for the whole world to come to a new assessment about those kinds of drillings and about oil production in general .
it would be a grave mistake to say do n't worry this is only a problem in the gulf of mexico .
klaus toepfer is the founding director of the institute for advanced sustainability studies in potsdam .
from 1998 to 2006 he was executive director of the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- .
prior to that he served as germany 's minister for the env ironment , nature conservation and nuclear safety between 1987 and 1994 .

every crisis is of course an opportunity to learn and change something .
what consequences must be drawn from this crisis now ?
the first and most important consequence is : do your utmost to further develop new energy sources with lower risks .
because if we keep relying on fossil fuels , especially oil , we must recognize that the low-hanging fruits are already harvested and that we will maneuver ourselves into more and more risky and costly situations if we continue to rely on fossil fuels .
so it is high time that we further develop renewable energy and use sun and wind and biomass , geothermal and new energy sources like wave power .
we also have to realize now that the dream that oil is cheap is finally coming to an end .
of course it is easy to point one 's finger at the obama administration and bp for their handling of the crisis .
but are we sure that something like this could n't happen on our own front door in the north sea where there are also oil platforms and drilling ?
have germany and european countries done enough so that something like that ca n't happen there ?
the probability is definitely lower in the north sea .
there are different structures how to operate and handle those risks we saw in the gulf of mexico .
but nobody can be sure that there is zero risk in the north sea and other places in the world as well .
there is a risk , but the probability is much lower .
this oil disaster ranks already as the us ' worst environmental catastrophe in history .
as the un 's former point man on the environment : how bad is this on a global scale ?
this is a problem on a global scale without any doubt .
one should n't exaggerate it , but if you see all the images and pictures one can conclude that this is not just a limited problem in one region of the world , it is a clear signal for the whole world to come to a new assessment about those kinds of drillings and about oil production in general .
it would be a grave mistake to say do n't worry this is only a problem in the gulf of mexico .

massive amounts of oil are still gushing out and no one , neither bp nor the us government , can do anything about it .
are you astonished that the world 's superpower and one of the biggest oil company 's ca n't stop an oil leak ?
klaus toepfer : definitely .
i am to the utmost surprised .
it is not the only exploration in these depths , there are lots of others and if there is no possibility to stop such a leak then that gives us a totally new impression about the way we produce oil offshore ..
yes , it is more than astonishing that something is licensed when you can not handle a disaster like this .
president barack obama has been harshly criticised for his crisis management with charges that he has acted too late and not strongly enough .
how would you rate obama 's handling of the crisis ?
i think this was really an unexpected development .
that he is doing his utmost right now using not only strong words against bp , but also to integrate all the capacities of the superpower goes withhout saying .
so i would n't criticise him as harshly as he has been criticised by some commentators .
but this is a normal process in an open democratic system and you must be aware of those criticisms and you have to respond to it on a daily basis .
you have to have a clear understanding of the concerns of all the people living in the area most affected by the disaster .
you obviously have to focus on the ecological disaster , but this ecological disaster is linked with huge disaster for the people living in this region who earn their living with tourism , fishing and in other industries .
this serves as an important wake-up call that we now have to hurry up and change our options for producing electricity and energy so that we do n't need to depend any longer on these kinds of risky offshore endeavors .
bp has also been criticised very sharply over its handling and communication of the crisis .
what grade would you give them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toepfer i really believe they lost the control over how to handle the crisis and failed to live up to their responsibilty .
their performance was n't good at all and i am fairly sure that this will have consequences not only within bp , of course it has to start there , but for the industry as a whole .
we have to be aware that this is not only about bp , but there are comparable situations involving others as we saw with the exxon valdez and the disasters off the european coasts .

a military band played the " yorck march " as a formation of bundeswehr soldiers marched onto the park outside berlin 's bellevue palace , the official government residence .
the band also played " marsch der elisabether " by johann strauss and william handy 's " st. louis blues , " which koehler had requested .
the military ceremony is the highest in germany and performed only for the president , chancellor and defense minister .
speeches are not part of such ceremonies , but koehler was invited to a private reception at the presidential office by acting president and bremen mayor jens boehrnsen .
speaking in front of around 200 guests , koehler defended his much criticized resignation .
" i made the decision that i held - and still hold - to be right , " he said , according to a statement from the office of the president .
bildunterschrift : a military band played ' st. louis blues ' by william handy at koehler 's request koehler , 67 , resigned on may 31 after being criticized for comments he made about the appropriate use of the german military .
his replacement is to be voted in on june 30 by the federal convention , made up of the lower house of parliament and an equal number of representatives selected by the 16 state governments .

in the aftermath of german reunification in 1990 , he headed the agency that oversaw the opening of the files of the east german secret police , the stasi .

within the framework of german development work , deg is responsible for financing investments of private companies for projects in developing and transition countries .
an example from the realm of climate change is the olkaria iii geothermal plant in kenya .
wenn says that the climate change debate has been shaped by the role of the public sector .
“ the participation of the private sector has mostly been missing in public discussions until now , ” he says .
for olkaria iii , 105 million dollars -lrb- us -rrb- were provided by outside financing .

cologne-based deg , part of the kfw banking group , lead the realization of the project .
bruno wenn , chairman of the board of management at deg will present this flagship project at the deutsche welle global media forum .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
within the framework of german development work , deg is responsible for financing investments of private companies for projects in developing and transition countries .
an example from the realm of climate change is the olkaria iii geothermal plant in kenya .
wenn says that the climate change debate has been shaped by the role of the public sector .
“ the participation of the private sector has mostly been missing in public discussions until now , ” he says .
for olkaria iii , 105 million dollars -lrb- us -rrb- were provided by outside financing .
deg ’ s requirements : the project must be “ operational , profitable , environmental and socially acceptable ” .
wenn is convinced that olkaria iii can be a glowing example for making climate projects profitable .
however , he also says that the private infrastructures that exist in developing countries are a major challenge .
when working on olkaria iii , deg benefited from kfw ’ s cooperation with the state-run power company in kenya , in order to get more investors on board .
wenn states that geothermal energy isn ’ t a futuristic vision .
“ the capacity in 2008 was just behind solar energy worldwide .
there is a lot of potential in the americas and in asia , ” says wenn .
“ the usa is currently the largest consumer of geothermal energy , followed by the philippines , indonesia and mexico . ”
it could also be important in africa .
“ olkaria iii is like the core in africa for further development in the region and a big step forward . ”
in bonn , wenn will make it clear that all stakeholders must reach a “ long-term , global agreement regarding the general conditions about climate change and the prevention of future greenhouse gas emissions . ”

wenn says that the climate change debate has been shaped by the role of the public sector .
“ the participation of the private sector has mostly been missing in public discussions until now , ” he says .
for olkaria iii , 105 million dollars -lrb- us -rrb- were provided by outside financing .
deg ’ s requirements : the project must be “ operational , profitable , environmental and socially acceptable ” .
wenn is convinced that olkaria iii can be a glowing example for making climate projects profitable .
however , he also says that the private infrastructures that exist in developing countries are a major challenge .
when working on olkaria iii , deg benefited from kfw ’ s cooperation with the state-run power company in kenya , in order to get more investors on board .
wenn states that geothermal energy isn ’ t a futuristic vision .
“ the capacity in 2008 was just behind solar energy worldwide .
there is a lot of potential in the americas and in asia , ” says wenn .
“ the usa is currently the largest consumer of geothermal energy , followed by the philippines , indonesia and mexico . ”
it could also be important in africa .
“ olkaria iii is like the core in africa for further development in the region and a big step forward . ”
in bonn , wenn will make it clear that all stakeholders must reach a “ long-term , global agreement regarding the general conditions about climate change and the prevention of future greenhouse gas emissions . ”
more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 16.06.2010 new report reveals shocking state of german education system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yet another report is critical of germany 's education system one in six germans aged between 20 and 30 has no vocational qualification and is no longer in the education system .
that is the main finding of a new report presented by the german education ministry . more evidence of the desperate state of germany 's education system was revealed on wednesday , with the pre-publication of statistics from a new " education in germany " report .
according to the report , which is to be presented thursday by the german education ministry and the state conference on education , an assembly of germany 's state education ministers , 17 percent of young germans aged between 20 and 30 have no vocational qualification and are no longer in the education system .
this marks a new high - in 2007 , the figure was still at 15.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezdemir is convinced the problems are endemic the situation is particularly dire among young people with an immigrant background , 30 percent of whom have no formal training and no prospect of achieving further qualifications .
in the face of increasing pressures in the job market , the researchers warned that germany could be facing a long-term unemployment problem for those without formal qualifications .
one forecast predicts that the supply of unqualified workers would exceed the number of jobs in this sector by some 1.3 million for the next 15 years .
for cem oezdemir , education spokesman for the green party , the deficits in germany 's system are appalling .
" we 're talking about a sort of risk-group that leaves school lacking basic reading , writing and arithmetic skills - they are functionally illiterate , " he told deutsche welle .
no surprises problems have been endemic for years , and the report 's findings provide few surprises for those concerned with german education .
stephanie odenwald , director for vocational training at the educational workers ' union gew , said , " it 's not a surprise - everyone who knows the education system has known this problem for years . "
odenwald can also identify one of the main causes of the problem : " it is mainly the fault of the misguided development of this massive transitional system , where young people leave school and do n't get into job training programs and instead get put into these waiting loops , or ' job preparation schemes ' as they are known .
there is a very wide body of opinion that says we need to get rid of this system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with an immigrant background are particularly disadvantaged this transitional system has often been blamed for leaving many of germany 's young people in limbo after leaving school , but oezdemir says that the problems are much deeper .
" what this study makes clear is that we need to question our whole education system - from kindergarten all the way to university , " he said .
" the interim system is just one element of it . "
the sacred cow gymnasium the new report is one of many that have indirectly brought attention to the injustices in germany 's three-tiered school system , which divides students according to ability into one of three different schools after the fourth grade - these are the hauptschule , the realschule and the elite gymnasium .
international comparisons like the pisa studies have highlighted the social inequalities that are caused by this system .
the report shows that hauptschule students continue to have problems finding job training places , even though the competition for them is said to be decreasing .
as far as oezdemir is concerned , germany 's conservative government resists reform because it is clinging to the gymnasium .
" there really is n't a recognition problem , " he says .
" these studies always come out with similar results .
there is an application problem .
we know the problems , but the politicians get bogged down in financial questions , and the taboo of the gymnasium .
the schools need to fit our children , not the other way round . "

that is the main finding of a new report presented by the german education ministry . more evidence of the desperate state of germany 's education system was revealed on wednesday , with the pre-publication of statistics from a new " education in germany " report .
according to the report , which is to be presented thursday by the german education ministry and the state conference on education , an assembly of germany 's state education ministers , 17 percent of young germans aged between 20 and 30 have no vocational qualification and are no longer in the education system .
this marks a new high - in 2007 , the figure was still at 15.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezdemir is convinced the problems are endemic the situation is particularly dire among young people with an immigrant background , 30 percent of whom have no formal training and no prospect of achieving further qualifications .
in the face of increasing pressures in the job market , the researchers warned that germany could be facing a long-term unemployment problem for those without formal qualifications .
one forecast predicts that the supply of unqualified workers would exceed the number of jobs in this sector by some 1.3 million for the next 15 years .
for cem oezdemir , education spokesman for the green party , the deficits in germany 's system are appalling .
" we 're talking about a sort of risk-group that leaves school lacking basic reading , writing and arithmetic skills - they are functionally illiterate , " he told deutsche welle .
no surprises problems have been endemic for years , and the report 's findings provide few surprises for those concerned with german education .
stephanie odenwald , director for vocational training at the educational workers ' union gew , said , " it 's not a surprise - everyone who knows the education system has known this problem for years . "
odenwald can also identify one of the main causes of the problem : " it is mainly the fault of the misguided development of this massive transitional system , where young people leave school and do n't get into job training programs and instead get put into these waiting loops , or ' job preparation schemes ' as they are known .
there is a very wide body of opinion that says we need to get rid of this system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with an immigrant background are particularly disadvantaged this transitional system has often been blamed for leaving many of germany 's young people in limbo after leaving school , but oezdemir says that the problems are much deeper .
" what this study makes clear is that we need to question our whole education system - from kindergarten all the way to university , " he said .
" the interim system is just one element of it . "
the sacred cow gymnasium the new report is one of many that have indirectly brought attention to the injustices in germany 's three-tiered school system , which divides students according to ability into one of three different schools after the fourth grade - these are the hauptschule , the realschule and the elite gymnasium .
international comparisons like the pisa studies have highlighted the social inequalities that are caused by this system .
the report shows that hauptschule students continue to have problems finding job training places , even though the competition for them is said to be decreasing .
as far as oezdemir is concerned , germany 's conservative government resists reform because it is clinging to the gymnasium .
" there really is n't a recognition problem , " he says .
" these studies always come out with similar results .
there is an application problem .
we know the problems , but the politicians get bogged down in financial questions , and the taboo of the gymnasium .
the schools need to fit our children , not the other way round . "

now , according to india 's official press information bureau , afghanistan has invited india to invest in its mining sector , particularly in mining iron ore , copper , gold and coal . during a visit to india on tuesday , afghanistan 's mines minister wahidullah shahrani also sought india 's know-how in the field of mineral exploration .
he also said that afghanistan will launch a road show in london on june 25 , in which about 200 companies from across the globe will be invited to showcase their mining and exploration potential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's mines minister wahidullah shahrani india needs minerals and metals experts say resource-hungry india is not likely to forgo any opportunity to extract afghanistan 's untapped valuable mineral deposits , which also include lithium , a key material used in a wide range of consumer products . " india is an expanding economy and our requirements for different types of minerals will go up , " says santosh kumar , a former indian diplomat in new delhi .
" india is among the leading technological countries in the world .
and in those technologies like for example aerospace and so on , there are new metals and new applications for these metals required .
since we do n't have these metals and rare earths in india , some of them we import , so obviously any discoveries in our neighborhood would be of interest to us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign secretary nirupama rao visits the indian embassy in kabul following a suicide attack in 2009 security is a challenge but expert kumar also points out that indian companies working in the field have some serious concerns : " for them , there are two problems .
one is the security situation .
the second is that these minerals are found in parts which are not well connected .
so transport is a critical issue . " following the attacks that killed seven indians in kabul earlier this year , new delhi has often expressed worries over the security of its nationals in afghanistan . many observers in the us also believe that security problems , weak infrastructure and corruption will be a hindrance for digging up the mineral riches .
there are also concerns that the taliban could intensify their campaign now that they know that afghanistan is sitting on a goldmine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chinese delegation visiting the site of a copper mine in aynak in 2007 china and pakistan but given the scale of afghanistan 's mineral wealth , many may not hesitate to take a risk .
be it the americans themselves or the chinese , who have already invested in the vast aynak copper mine , south of kabul .
ye hailin , an expert from the chinese academy of social sciences , is cautious though .
" why would you connect this news with china ?
the us is the major player in afghanistan .
one should ask , what sort of new strategy can the united states plan now . " and what about afghanistan 's immediate neighbor pakistan ?
shahid kardar , a pakistani economist , believes that pakistan would rather be interested in providing logistical support than going for full-fledged investment . " i do n't think we will ever be in a position to be a serious investor .

the artist talked with deutsche welle about some of the big ideas behind them . contemporary installation artist christo turns 75 this week , less than a year after the loss of his wife and artistic partner jeanne-claude .
deutsche welle spoke with christo about how he is moving forward with his work and what he thinks about its reception .
two museums in germany - the kunsthalle wuerth and the max ernst museum in bruehl - are currently displaying some of his works .
deutsche welle : you had such a symbiotic relationship with jeanne-claude .
how is it for you to continue work now on the projects you had planned together ?
christo : we always knew that one of us would be the first to go , and we 've known that for almost the last 50 years .
ever since we met in 1958 , we 've always traveled in separate planes so that one of us would be able to finish the work we started .
so , everything was in some way already prepared .
these projects take so long to get permission and to realize that we always envisioned this was possible .
many people struggle to understand the concept that you do n't work for money .
what does it say about our society that people have so much trouble grasping that you do art simply to create new art ?

i also produce a variety of tangible goods to create the funds necessary to build projects that can not be bought and can not be owned - even jeanne-claude and i do n't own them .
the projects are about freedom .
freedom is the enemy of possession , and possession is equal to permanence .
you know , humans like to be in the presence of things that are unique like they are - things that wo n't happen again .
the projects have a quality of fragility and tenderness , like our own lives or our own childhood .
they can not be substituted or repeated .

i would never think about that myself .
we like to build these projects because we enjoy it for ourselves , like any true artist .

these projects deal with a very wide variety of aesthetic dimensions .
a 3-d work of art is different from a painting with a flat surface .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 16.06.2010 newer crop varieties could check world hunger but meet with resistance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nerica rice can thrive in drought-prone environments drought-prone regions of africa are likely to be hard-hit as climate change continues .
although food is already in short supply there , local farmers are reluctant to plant new crop varieties that promise better yields . in drought-prone regions of africa , people are often bitterly poor and food is scarce .
unfortunately , the inhabitants of those regions are the very people who , experts say , will be the first to suffer the consequences of climate change .
while droughts used to occur in eastern africa every seven years , they now occur almost every other year .
this negatively impacts food output in the region .
one organization working to improve food security in africa is the coalition for african rice development , which wants to drastically reduce the continent 's reliance on expensive rice imports .
it hopes to develop resilient new rice varieties and distribute them to smallholder farmers , thereby doubling rice production to 28 million tons per annum by the year 2018 .
however , not all farmers are willing to plant modified seeds , whether they be rice , maize or any another crop .
farmers resist change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smallholder maize farms in africa are suffering from less rainfall and higher temperatures christina sabini runs a small farm near morogoro , tanzania with her husband , and says less rain and more heat have reduced harvests during recent years .
like other farmers in the region , sabini says she has no choice but to adapt to the changing climate .
last year , she was offered new tan250 maize seeds , which were researched and tested in kenya and zimbabwe .
" these seeds are better because they also survive droughts , and they do provide good yields .
even without using fertilizer , i can reap good maize , " she said .
sabini was one of the few regional farmers who chose to accept the seeds , and she believes she made the right decision .
others were more conservative and continued using the traditional varieties .
according to cynthia awuor , a climate expert with the non-governmental organization care in kenya , developing drought-resistant seeds is only half the challenge faced by those whose want to curb world hunger by increasing crop yields .
convincing farmers to voluntarily change their habits and plant the new seeds can be very difficult .
" there 's much more exploration into drought tolerant species of maize as well as other crops .
at the same time , we are trying to promote crop varieties and seed varieties that were traditionally drought tolerant .
so we 're encouraging farmers to go into planting more and more sorghum , for example , and cassava , which are traditionally drought tolerant types of crops , " awuor told deutsche welle .
modified crops are slow to catch on but awuor and her organization are not the first to encounter resistance to modified crop varieties .
in the 1990 's , scientists cross bred a high-yield variety of asian rice with a stress-resistant african one .
the result was nerica , tough and locally adapted rice best suited for the highland or dry land environments which account for about 70 percent of africa 's rice farms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased food production may save lives as climate change progresses many farmers have been able to double their harvests , thanks to the new rice , but nerica did n't catch on until more than 80 varieties and thousands of lines were developed to cater to regions in 20 african countries .
thomas yanga works for the united nation 's world food program , where he is responsible for west africa .
he is well aware of the attitudes of farmers in his home country of cameroon .
" i know from my own village that the people are very , very attached to the taste of certain commodities .
and for them the taste is more important than anything else .
any new variety that does not give them the same taste , they will reject , " he told deutsche welle .
monty jones from sierra leone was awarded the world food prize six years ago for his role in developing nerica .
while he is proud of the rich harvest reaped from the new rice variety , he is worried about the impact of climate change in the future .
" at a certain level of distress – whether it 's drought , whether it 's flooding , whether it 's salinity – every material will break down .
basically , what we can do is to increase the level of resistance or tolerance to these problems , " he told deutsche welle .

although food is already in short supply there , local farmers are reluctant to plant new crop varieties that promise better yields . in drought-prone regions of africa , people are often bitterly poor and food is scarce .
unfortunately , the inhabitants of those regions are the very people who , experts say , will be the first to suffer the consequences of climate change .
while droughts used to occur in eastern africa every seven years , they now occur almost every other year .
this negatively impacts food output in the region .
one organization working to improve food security in africa is the coalition for african rice development , which wants to drastically reduce the continent 's reliance on expensive rice imports .
it hopes to develop resilient new rice varieties and distribute them to smallholder farmers , thereby doubling rice production to 28 million tons per annum by the year 2018 .
however , not all farmers are willing to plant modified seeds , whether they be rice , maize or any another crop .
farmers resist change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smallholder maize farms in africa are suffering from less rainfall and higher temperatures christina sabini runs a small farm near morogoro , tanzania with her husband , and says less rain and more heat have reduced harvests during recent years .
like other farmers in the region , sabini says she has no choice but to adapt to the changing climate .
last year , she was offered new tan250 maize seeds , which were researched and tested in kenya and zimbabwe .
" these seeds are better because they also survive droughts , and they do provide good yields .
even without using fertilizer , i can reap good maize , " she said .
sabini was one of the few regional farmers who chose to accept the seeds , and she believes she made the right decision .
others were more conservative and continued using the traditional varieties .
according to cynthia awuor , a climate expert with the non-governmental organization care in kenya , developing drought-resistant seeds is only half the challenge faced by those whose want to curb world hunger by increasing crop yields .
convincing farmers to voluntarily change their habits and plant the new seeds can be very difficult .
" there 's much more exploration into drought tolerant species of maize as well as other crops .
at the same time , we are trying to promote crop varieties and seed varieties that were traditionally drought tolerant .
so we 're encouraging farmers to go into planting more and more sorghum , for example , and cassava , which are traditionally drought tolerant types of crops , " awuor told deutsche welle .
modified crops are slow to catch on but awuor and her organization are not the first to encounter resistance to modified crop varieties .
in the 1990 's , scientists cross bred a high-yield variety of asian rice with a stress-resistant african one .
the result was nerica , tough and locally adapted rice best suited for the highland or dry land environments which account for about 70 percent of africa 's rice farms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased food production may save lives as climate change progresses many farmers have been able to double their harvests , thanks to the new rice , but nerica did n't catch on until more than 80 varieties and thousands of lines were developed to cater to regions in 20 african countries .
thomas yanga works for the united nation 's world food program , where he is responsible for west africa .
he is well aware of the attitudes of farmers in his home country of cameroon .
" i know from my own village that the people are very , very attached to the taste of certain commodities .
and for them the taste is more important than anything else .
any new variety that does not give them the same taste , they will reject , " he told deutsche welle .
monty jones from sierra leone was awarded the world food prize six years ago for his role in developing nerica .
while he is proud of the rich harvest reaped from the new rice variety , he is worried about the impact of climate change in the future .
" at a certain level of distress – whether it 's drought , whether it 's flooding , whether it 's salinity – every material will break down .
basically , what we can do is to increase the level of resistance or tolerance to these problems , " he told deutsche welle .

many thousands of refugees are fleeing the ethnic clashes , with the united nations warning of a possible humanitarian catastrophe . ethnic groups in kyrgyzstan clashed again in overnight battles as the official death toll in the country rose to at least 179 , according to a report by the kyrgyz news agency akipress , quoting the health ministry . the ministry said that it expected the actual number of dead to be much higher . troops were patrolling streets in the city of osh on wednesday morning , following clashes between kyrgyz groups and the uzbek minority .
the number of civilians forced to flee the violence is now put at 275,000 according to the united nations high commission for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- . united nations children 's fund unicef reports that women , children and the elderly make up more than 90 percent of the refugees .
the situation was growing increasingly serious , the head of the unhcr said on wednesday . " what is happening is already a tragedy and it could become a catastrophe . "
antonio guterres said during a visit to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic uzbeks have been gathering near the kyrgyz-uzbek border " we urgently need to find a political solution ... the country 's neighbors and the international community must do everything in their power to help the interim kyrgyz government restore peace and stability , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
officials in kyrgyzstan have warned that the ethnic conflict could spread to the country 's north and neighboring countries as aid agencies attempt to cope with the humanitarian crisis in the central asian country .
some 2,000 people have been wounded in the fighting which erupted last thursday , according to official figures .
violence in the southern cities of osh and jalalabad has raised fears over the future stability of the country of 5.3 million , where uzbeks make up 14 percent of the population .
aid groups working overtime uzbekistan has been struggling to deal with a flood of ethnic refugees who crossed the border to escape the unrest .
with around 75,000 refugees already inside uzbekistan after fleeing the southern cities , authorities said they had closed off the border to prevent that number from swelling .
however the office of the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , which has been working to get relief supplies into the central asian countries , told deutsche welle it understood the border has now been reopened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations high commissioner for refugees , antonio guterres , warned of catastrophe " we have this understanding that the border is open .
we understand that yesterday it was closed temporarily for the night and now it is open , " says unhcr spokesperson babar baloch .
" the un high commissioner here in geneva , antonio guterres , has welcomed the uzbek authorities ' decision to open the border and welcome refugees who are seeking asylum in uzbekistan . "
baloch says that the unhcr plans to send six relief planes in total with 240 metric tons of supplies to uzbekistan in the coming days .
he said this would be followed by more aid once the unhcr had established a presence on the ground .
baloch added that the unhcr had been experiencing problems in reaching displaced peoples in areas around osh because of the security situation .
" we had hoped to be able to reach those people .
we have some stocks on the ground at the unhcr warehouse there in osh and we already have been in touch with the icrc -lrb- international committee of the red cross -rrb- to distribute the items we have there , but we understand and we are concerned at the poor security situation in osh and jalalabad and other areas which is impeding aid delivery . "
bildunterschrift : bodies litter the street as houses burn in jalabad military intervention meanwhile , roza otunbayeva , the interim president of kyrgyzstan , said on tuesday that there was no reason for russia to intervene by deploying peacekeepers to the crisis region .
she said the clashes were beginning to wane and that she hoped that her country 's own forces could get the situation under control .
moscow says it considers the violence in southern kyrgyzstan an internal matter for that country and has only sent several hundred troops to defend a russian military base in kyrgyzstan .
both russia and the united states have military installations in the central asian country , with the us using the strategic position as a hub to support its forces in afghanistan .
otunbayeva also said a planned constitutional referendum would go ahead on june 27 .
she was speaking at a press conference after the eu had warned that the violent clashes threatened to derail the country 's reform process .
however this view is not shared by icrc head of operations for central asia and eastern europe , pascale meige wagner , who warned " we 're far from seeing the end of this crisis . "
" we hear extremely worrying stories about people targeted - there is a will to harm and kill in kyrgzystan . "

many thousands of refugees are fleeing the ethnic clashes , with the united nations warning of a possible humanitarian catastrophe . ethnic groups in kyrgyzstan clashed again in overnight battles as the official death toll in the country rose to at least 179 , according to a report by the kyrgyz news agency akipress , quoting the health ministry . the ministry said that it expected the actual number of dead to be much higher . troops were patrolling streets in the city of osh on wednesday morning , following clashes between kyrgyz groups and the uzbek minority .
the number of civilians forced to flee the violence is now put at 275,000 according to the united nations high commission for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- . united nations children 's fund unicef reports that women , children and the elderly make up more than 90 percent of the refugees .
the situation was growing increasingly serious , the head of the unhcr said on wednesday . " what is happening is already a tragedy and it could become a catastrophe . "
antonio guterres said during a visit to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic uzbeks have been gathering near the kyrgyz-uzbek border " we urgently need to find a political solution ... the country 's neighbors and the international community must do everything in their power to help the interim kyrgyz government restore peace and stability , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
officials in kyrgyzstan have warned that the ethnic conflict could spread to the country 's north and neighboring countries as aid agencies attempt to cope with the humanitarian crisis in the central asian country .
some 2,000 people have been wounded in the fighting which erupted last thursday , according to official figures .
violence in the southern cities of osh and jalalabad has raised fears over the future stability of the country of 5.3 million , where uzbeks make up 14 percent of the population .
aid groups working overtime uzbekistan has been struggling to deal with a flood of ethnic refugees who crossed the border to escape the unrest .
with around 75,000 refugees already inside uzbekistan after fleeing the southern cities , authorities said they had closed off the border to prevent that number from swelling .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations high commissioner for refugees , antonio guterres , warned of catastrophe " we have this understanding that the border is open .
we understand that yesterday it was closed temporarily for the night and now it is open , " says unhcr spokesperson babar baloch .
" the un high commissioner here in geneva , antonio guterres , has welcomed the uzbek authorities ' decision to open the border and welcome refugees who are seeking asylum in uzbekistan . "
baloch says that the unhcr plans to send six relief planes in total with 240 metric tons of supplies to uzbekistan in the coming days .
he said this would be followed by more aid once the unhcr had established a presence on the ground .
baloch added that the unhcr had been experiencing problems in reaching displaced peoples in areas around osh because of the security situation .
" we had hoped to be able to reach those people .
we have some stocks on the ground at the unhcr warehouse there in osh and we already have been in touch with the icrc -lrb- international committee of the red cross -rrb- to distribute the items we have there , but we understand and we are concerned at the poor security situation in osh and jalalabad and other areas which is impeding aid delivery .

she said the clashes were beginning to wane and that she hoped that her country 's own forces could get the situation under control .
moscow says it considers the violence in southern kyrgyzstan an internal matter for that country and has only sent several hundred troops to defend a russian military base in kyrgyzstan .
both russia and the united states have military installations in the central asian country , with the us using the strategic position as a hub to support its forces in afghanistan .
otunbayeva also said a planned constitutional referendum would go ahead on june 27 .
she was speaking at a press conference after the eu had warned that the violent clashes threatened to derail the country 's reform process .
however this view is not shared by icrc head of operations for central asia and eastern europe , pascale meige wagner , who warned " we 're far from seeing the end of this crisis . "
" we hear extremely worrying stories about people targeted - there is a will to harm and kill in kyrgzystan . "

we have some stocks on the ground at the unhcr warehouse there in osh and we already have been in touch with the icrc -lrb- international committee of the red cross -rrb- to distribute the items we have there , but we understand and we are concerned at the poor security situation in osh and jalalabad and other areas which is impeding aid delivery . "
bildunterschrift : bodies litter the street as houses burn in jalabad military intervention meanwhile , roza otunbayeva , the interim president of kyrgyzstan , said on tuesday that there was no reason for russia to intervene by deploying peacekeepers to the crisis region .
she said the clashes were beginning to wane and that she hoped that her country 's own forces could get the situation under control .
moscow says it considers the violence in southern kyrgyzstan an internal matter for that country and has only sent several hundred troops to defend a russian military base in kyrgyzstan .
both russia and the united states have military installations in the central asian country , with the us using the strategic position as a hub to support its forces in afghanistan .
otunbayeva also said a planned constitutional referendum would go ahead on june 27 .
she was speaking at a press conference after the eu had warned that the violent clashes threatened to derail the country 's reform process .
however this view is not shared by icrc head of operations for central asia and eastern europe , pascale meige wagner , who warned " we 're far from seeing the end of this crisis . "
" we hear extremely worrying stories about people targeted - there is a will to harm and kill in kyrgzystan . "

that ’ s what i want . "
in order to accomplish that , he 's ditched the idea of singing in german with the view that english songs fare better internationally than german ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today the clubs , tomorrow the stadiums ?
the five year plan abel & cain are n't dreaming of success ; as far as the four guys from düsseldorf are concerned , they 're already convinced it 's going to happen and that this is the right time .
at the moment , they 're all working flat out towards this goal so much so that chris knows exactly where he sees the band in five years ' time .
" i want to see the music we make mature and to see it develop into something round and perfect , " he adds , " i can picture way more live shows , touring our third album . i can really see us doing well in this business .
in fact , i can ’ t imagine anything else . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : oil spill in the gulf of mexico the oil disaster the world prefers to ignore americans vent anger over oil spill differently from europeans obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist full oil spill compensation looks increasingly unlikely disasters -pipe- 16.06.2010 bp oil spill must have global consequences , says former un expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neither bp nor the us government has been able to plug the leak in an interview with deutsche welle , the former director of the un 's environment program expresses his astonishment that the oil leak ca n't be stopped and demands consequences both at bp and beyond . deutsche welle : weeks after the explosion of the oil rig in the gulf of mexico it seems there is hardly any progress being made .
massive amounts of oil are still gushing out and no one , neither bp nor the us government , can do anything about it .
are you astonished that the world 's superpower and one of the biggest oil company 's ca n't stop an oil leak ?
klaus toepfer : definitely .
i am to the utmost surprised .
it is not the only exploration in these depths , there are lots of others and if there is no possibility to stop such a leak then that gives us a totally new impression about the way we produce oil offshore ..
yes , it is more than astonishing that something is licensed when you can not handle a disaster like this .
president barack obama has been harshly criticised for his crisis management with charges that he has acted too late and not strongly enough .
how would you rate obama 's handling of the crisis ?
i think this was really an unexpected development .
that he is doing his utmost right now using not only strong words against bp , but also to integrate all the capacities of the superpower goes withhout saying .
so i would n't criticise him as harshly as he has been criticised by some commentators .
but this is a normal process in an open democratic system and you must be aware of those criticisms and you have to respond to it on a daily basis .
you have to have a clear understanding of the concerns of all the people living in the area most affected by the disaster .
you obviously have to focus on the ecological disaster , but this ecological disaster is linked with huge disaster for the people living in this region who earn their living with tourism , fishing and in other industries .
this serves as an important wake-up call that we now have to hurry up and change our options for producing electricity and energy so that we do n't need to depend any longer on these kinds of risky offshore endeavors .
bp has also been criticised very sharply over its handling and communication of the crisis .
what grade would you give them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toepfer i really believe they lost the control over how to handle the crisis and failed to live up to their responsibilty .
their performance was n't good at all and i am fairly sure that this will have consequences not only within bp , of course it has to start there , but for the industry as a whole .
we have to be aware that this is not only about bp , but there are comparable situations involving others as we saw with the exxon valdez and the disasters off the european coasts .
every crisis is of course an opportunity to learn and change something .
what consequences must be drawn from this crisis now ?
the first and most important consequence is : do your utmost to further develop new energy sources with lower risks .
because if we keep relying on fossil fuels , especially oil , we must recognize that the low-hanging fruits are already harvested and that we will maneuver ourselves into more and more risky and costly situations if we continue to rely on fossil fuels .
so it is high time that we further develop renewable energy and use sun and wind and biomass , geothermal and new energy sources like wave power .
we also have to realize now that the dream that oil is cheap is finally coming to an end .
of course it is easy to point one 's finger at the obama administration and bp for their handling of the crisis .
but are we sure that something like this could n't happen on our own front door in the north sea where there are also oil platforms and drilling ?
have germany and european countries done enough so that something like that ca n't happen there ?
the probability is definitely lower in the north sea .
there are different structures how to operate and handle those risks we saw in the gulf of mexico .
but nobody can be sure that there is zero risk in the north sea and other places in the world as well .
there is a risk , but the probability is much lower .
this oil disaster ranks already as the us ' worst environmental catastrophe in history .
as the un 's former point man on the environment : how bad is this on a global scale ?
this is a problem on a global scale without any doubt .
one should n't exaggerate it , but if you see all the images and pictures one can conclude that this is not just a limited problem in one region of the world , it is a clear signal for the whole world to come to a new assessment about those kinds of drillings and about oil production in general .
it would be a grave mistake to say do n't worry this is only a problem in the gulf of mexico .
klaus toepfer is the founding director of the institute for advanced sustainability studies in potsdam .
from 1998 to 2006 he was executive director of the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- .
prior to that he served as germany 's minister for the env ironment , nature conservation and nuclear safety between 1987 and 1994 .

dw-world.de obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist us president obama has televised his tough stance against bp as oil continues to leak into the gulf of mexico .
but it 's unclear what legal mechanisms he can use to force the company to pay full compensation .
-lrb- 16.06.2010 -rrb- americans vent anger over oil spill differently than europeans compared to earlier oil disasters in europe where thousands took to the streets , the outcry in the us over the bp spill seems rather restrained .
but the lack of mass rallies should n't be seen as a lack of public anger .

earlier , in group h , switzerland shocked spain 1-0 , while chile overcame honduras by the same score line . uruguay have beaten south africa 3-0 in the second round of group a games at the world cup , pushing the south americans up to four points and leaving bafana bafana languishing on one point .
south africa started the game with energy and tight passing , taking it to the uruguayan defense .
however the dominant possession did n't pay dividends for the hosts , when uruguay scored in the 23rd minute through a looping shot from outside the box by atletico madrid striker diego forlan .
the ball tucked under the crossbar and into the back of the net , leaving south african keeper itumeleng khune helpless .
the goal did n't have a huge impact on south africa 's composure , but from that point onwards the possession balanced out and uruguay was allowed more time in their attacking third .
uruguay started the second half a different team , keeping the south african defense under pressure for the opening 15 minutes .
south africa seemed somewhat lackluster with the ball and were unable to threaten their opponent 's goal until the 65th minute after a cross from the right by siboniso gaxa to the near post met katlego mphela 's head , though the forward pushed the ball wide .
the death knell for south africa came in the 76th minute when khune was red carded for bringing down ajax striker luis suarez in the box after he was clear on goal .
forlan coolly smashed home the resultant penalty kick .
uruguay made it 3-0 with a close-range header from alvaro pereira deep in injury time from a suarez cross .
south africa must now hope for a win next tuesday against france if they are to have any hope of progressing to the round of 16 .
shock in nelspruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland upset spain , who were title favorites in wednesday 's afternoon match , european title holders spain were toppled in their first world cup match after going down 1-0 in a shock loss to ottmar hitzfeld ’ s switzerland .
the swiss took the lead in the 52nd minute through a scrappy goal against the run of play from gelson fernandes , who picked up a loose ball after spanish keeper iker casillas collided with eren derdiyok in the box .
xavi alonso went closest to equalizing for the spaniards in the 70th minute when his shot from the edge of the box rebounded off the crossbar .
switzerland nearly went 2-0 up four minutes later when derdiyok weaved past two men in the box and struck the right post after a deft shot with the outside of his right boot .
the victory is the first for switzerland over spain in 19 meetings and represents by far the greatest upset so far in the world cup in south africa .
spain dominated possession in the first 45 minutes , getting most of their team behind the ball .
the best chance fell to gerard pique , who cut back inside swiss defender stephane grichting but saw his shot rebound off the legs of keeper diego benaglio .
despite showing sparks of brilliance with the ball , spain rarely threatened during the half , while switzerland , too , lacked any real scoring opportunities .
vicente del bosque 's spain , which , going into the tournament , was among the teams most favored to lift the world cup , were expected to come away with all three points against switzerland .
victory after 48 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beausejour -lrb- in red -rrb- shoots to score past honduras goalkeeper noel valladares in the day 's opening group h match , chile ended a 48-year winless streak in the world cup by overcoming honduras 1-0 at mbombela stadium in nelspruit .
striker jean beausejour bagged the only goal of the game .
in a game which it dominated , chile were unlucky not to extend their lead after man-of-the-match beausejour 's 34th minute strike .
the goal followed some slick passing in the honduran box which created space for mauricio isla on the right flank to get a low cross in at the near post , which was turned in by the mexico-based beausejour .
chile defender waldo ponce came forward for a free kick midway through the second half and should have doubled the lead only for veteran goalie noel valladares to parry away a diving point-blank header .
midfielder jorge valdivia had another chance at the goal 15 minutes from full-time , but was correctly flagged offside as the " killer " second goal continued to elude chile .

earlier , in group h , switzerland shocked spain 1-0 , while chile overcame honduras by the same score line . uruguay have beaten south africa 3-0 in the second round of group a games at the world cup , pushing the south americans up to four points and leaving bafana bafana languishing on one point .
south africa started the game with energy and tight passing , taking it to the uruguayan defense .
however the dominant possession did n't pay dividends for the hosts , when uruguay scored in the 23rd minute through a looping shot from outside the box by atletico madrid striker diego forlan .
the ball tucked under the crossbar and into the back of the net , leaving south african keeper itumeleng khune helpless .
the goal did n't have a huge impact on south africa 's composure , but from that point onwards the possession balanced out and uruguay was allowed more time in their attacking third .
uruguay started the second half a different team , keeping the south african defense under pressure for the opening 15 minutes .
south africa seemed somewhat lackluster with the ball and were unable to threaten their opponent 's goal until the 65th minute after a cross from the right by siboniso gaxa to the near post met katlego mphela 's head , though the forward pushed the ball wide .
the death knell for south africa came in the 76th minute when khune was red carded for bringing down ajax striker luis suarez in the box after he was clear on goal .
forlan coolly smashed home the resultant penalty kick .
uruguay made it 3-0 with a close-range header from alvaro pereira deep in injury time from a suarez cross .
south africa must now hope for a win next tuesday against france if they are to have any hope of progressing to the round of 16 .
shock in nelspruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland upset spain , who were title favorites in wednesday 's afternoon match , european title holders spain were toppled in their first world cup match after going down 1-0 in a shock loss to ottmar hitzfeld ’ s switzerland .
the swiss took the lead in the 52nd minute through a scrappy goal against the run of play from gelson fernandes , who picked up a loose ball after spanish keeper iker casillas collided with eren derdiyok in the box .
xavi alonso went closest to equalizing for the spaniards in the 70th minute when his shot from the edge of the box rebounded off the crossbar .
switzerland nearly went 2-0 up four minutes later when derdiyok weaved past two men in the box and struck the right post after a deft shot with the outside of his right boot .
the victory is the first for switzerland over spain in 19 meetings and represents by far the greatest upset so far in the world cup in south africa .
spain dominated possession in the first 45 minutes , getting most of their team behind the ball .
the best chance fell to gerard pique , who cut back inside swiss defender stephane grichting but saw his shot rebound off the legs of keeper diego benaglio .
despite showing sparks of brilliance with the ball , spain rarely threatened during the half , while switzerland , too , lacked any real scoring opportunities .

massive amounts of oil are still gushing out and no one , neither bp nor the us government , can do anything about it .
are you astonished that the world 's superpower and one of the biggest oil company 's ca n't stop an oil leak ?
klaus toepfer : definitely .
i am to the utmost surprised .
it is not the only exploration in these depths , there are lots of others and if there is no possibility to stop such a leak then that gives us a totally new impression about the way we produce oil offshore ..
yes , it is more than astonishing that something is licensed when you can not handle a disaster like this .
president barack obama has been harshly criticised for his crisis management with charges that he has acted too late and not strongly enough .
how would you rate obama 's handling of the crisis ?
i think this was really an unexpected development .
that he is doing his utmost right now using not only strong words against bp , but also to integrate all the capacities of the superpower goes withhout saying .
so i would n't criticise him as harshly as he has been criticised by some commentators .
but this is a normal process in an open democratic system and you must be aware of those criticisms and you have to respond to it on a daily basis .
you have to have a clear understanding of the concerns of all the people living in the area most affected by the disaster .
you obviously have to focus on the ecological disaster , but this ecological disaster is linked with huge disaster for the people living in this region who earn their living with tourism , fishing and in other industries .
this serves as an important wake-up call that we now have to hurry up and change our options for producing electricity and energy so that we do n't need to depend any longer on these kinds of risky offshore endeavors .
bp has also been criticised very sharply over its handling and communication of the crisis .
what grade would you give them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toepfer i really believe they lost the control over how to handle the crisis and failed to live up to their responsibilty .
their performance was n't good at all and i am fairly sure that this will have consequences not only within bp , of course it has to start there , but for the industry as a whole .
we have to be aware that this is not only about bp , but there are comparable situations involving others as we saw with the exxon valdez and the disasters off the european coasts .
every crisis is of course an opportunity to learn and change something .
what consequences must be drawn from this crisis now ?
the first and most important consequence is : do your utmost to further develop new energy sources with lower risks .
because if we keep relying on fossil fuels , especially oil , we must recognize that the low-hanging fruits are already harvested and that we will maneuver ourselves into more and more risky and costly situations if we continue to rely on fossil fuels .
so it is high time that we further develop renewable energy and use sun and wind and biomass , geothermal and new energy sources like wave power .
we also have to realize now that the dream that oil is cheap is finally coming to an end .
of course it is easy to point one 's finger at the obama administration and bp for their handling of the crisis .
but are we sure that something like this could n't happen on our own front door in the north sea where there are also oil platforms and drilling ?
have germany and european countries done enough so that something like that ca n't happen there ?
the probability is definitely lower in the north sea .
there are different structures how to operate and handle those risks we saw in the gulf of mexico .
but nobody can be sure that there is zero risk in the north sea and other places in the world as well .
there is a risk , but the probability is much lower .
this oil disaster ranks already as the us ' worst environmental catastrophe in history .
as the un 's former point man on the environment : how bad is this on a global scale ?
this is a problem on a global scale without any doubt .
one should n't exaggerate it , but if you see all the images and pictures one can conclude that this is not just a limited problem in one region of the world , it is a clear signal for the whole world to come to a new assessment about those kinds of drillings and about oil production in general .
it would be a grave mistake to say do n't worry this is only a problem in the gulf of mexico .
klaus toepfer is the founding director of the institute for advanced sustainability studies in potsdam .
from 1998 to 2006 he was executive director of the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- .
prior to that he served as germany 's minister for the env ironment , nature conservation and nuclear safety between 1987 and 1994 .

many thousands of refugees are fleeing the ethnic clashes , with the united nations warning of a possible humanitarian catastrophe . ethnic groups in kyrgyzstan clashed again in overnight battles as the official death toll in the country rose to at least 179 , according to a report by the kyrgyz news agency akipress , quoting the health ministry . the ministry said that it expected the actual number of dead to be much higher . troops were patrolling streets in the city of osh on wednesday morning , following clashes between kyrgyz groups and the uzbek minority .
the number of civilians forced to flee the violence is now put at 275,000 according to the united nations high commission for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- . united nations children 's fund unicef reports that women , children and the elderly make up more than 90 percent of the refugees .
the situation was growing increasingly serious , the head of the unhcr said on wednesday . " what is happening is already a tragedy and it could become a catastrophe . "
antonio guterres said during a visit to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic uzbeks have been gathering near the kyrgyz-uzbek border " we urgently need to find a political solution ... the country 's neighbors and the international community must do everything in their power to help the interim kyrgyz government restore peace and stability , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
officials in kyrgyzstan have warned that the ethnic conflict could spread to the country 's north and neighboring countries as aid agencies attempt to cope with the humanitarian crisis in the central asian country .
some 2,000 people have been wounded in the fighting which erupted last thursday , according to official figures .
violence in the southern cities of osh and jalalabad has raised fears over the future stability of the country of 5.3 million , where uzbeks make up 14 percent of the population .
aid groups working overtime uzbekistan has been struggling to deal with a flood of ethnic refugees who crossed the border to escape the unrest .
with around 75,000 refugees already inside uzbekistan after fleeing the southern cities , authorities said they had closed off the border to prevent that number from swelling .
however the office of the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , which has been working to get relief supplies into the central asian countries , told deutsche welle it understood the border has now been reopened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations high commissioner for refugees , antonio guterres , warned of catastrophe " we have this understanding that the border is open .
we understand that yesterday it was closed temporarily for the night and now it is open , " says unhcr spokesperson babar baloch .
" the un high commissioner here in geneva , antonio guterres , has welcomed the uzbek authorities ' decision to open the border and welcome refugees who are seeking asylum in uzbekistan . "
baloch says that the unhcr plans to send six relief planes in total with 240 metric tons of supplies to uzbekistan in the coming days .
he said this would be followed by more aid once the unhcr had established a presence on the ground .
baloch added that the unhcr had been experiencing problems in reaching displaced peoples in areas around osh because of the security situation .
" we had hoped to be able to reach those people .
we have some stocks on the ground at the unhcr warehouse there in osh and we already have been in touch with the icrc -lrb- international committee of the red cross -rrb- to distribute the items we have there , but we understand and we are concerned at the poor security situation in osh and jalalabad and other areas which is impeding aid delivery . "
bildunterschrift : bodies litter the street as houses burn in jalabad military intervention meanwhile , roza otunbayeva , the interim president of kyrgyzstan , said on tuesday that there was no reason for russia to intervene by deploying peacekeepers to the crisis region .
she said the clashes were beginning to wane and that she hoped that her country 's own forces could get the situation under control .
moscow says it considers the violence in southern kyrgyzstan an internal matter for that country and has only sent several hundred troops to defend a russian military base in kyrgyzstan .
both russia and the united states have military installations in the central asian country , with the us using the strategic position as a hub to support its forces in afghanistan .
otunbayeva also said a planned constitutional referendum would go ahead on june 27 .
she was speaking at a press conference after the eu had warned that the violent clashes threatened to derail the country 's reform process .
however this view is not shared by icrc head of operations for central asia and eastern europe , pascale meige wagner , who warned " we 're far from seeing the end of this crisis . "
" we hear extremely worrying stories about people targeted - there is a will to harm and kill in kyrgzystan . "

massive amounts of oil are still gushing out and no one , neither bp nor the us government , can do anything about it .
are you astonished that the world 's superpower and one of the biggest oil company 's ca n't stop an oil leak ?
klaus toepfer : definitely .
i am to the utmost surprised .
it is not the only exploration in these depths , there are lots of others and if there is no possibility to stop such a leak then that gives us a totally new impression about the way we produce oil offshore ..
yes , it is more than astonishing that something is licensed when you can not handle a disaster like this .
president barack obama has been harshly criticised for his crisis management with charges that he has acted too late and not strongly enough .
how would you rate obama 's handling of the crisis ?
i think this was really an unexpected development .
that he is doing his utmost right now using not only strong words against bp , but also to integrate all the capacities of the superpower goes withhout saying .
so i would n't criticise him as harshly as he has been criticised by some commentators .
but this is a normal process in an open democratic system and you must be aware of those criticisms and you have to respond to it on a daily basis .
you have to have a clear understanding of the concerns of all the people living in the area most affected by the disaster .
you obviously have to focus on the ecological disaster , but this ecological disaster is linked with huge disaster for the people living in this region who earn their living with tourism , fishing and in other industries .
this serves as an important wake-up call that we now have to hurry up and change our options for producing electricity and energy so that we do n't need to depend any longer on these kinds of risky offshore endeavors .
bp has also been criticised very sharply over its handling and communication of the crisis .
what grade would you give them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toepfer i really believe they lost the control over how to handle the crisis and failed to live up to their responsibilty .
their performance was n't good at all and i am fairly sure that this will have consequences not only within bp , of course it has to start there , but for the industry as a whole .
we have to be aware that this is not only about bp , but there are comparable situations involving others as we saw with the exxon valdez and the disasters off the european coasts .
every crisis is of course an opportunity to learn and change something .
what consequences must be drawn from this crisis now ?
the first and most important consequence is : do your utmost to further develop new energy sources with lower risks .
because if we keep relying on fossil fuels , especially oil , we must recognize that the low-hanging fruits are already harvested and that we will maneuver ourselves into more and more risky and costly situations if we continue to rely on fossil fuels .
so it is high time that we further develop renewable energy and use sun and wind and biomass , geothermal and new energy sources like wave power .
we also have to realize now that the dream that oil is cheap is finally coming to an end .
of course it is easy to point one 's finger at the obama administration and bp for their handling of the crisis .
but are we sure that something like this could n't happen on our own front door in the north sea where there are also oil platforms and drilling ?
have germany and european countries done enough so that something like that ca n't happen there ?
the probability is definitely lower in the north sea .
there are different structures how to operate and handle those risks we saw in the gulf of mexico .
but nobody can be sure that there is zero risk in the north sea and other places in the world as well .
there is a risk , but the probability is much lower .
this oil disaster ranks already as the us ' worst environmental catastrophe in history .
as the un 's former point man on the environment : how bad is this on a global scale ?
this is a problem on a global scale without any doubt .
one should n't exaggerate it , but if you see all the images and pictures one can conclude that this is not just a limited problem in one region of the world , it is a clear signal for the whole world to come to a new assessment about those kinds of drillings and about oil production in general .
it would be a grave mistake to say do n't worry this is only a problem in the gulf of mexico .
klaus toepfer is the founding director of the institute for advanced sustainability studies in potsdam .
from 1998 to 2006 he was executive director of the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- .
prior to that he served as germany 's minister for the env ironment , nature conservation and nuclear safety between 1987 and 1994 .

many thousands of refugees are fleeing the ethnic clashes , with the united nations warning of a possible humanitarian catastrophe . ethnic groups in kyrgyzstan clashed again in overnight battles as the official death toll in the country rose to at least 179 , according to a report by the kyrgyz news agency akipress , quoting the health ministry . the ministry said that it expected the actual number of dead to be much higher . troops were patrolling streets in the city of osh on wednesday morning , following clashes between kyrgyz groups and the uzbek minority .
the number of civilians forced to flee the violence is now put at 275,000 according to the united nations high commission for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- . united nations children 's fund unicef reports that women , children and the elderly make up more than 90 percent of the refugees .
the situation was growing increasingly serious , the head of the unhcr said on wednesday . " what is happening is already a tragedy and it could become a catastrophe . "

officials in kyrgyzstan have warned that the ethnic conflict could spread to the country 's north and neighboring countries as aid agencies attempt to cope with the humanitarian crisis in the central asian country .
some 2,000 people have been wounded in the fighting which erupted last thursday , according to official figures .
violence in the southern cities of osh and jalalabad has raised fears over the future stability of the country of 5.3 million , where uzbeks make up 14 percent of the population .
aid groups working overtime uzbekistan has been struggling to deal with a flood of ethnic refugees who crossed the border to escape the unrest .
with around 75,000 refugees already inside uzbekistan after fleeing the southern cities , authorities said they had closed off the border to prevent that number from swelling .
however the office of the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , which has been working to get relief supplies into the central asian countries , told deutsche welle it understood the border has now been reopened .

" the un high commissioner here in geneva , antonio guterres , has welcomed the uzbek authorities ' decision to open the border and welcome refugees who are seeking asylum in uzbekistan . "
baloch says that the unhcr plans to send six relief planes in total with 240 metric tons of supplies to uzbekistan in the coming days .
he said this would be followed by more aid once the unhcr had established a presence on the ground .
baloch added that the unhcr had been experiencing problems in reaching displaced peoples in areas around osh because of the security situation .
" we had hoped to be able to reach those people .
we have some stocks on the ground at the unhcr warehouse there in osh and we already have been in touch with the icrc -lrb- international committee of the red cross -rrb- to distribute the items we have there , but we understand and we are concerned at the poor security situation in osh and jalalabad and other areas which is impeding aid delivery .

she said the clashes were beginning to wane and that she hoped that her country 's own forces could get the situation under control .
moscow says it considers the violence in southern kyrgyzstan an internal matter for that country and has only sent several hundred troops to defend a russian military base in kyrgyzstan .

massive amounts of oil are still gushing out and no one , neither bp nor the us government , can do anything about it .
are you astonished that the world 's superpower and one of the biggest oil company 's ca n't stop an oil leak ?
klaus toepfer : definitely .
i am to the utmost surprised .
it is not the only exploration in these depths , there are lots of others and if there is no possibility to stop such a leak then that gives us a totally new impression about the way we produce oil offshore ..
yes , it is more than astonishing that something is licensed when you can not handle a disaster like this .
president barack obama has been harshly criticised for his crisis management with charges that he has acted too late and not strongly enough .
how would you rate obama 's handling of the crisis ?
i think this was really an unexpected development .
that he is doing his utmost right now using not only strong words against bp , but also to integrate all the capacities of the superpower goes withhout saying .
so i would n't criticise him as harshly as he has been criticised by some commentators .
but this is a normal process in an open democratic system and you must be aware of those criticisms and you have to respond to it on a daily basis .
you have to have a clear understanding of the concerns of all the people living in the area most affected by the disaster .
you obviously have to focus on the ecological disaster , but this ecological disaster is linked with huge disaster for the people living in this region who earn their living with tourism , fishing and in other industries .
this serves as an important wake-up call that we now have to hurry up and change our options for producing electricity and energy so that we do n't need to depend any longer on these kinds of risky offshore endeavors .
bp has also been criticised very sharply over its handling and communication of the crisis .
what grade would you give them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toepfer i really believe they lost the control over how to handle the crisis and failed to live up to their responsibilty .
their performance was n't good at all and i am fairly sure that this will have consequences not only within bp , of course it has to start there , but for the industry as a whole .
we have to be aware that this is not only about bp , but there are comparable situations involving others as we saw with the exxon valdez and the disasters off the european coasts .
every crisis is of course an opportunity to learn and change something .
what consequences must be drawn from this crisis now ?
the first and most important consequence is : do your utmost to further develop new energy sources with lower risks .
because if we keep relying on fossil fuels , especially oil , we must recognize that the low-hanging fruits are already harvested and that we will maneuver ourselves into more and more risky and costly situations if we continue to rely on fossil fuels .
so it is high time that we further develop renewable energy and use sun and wind and biomass , geothermal and new energy sources like wave power .
we also have to realize now that the dream that oil is cheap is finally coming to an end .
of course it is easy to point one 's finger at the obama administration and bp for their handling of the crisis .
but are we sure that something like this could n't happen on our own front door in the north sea where there are also oil platforms and drilling ?
have germany and european countries done enough so that something like that ca n't happen there ?
the probability is definitely lower in the north sea .
there are different structures how to operate and handle those risks we saw in the gulf of mexico .
but nobody can be sure that there is zero risk in the north sea and other places in the world as well .
there is a risk , but the probability is much lower .
this oil disaster ranks already as the us ' worst environmental catastrophe in history .
as the un 's former point man on the environment : how bad is this on a global scale ?
this is a problem on a global scale without any doubt .
one should n't exaggerate it , but if you see all the images and pictures one can conclude that this is not just a limited problem in one region of the world , it is a clear signal for the whole world to come to a new assessment about those kinds of drillings and about oil production in general .
it would be a grave mistake to say do n't worry this is only a problem in the gulf of mexico .
klaus toepfer is the founding director of the institute for advanced sustainability studies in potsdam .
from 1998 to 2006 he was executive director of the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- .
prior to that he served as germany 's minister for the env ironment , nature conservation and nuclear safety between 1987 and 1994 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 16.06.2010 new report reveals shocking state of german education system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yet another report is critical of germany 's education system one in six germans aged between 20 and 30 has no vocational qualification and is no longer in the education system .
that is the main finding of a new report presented by the german education ministry . more evidence of the desperate state of germany 's education system was revealed on wednesday , with the pre-publication of statistics from a new " education in germany " report .
according to the report , which is to be presented thursday by the german education ministry and the state conference on education , an assembly of germany 's state education ministers , 17 percent of young germans aged between 20 and 30 have no vocational qualification and are no longer in the education system .
this marks a new high - in 2007 , the figure was still at 15.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezdemir is convinced the problems are endemic the situation is particularly dire among young people with an immigrant background , 30 percent of whom have no formal training and no prospect of achieving further qualifications .
in the face of increasing pressures in the job market , the researchers warned that germany could be facing a long-term unemployment problem for those without formal qualifications .
one forecast predicts that the supply of unqualified workers would exceed the number of jobs in this sector by some 1.3 million for the next 15 years .
for cem oezdemir , education spokesman for the green party , the deficits in germany 's system are appalling .
" we 're talking about a sort of risk-group that leaves school lacking basic reading , writing and arithmetic skills - they are functionally illiterate , " he told deutsche welle .
no surprises problems have been endemic for years , and the report 's findings provide few surprises for those concerned with german education .
stephanie odenwald , director for vocational training at the educational workers ' union gew , said , " it 's not a surprise - everyone who knows the education system has known this problem for years . "
odenwald can also identify one of the main causes of the problem : " it is mainly the fault of the misguided development of this massive transitional system , where young people leave school and do n't get into job training programs and instead get put into these waiting loops , or ' job preparation schemes ' as they are known .
there is a very wide body of opinion that says we need to get rid of this system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with an immigrant background are particularly disadvantaged this transitional system has often been blamed for leaving many of germany 's young people in limbo after leaving school , but oezdemir says that the problems are much deeper .
" what this study makes clear is that we need to question our whole education system - from kindergarten all the way to university , " he said .
" the interim system is just one element of it . "
the sacred cow gymnasium the new report is one of many that have indirectly brought attention to the injustices in germany 's three-tiered school system , which divides students according to ability into one of three different schools after the fourth grade - these are the hauptschule , the realschule and the elite gymnasium .
international comparisons like the pisa studies have highlighted the social inequalities that are caused by this system .
the report shows that hauptschule students continue to have problems finding job training places , even though the competition for them is said to be decreasing .
as far as oezdemir is concerned , germany 's conservative government resists reform because it is clinging to the gymnasium .
" there really is n't a recognition problem , " he says .
" these studies always come out with similar results .
there is an application problem .
we know the problems , but the politicians get bogged down in financial questions , and the taboo of the gymnasium .
the schools need to fit our children , not the other way round . "

marek and chris have already enjoyed a taste of success with their previous band atemlos .

we see ourselves as headed in a direction which will allow us to say we can be free to do what we want . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : oil spill in the gulf of mexico the oil disaster the world prefers to ignore americans vent anger over oil spill differently from europeans obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist full oil spill compensation looks increasingly unlikely disasters -pipe- 16.06.2010 bp oil spill must have global consequences , says former un expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neither bp nor the us government has been able to plug the leak in an interview with deutsche welle , the former director of the un 's environment program expresses his astonishment that the oil leak ca n't be stopped and demands consequences both at bp and beyond . deutsche welle : weeks after the explosion of the oil rig in the gulf of mexico it seems there is hardly any progress being made .
massive amounts of oil are still gushing out and no one , neither bp nor the us government , can do anything about it .
are you astonished that the world 's superpower and one of the biggest oil company 's ca n't stop an oil leak ?
klaus toepfer : definitely .
i am to the utmost surprised .
it is not the only exploration in these depths , there are lots of others and if there is no possibility to stop such a leak then that gives us a totally new impression about the way we produce oil offshore ..
yes , it is more than astonishing that something is licensed when you can not handle a disaster like this .
president barack obama has been harshly criticised for his crisis management with charges that he has acted too late and not strongly enough .
how would you rate obama 's handling of the crisis ?
i think this was really an unexpected development .
that he is doing his utmost right now using not only strong words against bp , but also to integrate all the capacities of the superpower goes withhout saying .
so i would n't criticise him as harshly as he has been criticised by some commentators .
but this is a normal process in an open democratic system and you must be aware of those criticisms and you have to respond to it on a daily basis .
you have to have a clear understanding of the concerns of all the people living in the area most affected by the disaster .
you obviously have to focus on the ecological disaster , but this ecological disaster is linked with huge disaster for the people living in this region who earn their living with tourism , fishing and in other industries .
this serves as an important wake-up call that we now have to hurry up and change our options for producing electricity and energy so that we do n't need to depend any longer on these kinds of risky offshore endeavors .
bp has also been criticised very sharply over its handling and communication of the crisis .
what grade would you give them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toepfer i really believe they lost the control over how to handle the crisis and failed to live up to their responsibilty .
their performance was n't good at all and i am fairly sure that this will have consequences not only within bp , of course it has to start there , but for the industry as a whole .
we have to be aware that this is not only about bp , but there are comparable situations involving others as we saw with the exxon valdez and the disasters off the european coasts .
every crisis is of course an opportunity to learn and change something .
what consequences must be drawn from this crisis now ?
the first and most important consequence is : do your utmost to further develop new energy sources with lower risks .
because if we keep relying on fossil fuels , especially oil , we must recognize that the low-hanging fruits are already harvested and that we will maneuver ourselves into more and more risky and costly situations if we continue to rely on fossil fuels .
so it is high time that we further develop renewable energy and use sun and wind and biomass , geothermal and new energy sources like wave power .
we also have to realize now that the dream that oil is cheap is finally coming to an end .
of course it is easy to point one 's finger at the obama administration and bp for their handling of the crisis .
but are we sure that something like this could n't happen on our own front door in the north sea where there are also oil platforms and drilling ?
have germany and european countries done enough so that something like that ca n't happen there ?
the probability is definitely lower in the north sea .
there are different structures how to operate and handle those risks we saw in the gulf of mexico .
but nobody can be sure that there is zero risk in the north sea and other places in the world as well .
there is a risk , but the probability is much lower .
this oil disaster ranks already as the us ' worst environmental catastrophe in history .
as the un 's former point man on the environment : how bad is this on a global scale ?
this is a problem on a global scale without any doubt .
one should n't exaggerate it , but if you see all the images and pictures one can conclude that this is not just a limited problem in one region of the world , it is a clear signal for the whole world to come to a new assessment about those kinds of drillings and about oil production in general .
it would be a grave mistake to say do n't worry this is only a problem in the gulf of mexico .
klaus toepfer is the founding director of the institute for advanced sustainability studies in potsdam .
from 1998 to 2006 he was executive director of the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- .
prior to that he served as germany 's minister for the env ironment , nature conservation and nuclear safety between 1987 and 1994 .

dw-world.de obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist us president obama has televised his tough stance against bp as oil continues to leak into the gulf of mexico .

now , according to india 's official press information bureau , afghanistan has invited india to invest in its mining sector , particularly in mining iron ore , copper , gold and coal . during a visit to india on tuesday , afghanistan 's mines minister wahidullah shahrani also sought india 's know-how in the field of mineral exploration .
he also said that afghanistan will launch a road show in london on june 25 , in which about 200 companies from across the globe will be invited to showcase their mining and exploration potential . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghanistan 's mines minister wahidullah shahrani india needs minerals and metals experts say resource-hungry india is not likely to forgo any opportunity to extract afghanistan 's untapped valuable mineral deposits , which also include lithium , a key material used in a wide range of consumer products . " india is an expanding economy and our requirements for different types of minerals will go up , " says santosh kumar , a former indian diplomat in new delhi .
" india is among the leading technological countries in the world .
and in those technologies like for example aerospace and so on , there are new metals and new applications for these metals required .
since we do n't have these metals and rare earths in india , some of them we import , so obviously any discoveries in our neighborhood would be of interest to us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian foreign secretary nirupama rao visits the indian embassy in kabul following a suicide attack in 2009 security is a challenge but expert kumar also points out that indian companies working in the field have some serious concerns : " for them , there are two problems .
one is the security situation .
the second is that these minerals are found in parts which are not well connected .
so transport is a critical issue . " following the attacks that killed seven indians in kabul earlier this year , new delhi has often expressed worries over the security of its nationals in afghanistan . many observers in the us also believe that security problems , weak infrastructure and corruption will be a hindrance for digging up the mineral riches .
there are also concerns that the taliban could intensify their campaign now that they know that afghanistan is sitting on a goldmine . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chinese delegation visiting the site of a copper mine in aynak in 2007 china and pakistan but given the scale of afghanistan 's mineral wealth , many may not hesitate to take a risk .
be it the americans themselves or the chinese , who have already invested in the vast aynak copper mine , south of kabul .
ye hailin , an expert from the chinese academy of social sciences , is cautious though .
" why would you connect this news with china ?
the us is the major player in afghanistan .
one should ask , what sort of new strategy can the united states plan now . " and what about afghanistan 's immediate neighbor pakistan ?
shahid kardar , a pakistani economist , believes that pakistan would rather be interested in providing logistical support than going for full-fledged investment . " i do n't think we will ever be in a position to be a serious investor .
but certainly in terms of being part of a value chain , in providing some low and middle level management , labor , transport and so on , we would be certainly better equipped than chinese and americans . " he also says that the mining of these valuable mineral deposits will lead to jobs for youth who otherwise join the taliban , also in the areas close to the pakistani-afghan border . author : disha uppal editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

earlier , in group h , switzerland shocked spain 1-0 , while chile overcame honduras by the same score line . uruguay have beaten south africa 3-0 in the second round of group a games at the world cup , pushing the south americans up to four points and leaving bafana bafana languishing on one point .
south africa started the game with energy and tight passing , taking it to the uruguayan defense .
however the dominant possession did n't pay dividends for the hosts , when uruguay scored in the 23rd minute through a looping shot from outside the box by atletico madrid striker diego forlan .
the ball tucked under the crossbar and into the back of the net , leaving south african keeper itumeleng khune helpless .
the goal did n't have a huge impact on south africa 's composure , but from that point onwards the possession balanced out and uruguay was allowed more time in their attacking third .
uruguay started the second half a different team , keeping the south african defense under pressure for the opening 15 minutes .
south africa seemed somewhat lackluster with the ball and were unable to threaten their opponent 's goal until the 65th minute after a cross from the right by siboniso gaxa to the near post met katlego mphela 's head , though the forward pushed the ball wide .
the death knell for south africa came in the 76th minute when khune was red carded for bringing down ajax striker luis suarez in the box after he was clear on goal .
forlan coolly smashed home the resultant penalty kick .
uruguay made it 3-0 with a close-range header from alvaro pereira deep in injury time from a suarez cross .
south africa must now hope for a win next tuesday against france if they are to have any hope of progressing to the round of 16 .

the swiss took the lead in the 52nd minute through a scrappy goal against the run of play from gelson fernandes , who picked up a loose ball after spanish keeper iker casillas collided with eren derdiyok in the box .
xavi alonso went closest to equalizing for the spaniards in the 70th minute when his shot from the edge of the box rebounded off the crossbar .
switzerland nearly went 2-0 up four minutes later when derdiyok weaved past two men in the box and struck the right post after a deft shot with the outside of his right boot .
the victory is the first for switzerland over spain in 19 meetings and represents by far the greatest upset so far in the world cup in south africa .
spain dominated possession in the first 45 minutes , getting most of their team behind the ball .

mineral resources worth about a trillion dollars have been found in afghanistan .
these include gold , iron , cobalt and lithium . the report about the pentagon 's huge afghan mineral finds and their economic potential has attracted a lot of attention in afghanistan .
many are upbeat about it .
abdurrahman ashraf , the advisor to president hamid karzai on mining issues , says that his government will conduct an in-depth investigation to verify the information .
" we have been given data which are necessary for the mining of the resources .
we will work with that , " he says .
" we will take samples on the ground and find out the mineral content of various deposits .
then we can say which deposits are economically worthwhile and which are not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president karzai 's government is conducting an investigation into the mineral deposits the information is not ' new ' the us government 's supposedly new information about the mineral riches is in fact not that new .
during the occupation of afghanistan in the 1980s , soviet geologists had already explored the soil and collected data .
after the withdrawal of the red army , afghan geologists hid the maps which their soviet colleagues had left behind .
the information remained under wraps until the western forces drove the taliban out of kabul in 2001 . the white house in washington seemed to have not known about the mineral resources until recently , when an internal memo by the us department of defense said the value of the deposits in afghanistan was about a trillion dollars .
sayfuddin sayhoon , an afghan economist believes that the us experts underestimate the wealth of his country : " the numbers given by the americans are understated .
some other sources even speak of a value of up to six trillion dollars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear that the taliban could intensify their insurgency after the recent revelations timing of the report experts in kabul wonder why washington has made this information public now .
some believe that the white house is trying to show us citizens that their soldiers are not fighting in vain , and that a lot of money is involved here .
economist sayhoon believes there could be other motives as well : " the us is warning us afghans and suggesting to us to consider exploiting and using these mineral resources .
moreover , the news is meant to attract the attention of western companies .
it seems that some western firms have already been contemplating about engaging in mining in afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several mineral deposits are hidden in the hindu kush mountains expertise needed maybe this is why karzai 's advisor abdurrahman ashraf is trying to play down the expectations .
" the mining and sale of these mineral resources require special expertise , which we do not have right now , " he says .
" moreover , our generation has not the right to sell everything . "
ashraf also suggests that afghans might prefer to sell the valuable mineral resources to china or india rather than to western buyers . experts however see such a statement as an attempt by the kabul government to use afghanistan 's mineral resources as an asset and to pit the west , china and india against each other - while keeping all options open . authors : arif farahmand , cem sey / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although food is already in short supply there , local farmers are reluctant to plant new crop varieties that promise better yields . in drought-prone regions of africa , people are often bitterly poor and food is scarce .
unfortunately , the inhabitants of those regions are the very people who , experts say , will be the first to suffer the consequences of climate change .
while droughts used to occur in eastern africa every seven years , they now occur almost every other year .
this negatively impacts food output in the region .
one organization working to improve food security in africa is the coalition for african rice development , which wants to drastically reduce the continent 's reliance on expensive rice imports .
it hopes to develop resilient new rice varieties and distribute them to smallholder farmers , thereby doubling rice production to 28 million tons per annum by the year 2018 .
however , not all farmers are willing to plant modified seeds , whether they be rice , maize or any another crop .
farmers resist change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smallholder maize farms in africa are suffering from less rainfall and higher temperatures christina sabini runs a small farm near morogoro , tanzania with her husband , and says less rain and more heat have reduced harvests during recent years .
like other farmers in the region , sabini says she has no choice but to adapt to the changing climate .
last year , she was offered new tan250 maize seeds , which were researched and tested in kenya and zimbabwe .
" these seeds are better because they also survive droughts , and they do provide good yields .
even without using fertilizer , i can reap good maize , " she said .
sabini was one of the few regional farmers who chose to accept the seeds , and she believes she made the right decision .
others were more conservative and continued using the traditional varieties .
according to cynthia awuor , a climate expert with the non-governmental organization care in kenya , developing drought-resistant seeds is only half the challenge faced by those whose want to curb world hunger by increasing crop yields .
convincing farmers to voluntarily change their habits and plant the new seeds can be very difficult .
" there 's much more exploration into drought tolerant species of maize as well as other crops .
at the same time , we are trying to promote crop varieties and seed varieties that were traditionally drought tolerant .
so we 're encouraging farmers to go into planting more and more sorghum , for example , and cassava , which are traditionally drought tolerant types of crops , " awuor told deutsche welle .
modified crops are slow to catch on but awuor and her organization are not the first to encounter resistance to modified crop varieties .
in the 1990 's , scientists cross bred a high-yield variety of asian rice with a stress-resistant african one .
the result was nerica , tough and locally adapted rice best suited for the highland or dry land environments which account for about 70 percent of africa 's rice farms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased food production may save lives as climate change progresses many farmers have been able to double their harvests , thanks to the new rice , but nerica did n't catch on until more than 80 varieties and thousands of lines were developed to cater to regions in 20 african countries .
thomas yanga works for the united nation 's world food program , where he is responsible for west africa .
he is well aware of the attitudes of farmers in his home country of cameroon .
" i know from my own village that the people are very , very attached to the taste of certain commodities .
and for them the taste is more important than anything else .
any new variety that does not give them the same taste , they will reject , " he told deutsche welle .
monty jones from sierra leone was awarded the world food prize six years ago for his role in developing nerica .
while he is proud of the rich harvest reaped from the new rice variety , he is worried about the impact of climate change in the future .
" at a certain level of distress – whether it 's drought , whether it 's flooding , whether it 's salinity – every material will break down .
basically , what we can do is to increase the level of resistance or tolerance to these problems , " he told deutsche welle .

" i know from my own village that the people are very , very attached to the taste of certain commodities .
and for them the taste is more important than anything else .
any new variety that does not give them the same taste , they will reject , " he told deutsche welle .
monty jones from sierra leone was awarded the world food prize six years ago for his role in developing nerica .
while he is proud of the rich harvest reaped from the new rice variety , he is worried about the impact of climate change in the future .
" at a certain level of distress – whether it 's drought , whether it 's flooding , whether it 's salinity – every material will break down .
basically , what we can do is to increase the level of resistance or tolerance to these problems , " he told deutsche welle .

mineral resources worth about a trillion dollars have been found in afghanistan .
these include gold , iron , cobalt and lithium . the report about the pentagon 's huge afghan mineral finds and their economic potential has attracted a lot of attention in afghanistan .
many are upbeat about it .
abdurrahman ashraf , the advisor to president hamid karzai on mining issues , says that his government will conduct an in-depth investigation to verify the information .
" we have been given data which are necessary for the mining of the resources .

after the withdrawal of the red army , afghan geologists hid the maps which their soviet colleagues had left behind .
the information remained under wraps until the western forces drove the taliban out of kabul in 2001 . the white house in washington seemed to have not known about the mineral resources until recently , when an internal memo by the us department of defense said the value of the deposits in afghanistan was about a trillion dollars .

ashraf also suggests that afghans might prefer to sell the valuable mineral resources to china or india rather than to western buyers . experts however see such a statement as an attempt by the kabul government to use afghanistan 's mineral resources as an asset and to pit the west , china and india against each other - while keeping all options open . authors : arif farahmand , cem sey / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 16.06.2010 newer crop varieties could check world hunger but meet with resistance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nerica rice can thrive in drought-prone environments drought-prone regions of africa are likely to be hard-hit as climate change continues .
although food is already in short supply there , local farmers are reluctant to plant new crop varieties that promise better yields . in drought-prone regions of africa , people are often bitterly poor and food is scarce .
unfortunately , the inhabitants of those regions are the very people who , experts say , will be the first to suffer the consequences of climate change .
while droughts used to occur in eastern africa every seven years , they now occur almost every other year .
this negatively impacts food output in the region .
one organization working to improve food security in africa is the coalition for african rice development , which wants to drastically reduce the continent 's reliance on expensive rice imports .
it hopes to develop resilient new rice varieties and distribute them to smallholder farmers , thereby doubling rice production to 28 million tons per annum by the year 2018 .
however , not all farmers are willing to plant modified seeds , whether they be rice , maize or any another crop .
farmers resist change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smallholder maize farms in africa are suffering from less rainfall and higher temperatures christina sabini runs a small farm near morogoro , tanzania with her husband , and says less rain and more heat have reduced harvests during recent years .
like other farmers in the region , sabini says she has no choice but to adapt to the changing climate .
last year , she was offered new tan250 maize seeds , which were researched and tested in kenya and zimbabwe .
" these seeds are better because they also survive droughts , and they do provide good yields .
even without using fertilizer , i can reap good maize , " she said .
sabini was one of the few regional farmers who chose to accept the seeds , and she believes she made the right decision .
others were more conservative and continued using the traditional varieties .
according to cynthia awuor , a climate expert with the non-governmental organization care in kenya , developing drought-resistant seeds is only half the challenge faced by those whose want to curb world hunger by increasing crop yields .
convincing farmers to voluntarily change their habits and plant the new seeds can be very difficult .
" there 's much more exploration into drought tolerant species of maize as well as other crops .
at the same time , we are trying to promote crop varieties and seed varieties that were traditionally drought tolerant .
so we 're encouraging farmers to go into planting more and more sorghum , for example , and cassava , which are traditionally drought tolerant types of crops , " awuor told deutsche welle .
modified crops are slow to catch on but awuor and her organization are not the first to encounter resistance to modified crop varieties .
in the 1990 's , scientists cross bred a high-yield variety of asian rice with a stress-resistant african one .
the result was nerica , tough and locally adapted rice best suited for the highland or dry land environments which account for about 70 percent of africa 's rice farms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased food production may save lives as climate change progresses many farmers have been able to double their harvests , thanks to the new rice , but nerica did n't catch on until more than 80 varieties and thousands of lines were developed to cater to regions in 20 african countries .
thomas yanga works for the united nation 's world food program , where he is responsible for west africa .
he is well aware of the attitudes of farmers in his home country of cameroon .
" i know from my own village that the people are very , very attached to the taste of certain commodities .
and for them the taste is more important than anything else .
any new variety that does not give them the same taste , they will reject , " he told deutsche welle .
monty jones from sierra leone was awarded the world food prize six years ago for his role in developing nerica .
while he is proud of the rich harvest reaped from the new rice variety , he is worried about the impact of climate change in the future .
" at a certain level of distress – whether it 's drought , whether it 's flooding , whether it 's salinity – every material will break down .
basically , what we can do is to increase the level of resistance or tolerance to these problems , " he told deutsche welle .

farmers resist change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smallholder maize farms in africa are suffering from less rainfall and higher temperatures christina sabini runs a small farm near morogoro , tanzania with her husband , and says less rain and more heat have reduced harvests during recent years .
like other farmers in the region , sabini says she has no choice but to adapt to the changing climate .
last year , she was offered new tan250 maize seeds , which were researched and tested in kenya and zimbabwe .
" these seeds are better because they also survive droughts , and they do provide good yields .
even without using fertilizer , i can reap good maize , " she said .
sabini was one of the few regional farmers who chose to accept the seeds , and she believes she made the right decision .
others were more conservative and continued using the traditional varieties .
according to cynthia awuor , a climate expert with the non-governmental organization care in kenya , developing drought-resistant seeds is only half the challenge faced by those whose want to curb world hunger by increasing crop yields .
convincing farmers to voluntarily change their habits and plant the new seeds can be very difficult .
" there 's much more exploration into drought tolerant species of maize as well as other crops .
at the same time , we are trying to promote crop varieties and seed varieties that were traditionally drought tolerant .
so we 're encouraging farmers to go into planting more and more sorghum , for example , and cassava , which are traditionally drought tolerant types of crops , " awuor told deutsche welle .
modified crops are slow to catch on but awuor and her organization are not the first to encounter resistance to modified crop varieties .
in the 1990 's , scientists cross bred a high-yield variety of asian rice with a stress-resistant african one .
the result was nerica , tough and locally adapted rice best suited for the highland or dry land environments which account for about 70 percent of africa 's rice farms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased food production may save lives as climate change progresses many farmers have been able to double their harvests , thanks to the new rice , but nerica did n't catch on until more than 80 varieties and thousands of lines were developed to cater to regions in 20 african countries .
thomas yanga works for the united nation 's world food program , where he is responsible for west africa .
he is well aware of the attitudes of farmers in his home country of cameroon .
" i know from my own village that the people are very , very attached to the taste of certain commodities .
and for them the taste is more important than anything else .
any new variety that does not give them the same taste , they will reject , " he told deutsche welle .
monty jones from sierra leone was awarded the world food prize six years ago for his role in developing nerica .
while he is proud of the rich harvest reaped from the new rice variety , he is worried about the impact of climate change in the future .
" at a certain level of distress – whether it 's drought , whether it 's flooding , whether it 's salinity – every material will break down .
basically , what we can do is to increase the level of resistance or tolerance to these problems , " he told deutsche welle .

but a new report says that laws alone are not going to solve the problem of racism and unequal treatment . the united nations human rights commission has said in a report released wednesday that germany is not doing enough to combat discrimination and racism .
the report , compiled by un special rapporteur githu muigai , praises germany for signing international conventions against intolerance and for having anti-discrimination laws .
but he said these legal standards are not always being implemented at the ground level .
petra follmar-otto , a researcher at the german institute for human rights , said that one problem is that most germans , and german law , tend to recognize only a narrow definition of racism .
" i think most people throughout germany , throughout the population , but also politicians or the courts or the police , when you talk about racism , they have some pictures in their mind , " follmar-otto said .
" and those pictures show right wing extremists ; skinheads who violently attack people with migration background or black people . "
follmar-otto said this attitude can actually make it more difficult to prevent more everyday forms of discrimination - in housing , education or work .
" when you focus on those right wing extremists , you will focus your efforts very much on the perpetrators , and not on the victims , " follmar-otto said .
" you really have to look into how discrimination is functioning in systems , for example , in schools , in the education system . "
laws need better enforcement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : racism means more than skinheads , researchers say the un report also said that the federal anti-discrimination agency , which is in charge of mediating complaints about discrimination , is underfunded , understaffed and lacks the mandate to prosecute cases of ethnic and racial discrimination .
it said the agency should take a more proactive role , and reach out to groups who face such unfair treatment .
" without a robust mandate , the equal treatment provisions contained in national legislation will not have a concrete effect on the lives of those who are or could be victims of discrimination , " the report said .
but some organizations who work with these groups say the german government has disappointed them before .
theodor ratgeber with the forum on human rights , a german umbrella group , told german radio that recommendations from the un 's previous report - which was on education in germany - still had not been implemented .
" i 'm speechless when i think of all that has n't happened , " ratgeber said .
" so the commissioner 's special report is really a wake up call .
i think they 're exactly right in their assessment about racism in this country .
i just hope the report will be properly heard in germany . "

mineral resources worth about a trillion dollars have been found in afghanistan .
these include gold , iron , cobalt and lithium . the report about the pentagon 's huge afghan mineral finds and their economic potential has attracted a lot of attention in afghanistan .
many are upbeat about it .
abdurrahman ashraf , the advisor to president hamid karzai on mining issues , says that his government will conduct an in-depth investigation to verify the information .
" we have been given data which are necessary for the mining of the resources .
we will work with that , " he says .
" we will take samples on the ground and find out the mineral content of various deposits .
then we can say which deposits are economically worthwhile and which are not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president karzai 's government is conducting an investigation into the mineral deposits the information is not ' new ' the us government 's supposedly new information about the mineral riches is in fact not that new .
during the occupation of afghanistan in the 1980s , soviet geologists had already explored the soil and collected data .
after the withdrawal of the red army , afghan geologists hid the maps which their soviet colleagues had left behind .
the information remained under wraps until the western forces drove the taliban out of kabul in 2001 . the white house in washington seemed to have not known about the mineral resources until recently , when an internal memo by the us department of defense said the value of the deposits in afghanistan was about a trillion dollars .
sayfuddin sayhoon , an afghan economist believes that the us experts underestimate the wealth of his country : " the numbers given by the americans are understated .
some other sources even speak of a value of up to six trillion dollars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear that the taliban could intensify their insurgency after the recent revelations timing of the report experts in kabul wonder why washington has made this information public now .
some believe that the white house is trying to show us citizens that their soldiers are not fighting in vain , and that a lot of money is involved here .
economist sayhoon believes there could be other motives as well : " the us is warning us afghans and suggesting to us to consider exploiting and using these mineral resources .
moreover , the news is meant to attract the attention of western companies .
it seems that some western firms have already been contemplating about engaging in mining in afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several mineral deposits are hidden in the hindu kush mountains expertise needed maybe this is why karzai 's advisor abdurrahman ashraf is trying to play down the expectations .
" the mining and sale of these mineral resources require special expertise , which we do not have right now , " he says .
" moreover , our generation has not the right to sell everything . "
ashraf also suggests that afghans might prefer to sell the valuable mineral resources to china or india rather than to western buyers . experts however see such a statement as an attempt by the kabul government to use afghanistan 's mineral resources as an asset and to pit the west , china and india against each other - while keeping all options open . authors : arif farahmand , cem sey / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mineral resources worth about a trillion dollars have been found in afghanistan .
these include gold , iron , cobalt and lithium . the report about the pentagon 's huge afghan mineral finds and their economic potential has attracted a lot of attention in afghanistan .
many are upbeat about it .
abdurrahman ashraf , the advisor to president hamid karzai on mining issues , says that his government will conduct an in-depth investigation to verify the information .
" we have been given data which are necessary for the mining of the resources .
we will work with that , " he says .
" we will take samples on the ground and find out the mineral content of various deposits .
then we can say which deposits are economically worthwhile and which are not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president karzai 's government is conducting an investigation into the mineral deposits the information is not ' new ' the us government 's supposedly new information about the mineral riches is in fact not that new .
during the occupation of afghanistan in the 1980s , soviet geologists had already explored the soil and collected data .
after the withdrawal of the red army , afghan geologists hid the maps which their soviet colleagues had left behind .
the information remained under wraps until the western forces drove the taliban out of kabul in 2001 . the white house in washington seemed to have not known about the mineral resources until recently , when an internal memo by the us department of defense said the value of the deposits in afghanistan was about a trillion dollars .
sayfuddin sayhoon , an afghan economist believes that the us experts underestimate the wealth of his country : " the numbers given by the americans are understated .
some other sources even speak of a value of up to six trillion dollars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear that the taliban could intensify their insurgency after the recent revelations timing of the report experts in kabul wonder why washington has made this information public now .
some believe that the white house is trying to show us citizens that their soldiers are not fighting in vain , and that a lot of money is involved here .
economist sayhoon believes there could be other motives as well : " the us is warning us afghans and suggesting to us to consider exploiting and using these mineral resources .
moreover , the news is meant to attract the attention of western companies .
it seems that some western firms have already been contemplating about engaging in mining in afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several mineral deposits are hidden in the hindu kush mountains expertise needed maybe this is why karzai 's advisor abdurrahman ashraf is trying to play down the expectations .
" the mining and sale of these mineral resources require special expertise , which we do not have right now , " he says .
" moreover , our generation has not the right to sell everything . "
ashraf also suggests that afghans might prefer to sell the valuable mineral resources to china or india rather than to western buyers . experts however see such a statement as an attempt by the kabul government to use afghanistan 's mineral resources as an asset and to pit the west , china and india against each other - while keeping all options open . authors : arif farahmand , cem sey / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that is the main finding of a new report presented by the german education ministry . more evidence of the desperate state of germany 's education system was revealed on wednesday , with the pre-publication of statistics from a new " education in germany " report .
according to the report , which is to be presented thursday by the german education ministry and the state conference on education , an assembly of germany 's state education ministers , 17 percent of young germans aged between 20 and 30 have no vocational qualification and are no longer in the education system .
this marks a new high - in 2007 , the figure was still at 15.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezdemir is convinced the problems are endemic the situation is particularly dire among young people with an immigrant background , 30 percent of whom have no formal training and no prospect of achieving further qualifications .
in the face of increasing pressures in the job market , the researchers warned that germany could be facing a long-term unemployment problem for those without formal qualifications .
one forecast predicts that the supply of unqualified workers would exceed the number of jobs in this sector by some 1.3 million for the next 15 years .
for cem oezdemir , education spokesman for the green party , the deficits in germany 's system are appalling .
" we 're talking about a sort of risk-group that leaves school lacking basic reading , writing and arithmetic skills - they are functionally illiterate , " he told deutsche welle .
no surprises problems have been endemic for years , and the report 's findings provide few surprises for those concerned with german education .
stephanie odenwald , director for vocational training at the educational workers ' union gew , said , " it 's not a surprise - everyone who knows the education system has known this problem for years . "
odenwald can also identify one of the main causes of the problem : " it is mainly the fault of the misguided development of this massive transitional system , where young people leave school and do n't get into job training programs and instead get put into these waiting loops , or ' job preparation schemes ' as they are known .
there is a very wide body of opinion that says we need to get rid of this system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with an immigrant background are particularly disadvantaged this transitional system has often been blamed for leaving many of germany 's young people in limbo after leaving school , but oezdemir says that the problems are much deeper .
" what this study makes clear is that we need to question our whole education system - from kindergarten all the way to university , " he said .
" the interim system is just one element of it . "
the sacred cow gymnasium the new report is one of many that have indirectly brought attention to the injustices in germany 's three-tiered school system , which divides students according to ability into one of three different schools after the fourth grade - these are the hauptschule , the realschule and the elite gymnasium .
international comparisons like the pisa studies have highlighted the social inequalities that are caused by this system .
the report shows that hauptschule students continue to have problems finding job training places , even though the competition for them is said to be decreasing .
as far as oezdemir is concerned , germany 's conservative government resists reform because it is clinging to the gymnasium .
" there really is n't a recognition problem , " he says .
" these studies always come out with similar results .
there is an application problem .
we know the problems , but the politicians get bogged down in financial questions , and the taboo of the gymnasium .
the schools need to fit our children , not the other way round . "

mineral resources worth about a trillion dollars have been found in afghanistan .
these include gold , iron , cobalt and lithium . the report about the pentagon 's huge afghan mineral finds and their economic potential has attracted a lot of attention in afghanistan .
many are upbeat about it .
abdurrahman ashraf , the advisor to president hamid karzai on mining issues , says that his government will conduct an in-depth investigation to verify the information .
" we have been given data which are necessary for the mining of the resources .
we will work with that , " he says .
" we will take samples on the ground and find out the mineral content of various deposits .
then we can say which deposits are economically worthwhile and which are not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president karzai 's government is conducting an investigation into the mineral deposits the information is not ' new ' the us government 's supposedly new information about the mineral riches is in fact not that new .
during the occupation of afghanistan in the 1980s , soviet geologists had already explored the soil and collected data .
after the withdrawal of the red army , afghan geologists hid the maps which their soviet colleagues had left behind .
the information remained under wraps until the western forces drove the taliban out of kabul in 2001 . the white house in washington seemed to have not known about the mineral resources until recently , when an internal memo by the us department of defense said the value of the deposits in afghanistan was about a trillion dollars .
sayfuddin sayhoon , an afghan economist believes that the us experts underestimate the wealth of his country : " the numbers given by the americans are understated .
some other sources even speak of a value of up to six trillion dollars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear that the taliban could intensify their insurgency after the recent revelations timing of the report experts in kabul wonder why washington has made this information public now .
some believe that the white house is trying to show us citizens that their soldiers are not fighting in vain , and that a lot of money is involved here .
economist sayhoon believes there could be other motives as well : " the us is warning us afghans and suggesting to us to consider exploiting and using these mineral resources .
moreover , the news is meant to attract the attention of western companies .
it seems that some western firms have already been contemplating about engaging in mining in afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several mineral deposits are hidden in the hindu kush mountains expertise needed maybe this is why karzai 's advisor abdurrahman ashraf is trying to play down the expectations .
" the mining and sale of these mineral resources require special expertise , which we do not have right now , " he says .
" moreover , our generation has not the right to sell everything . "
ashraf also suggests that afghans might prefer to sell the valuable mineral resources to china or india rather than to western buyers . experts however see such a statement as an attempt by the kabul government to use afghanistan 's mineral resources as an asset and to pit the west , china and india against each other - while keeping all options open . authors : arif farahmand , cem sey / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dams and manmade reservoirs also encroach upon humans , wildlife and natural habitats .
a company based in south western germany that specializes in making high-performance pumps is currently testing a solution that can use the power of the river without affecting its ecosystem .
dieter-heinz hellmann , member of the ksb board of management , will present the operating principle of the new river turbine at this year ’ s deutsche welle global media forum in bonn , germany .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
ksb engineers turned a basic principle on its head .
bchanging the direction of flow , a pump can be used as a turbine and vice versa .
in other words , by introducing flow to a pump propeller in reverse , it begins rotating and turns the pump into a turbine .
the motor then behaves like a generator and the pump produces electricity .
a seven-meter-long river turbine prototype has been operating since march 2010 in a tributary of the rhine river near st. goar , where it produces hydroelectricity without any disruptive dam constructions .
only a few buoys bob on the surface , indicating the location of the turbine .
initial tests have shown that the ksb turbine neither interferes with the river ’ s ecosystem nor impedes the migratory routes of fish .
engineers at the ksb group think that their innovation could revolutionize the use of hydropower .
trial operation is scheduled to take an ambitious plunge this summer when a single river turbine will be used to convert the currents of the rhine into electricity to power ten households . more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .
deutsche welle is cooperating with many different organizations for this interdisciplinary conference , including the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the international human dimensions program on global environmental change -lrb- un ihdp / essp -rrb- , eu commission and the world bank , the wuppertal institute , world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , nabu and the climate alliance , the institute for world business kiel , german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- , the center for development research -lrb- zef -rrb- and many others .

a company based in south western germany that specializes in making high-performance pumps is currently testing a solution that can use the power of the river without affecting its ecosystem .
dieter-heinz hellmann , member of the ksb board of management , will present the operating principle of the new river turbine at this year ’ s deutsche welle global media forum in bonn , germany .

initial tests have shown that the ksb turbine neither interferes with the river ’ s ecosystem nor impedes the migratory routes of fish .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 16.06.2010 new report reveals shocking state of german education system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yet another report is critical of germany 's education system one in six germans aged between 20 and 30 has no vocational qualification and is no longer in the education system .
that is the main finding of a new report presented by the german education ministry . more evidence of the desperate state of germany 's education system was revealed on wednesday , with the pre-publication of statistics from a new " education in germany " report .
according to the report , which is to be presented thursday by the german education ministry and the state conference on education , an assembly of germany 's state education ministers , 17 percent of young germans aged between 20 and 30 have no vocational qualification and are no longer in the education system .
this marks a new high - in 2007 , the figure was still at 15.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezdemir is convinced the problems are endemic the situation is particularly dire among young people with an immigrant background , 30 percent of whom have no formal training and no prospect of achieving further qualifications .
in the face of increasing pressures in the job market , the researchers warned that germany could be facing a long-term unemployment problem for those without formal qualifications .
one forecast predicts that the supply of unqualified workers would exceed the number of jobs in this sector by some 1.3 million for the next 15 years .
for cem oezdemir , education spokesman for the green party , the deficits in germany 's system are appalling .
" we 're talking about a sort of risk-group that leaves school lacking basic reading , writing and arithmetic skills - they are functionally illiterate , " he told deutsche welle .
no surprises problems have been endemic for years , and the report 's findings provide few surprises for those concerned with german education .
stephanie odenwald , director for vocational training at the educational workers ' union gew , said , " it 's not a surprise - everyone who knows the education system has known this problem for years . "
odenwald can also identify one of the main causes of the problem : " it is mainly the fault of the misguided development of this massive transitional system , where young people leave school and do n't get into job training programs and instead get put into these waiting loops , or ' job preparation schemes ' as they are known .
there is a very wide body of opinion that says we need to get rid of this system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with an immigrant background are particularly disadvantaged this transitional system has often been blamed for leaving many of germany 's young people in limbo after leaving school , but oezdemir says that the problems are much deeper .
" what this study makes clear is that we need to question our whole education system - from kindergarten all the way to university , " he said .
" the interim system is just one element of it . "
the sacred cow gymnasium the new report is one of many that have indirectly brought attention to the injustices in germany 's three-tiered school system , which divides students according to ability into one of three different schools after the fourth grade - these are the hauptschule , the realschule and the elite gymnasium .
international comparisons like the pisa studies have highlighted the social inequalities that are caused by this system .
the report shows that hauptschule students continue to have problems finding job training places , even though the competition for them is said to be decreasing .
as far as oezdemir is concerned , germany 's conservative government resists reform because it is clinging to the gymnasium .
" there really is n't a recognition problem , " he says .
" these studies always come out with similar results .
there is an application problem .
we know the problems , but the politicians get bogged down in financial questions , and the taboo of the gymnasium .
the schools need to fit our children , not the other way round . "

that is the main finding of a new report presented by the german education ministry . more evidence of the desperate state of germany 's education system was revealed on wednesday , with the pre-publication of statistics from a new " education in germany " report .
according to the report , which is to be presented thursday by the german education ministry and the state conference on education , an assembly of germany 's state education ministers , 17 percent of young germans aged between 20 and 30 have no vocational qualification and are no longer in the education system .
this marks a new high - in 2007 , the figure was still at 15.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezdemir is convinced the problems are endemic the situation is particularly dire among young people with an immigrant background , 30 percent of whom have no formal training and no prospect of achieving further qualifications .
in the face of increasing pressures in the job market , the researchers warned that germany could be facing a long-term unemployment problem for those without formal qualifications .
one forecast predicts that the supply of unqualified workers would exceed the number of jobs in this sector by some 1.3 million for the next 15 years .
for cem oezdemir , education spokesman for the green party , the deficits in germany 's system are appalling .
" we 're talking about a sort of risk-group that leaves school lacking basic reading , writing and arithmetic skills - they are functionally illiterate , " he told deutsche welle .
no surprises problems have been endemic for years , and the report 's findings provide few surprises for those concerned with german education .
stephanie odenwald , director for vocational training at the educational workers ' union gew , said , " it 's not a surprise - everyone who knows the education system has known this problem for years . "
odenwald can also identify one of the main causes of the problem : " it is mainly the fault of the misguided development of this massive transitional system , where young people leave school and do n't get into job training programs and instead get put into these waiting loops , or ' job preparation schemes ' as they are known .
there is a very wide body of opinion that says we need to get rid of this system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with an immigrant background are particularly disadvantaged this transitional system has often been blamed for leaving many of germany 's young people in limbo after leaving school , but oezdemir says that the problems are much deeper .
" what this study makes clear is that we need to question our whole education system - from kindergarten all the way to university , " he said .
" the interim system is just one element of it . "
the sacred cow gymnasium the new report is one of many that have indirectly brought attention to the injustices in germany 's three-tiered school system , which divides students according to ability into one of three different schools after the fourth grade - these are the hauptschule , the realschule and the elite gymnasium .
international comparisons like the pisa studies have highlighted the social inequalities that are caused by this system .
the report shows that hauptschule students continue to have problems finding job training places , even though the competition for them is said to be decreasing .
as far as oezdemir is concerned , germany 's conservative government resists reform because it is clinging to the gymnasium .
" there really is n't a recognition problem , " he says .
" these studies always come out with similar results .
there is an application problem .
we know the problems , but the politicians get bogged down in financial questions , and the taboo of the gymnasium .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 16.06.2010 uruguay beat south africa after shock swiss victory over spain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's goal came against the run of play uruguay have beaten south africa 3-0 in the second round of group a games at the world cup .
earlier , in group h , switzerland shocked spain 1-0 , while chile overcame honduras by the same score line . uruguay have beaten south africa 3-0 in the second round of group a games at the world cup , pushing the south americans up to four points and leaving bafana bafana languishing on one point .
south africa started the game with energy and tight passing , taking it to the uruguayan defense .
however the dominant possession did n't pay dividends for the hosts , when uruguay scored in the 23rd minute through a looping shot from outside the box by atletico madrid striker diego forlan .
the ball tucked under the crossbar and into the back of the net , leaving south african keeper itumeleng khune helpless .
the goal did n't have a huge impact on south africa 's composure , but from that point onwards the possession balanced out and uruguay was allowed more time in their attacking third .
uruguay started the second half a different team , keeping the south african defense under pressure for the opening 15 minutes .
south africa seemed somewhat lackluster with the ball and were unable to threaten their opponent 's goal until the 65th minute after a cross from the right by siboniso gaxa to the near post met katlego mphela 's head , though the forward pushed the ball wide .
the death knell for south africa came in the 76th minute when khune was red carded for bringing down ajax striker luis suarez in the box after he was clear on goal .
forlan coolly smashed home the resultant penalty kick .
uruguay made it 3-0 with a close-range header from alvaro pereira deep in injury time from a suarez cross .
south africa must now hope for a win next tuesday against france if they are to have any hope of progressing to the round of 16 .
shock in nelspruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland upset spain , who were title favorites in wednesday 's afternoon match , european title holders spain were toppled in their first world cup match after going down 1-0 in a shock loss to ottmar hitzfeld ’ s switzerland .
the swiss took the lead in the 52nd minute through a scrappy goal against the run of play from gelson fernandes , who picked up a loose ball after spanish keeper iker casillas collided with eren derdiyok in the box .
xavi alonso went closest to equalizing for the spaniards in the 70th minute when his shot from the edge of the box rebounded off the crossbar .
switzerland nearly went 2-0 up four minutes later when derdiyok weaved past two men in the box and struck the right post after a deft shot with the outside of his right boot .
the victory is the first for switzerland over spain in 19 meetings and represents by far the greatest upset so far in the world cup in south africa .
spain dominated possession in the first 45 minutes , getting most of their team behind the ball .
the best chance fell to gerard pique , who cut back inside swiss defender stephane grichting but saw his shot rebound off the legs of keeper diego benaglio .
despite showing sparks of brilliance with the ball , spain rarely threatened during the half , while switzerland , too , lacked any real scoring opportunities .
vicente del bosque 's spain , which , going into the tournament , was among the teams most favored to lift the world cup , were expected to come away with all three points against switzerland .

mineral resources worth about a trillion dollars have been found in afghanistan .
these include gold , iron , cobalt and lithium . the report about the pentagon 's huge afghan mineral finds and their economic potential has attracted a lot of attention in afghanistan .
many are upbeat about it .
abdurrahman ashraf , the advisor to president hamid karzai on mining issues , says that his government will conduct an in-depth investigation to verify the information .
" we have been given data which are necessary for the mining of the resources .
we will work with that , " he says .
" we will take samples on the ground and find out the mineral content of various deposits .
then we can say which deposits are economically worthwhile and which are not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president karzai 's government is conducting an investigation into the mineral deposits the information is not ' new ' the us government 's supposedly new information about the mineral riches is in fact not that new .
during the occupation of afghanistan in the 1980s , soviet geologists had already explored the soil and collected data .
after the withdrawal of the red army , afghan geologists hid the maps which their soviet colleagues had left behind .
the information remained under wraps until the western forces drove the taliban out of kabul in 2001 . the white house in washington seemed to have not known about the mineral resources until recently , when an internal memo by the us department of defense said the value of the deposits in afghanistan was about a trillion dollars .
sayfuddin sayhoon , an afghan economist believes that the us experts underestimate the wealth of his country : " the numbers given by the americans are understated .
some other sources even speak of a value of up to six trillion dollars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear that the taliban could intensify their insurgency after the recent revelations timing of the report experts in kabul wonder why washington has made this information public now .
some believe that the white house is trying to show us citizens that their soldiers are not fighting in vain , and that a lot of money is involved here .
economist sayhoon believes there could be other motives as well : " the us is warning us afghans and suggesting to us to consider exploiting and using these mineral resources .
moreover , the news is meant to attract the attention of western companies .
it seems that some western firms have already been contemplating about engaging in mining in afghanistan . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several mineral deposits are hidden in the hindu kush mountains expertise needed maybe this is why karzai 's advisor abdurrahman ashraf is trying to play down the expectations .
" the mining and sale of these mineral resources require special expertise , which we do not have right now , " he says .
" moreover , our generation has not the right to sell everything . "
ashraf also suggests that afghans might prefer to sell the valuable mineral resources to china or india rather than to western buyers . experts however see such a statement as an attempt by the kabul government to use afghanistan 's mineral resources as an asset and to pit the west , china and india against each other - while keeping all options open . authors : arif farahmand , cem sey / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup -pipe- 16.06.2010 uruguay beat south africa after shock swiss victory over spain großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forlan 's goal came against the run of play uruguay have beaten south africa 3-0 in the second round of group a games at the world cup .
earlier , in group h , switzerland shocked spain 1-0 , while chile overcame honduras by the same score line . uruguay have beaten south africa 3-0 in the second round of group a games at the world cup , pushing the south americans up to four points and leaving bafana bafana languishing on one point .
south africa started the game with energy and tight passing , taking it to the uruguayan defense .
however the dominant possession did n't pay dividends for the hosts , when uruguay scored in the 23rd minute through a looping shot from outside the box by atletico madrid striker diego forlan .
the ball tucked under the crossbar and into the back of the net , leaving south african keeper itumeleng khune helpless .
the goal did n't have a huge impact on south africa 's composure , but from that point onwards the possession balanced out and uruguay was allowed more time in their attacking third .
uruguay started the second half a different team , keeping the south african defense under pressure for the opening 15 minutes .
south africa seemed somewhat lackluster with the ball and were unable to threaten their opponent 's goal until the 65th minute after a cross from the right by siboniso gaxa to the near post met katlego mphela 's head , though the forward pushed the ball wide .
the death knell for south africa came in the 76th minute when khune was red carded for bringing down ajax striker luis suarez in the box after he was clear on goal .
forlan coolly smashed home the resultant penalty kick .
uruguay made it 3-0 with a close-range header from alvaro pereira deep in injury time from a suarez cross .
south africa must now hope for a win next tuesday against france if they are to have any hope of progressing to the round of 16 .
shock in nelspruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland upset spain , who were title favorites in wednesday 's afternoon match , european title holders spain were toppled in their first world cup match after going down 1-0 in a shock loss to ottmar hitzfeld ’ s switzerland .
the swiss took the lead in the 52nd minute through a scrappy goal against the run of play from gelson fernandes , who picked up a loose ball after spanish keeper iker casillas collided with eren derdiyok in the box .
xavi alonso went closest to equalizing for the spaniards in the 70th minute when his shot from the edge of the box rebounded off the crossbar .
switzerland nearly went 2-0 up four minutes later when derdiyok weaved past two men in the box and struck the right post after a deft shot with the outside of his right boot .
the victory is the first for switzerland over spain in 19 meetings and represents by far the greatest upset so far in the world cup in south africa .
spain dominated possession in the first 45 minutes , getting most of their team behind the ball .
the best chance fell to gerard pique , who cut back inside swiss defender stephane grichting but saw his shot rebound off the legs of keeper diego benaglio .
despite showing sparks of brilliance with the ball , spain rarely threatened during the half , while switzerland , too , lacked any real scoring opportunities .
vicente del bosque 's spain , which , going into the tournament , was among the teams most favored to lift the world cup , were expected to come away with all three points against switzerland .
victory after 48 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beausejour -lrb- in red -rrb- shoots to score past honduras goalkeeper noel valladares in the day 's opening group h match , chile ended a 48-year winless streak in the world cup by overcoming honduras 1-0 at mbombela stadium in nelspruit .
striker jean beausejour bagged the only goal of the game .
in a game which it dominated , chile were unlucky not to extend their lead after man-of-the-match beausejour 's 34th minute strike .
the goal followed some slick passing in the honduran box which created space for mauricio isla on the right flank to get a low cross in at the near post , which was turned in by the mexico-based beausejour .
chile defender waldo ponce came forward for a free kick midway through the second half and should have doubled the lead only for veteran goalie noel valladares to parry away a diving point-blank header .
midfielder jorge valdivia had another chance at the goal 15 minutes from full-time , but was correctly flagged offside as the " killer " second goal continued to elude chile .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : oil spill in the gulf of mexico the oil disaster the world prefers to ignore americans vent anger over oil spill differently from europeans obama hardens tone against bp as doubts over compensation persist full oil spill compensation looks increasingly unlikely disasters -pipe- 16.06.2010 bp oil spill must have global consequences , says former un expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neither bp nor the us government has been able to plug the leak in an interview with deutsche welle , the former director of the un 's environment program expresses his astonishment that the oil leak ca n't be stopped and demands consequences both at bp and beyond . deutsche welle : weeks after the explosion of the oil rig in the gulf of mexico it seems there is hardly any progress being made .
massive amounts of oil are still gushing out and no one , neither bp nor the us government , can do anything about it .
are you astonished that the world 's superpower and one of the biggest oil company 's ca n't stop an oil leak ?
klaus toepfer : definitely .
i am to the utmost surprised .
it is not the only exploration in these depths , there are lots of others and if there is no possibility to stop such a leak then that gives us a totally new impression about the way we produce oil offshore ..
yes , it is more than astonishing that something is licensed when you can not handle a disaster like this .
president barack obama has been harshly criticised for his crisis management with charges that he has acted too late and not strongly enough .
how would you rate obama 's handling of the crisis ?
i think this was really an unexpected development .
that he is doing his utmost right now using not only strong words against bp , but also to integrate all the capacities of the superpower goes withhout saying .
so i would n't criticise him as harshly as he has been criticised by some commentators .
but this is a normal process in an open democratic system and you must be aware of those criticisms and you have to respond to it on a daily basis .
you have to have a clear understanding of the concerns of all the people living in the area most affected by the disaster .
you obviously have to focus on the ecological disaster , but this ecological disaster is linked with huge disaster for the people living in this region who earn their living with tourism , fishing and in other industries .
this serves as an important wake-up call that we now have to hurry up and change our options for producing electricity and energy so that we do n't need to depend any longer on these kinds of risky offshore endeavors .
bp has also been criticised very sharply over its handling and communication of the crisis .
what grade would you give them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toepfer i really believe they lost the control over how to handle the crisis and failed to live up to their responsibilty .
their performance was n't good at all and i am fairly sure that this will have consequences not only within bp , of course it has to start there , but for the industry as a whole .
we have to be aware that this is not only about bp , but there are comparable situations involving others as we saw with the exxon valdez and the disasters off the european coasts .
every crisis is of course an opportunity to learn and change something .
what consequences must be drawn from this crisis now ?
the first and most important consequence is : do your utmost to further develop new energy sources with lower risks .
because if we keep relying on fossil fuels , especially oil , we must recognize that the low-hanging fruits are already harvested and that we will maneuver ourselves into more and more risky and costly situations if we continue to rely on fossil fuels .
so it is high time that we further develop renewable energy and use sun and wind and biomass , geothermal and new energy sources like wave power .
we also have to realize now that the dream that oil is cheap is finally coming to an end .
of course it is easy to point one 's finger at the obama administration and bp for their handling of the crisis .
but are we sure that something like this could n't happen on our own front door in the north sea where there are also oil platforms and drilling ?
have germany and european countries done enough so that something like that ca n't happen there ?
the probability is definitely lower in the north sea .
there are different structures how to operate and handle those risks we saw in the gulf of mexico .
but nobody can be sure that there is zero risk in the north sea and other places in the world as well .
there is a risk , but the probability is much lower .
this oil disaster ranks already as the us ' worst environmental catastrophe in history .
as the un 's former point man on the environment : how bad is this on a global scale ?
this is a problem on a global scale without any doubt .
one should n't exaggerate it , but if you see all the images and pictures one can conclude that this is not just a limited problem in one region of the world , it is a clear signal for the whole world to come to a new assessment about those kinds of drillings and about oil production in general .
it would be a grave mistake to say do n't worry this is only a problem in the gulf of mexico .
klaus toepfer is the founding director of the institute for advanced sustainability studies in potsdam .
from 1998 to 2006 he was executive director of the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- .
prior to that he served as germany 's minister for the env ironment , nature conservation and nuclear safety between 1987 and 1994 .

massive amounts of oil are still gushing out and no one , neither bp nor the us government , can do anything about it .
are you astonished that the world 's superpower and one of the biggest oil company 's ca n't stop an oil leak ?
klaus toepfer : definitely .
i am to the utmost surprised .
it is not the only exploration in these depths , there are lots of others and if there is no possibility to stop such a leak then that gives us a totally new impression about the way we produce oil offshore ..
yes , it is more than astonishing that something is licensed when you can not handle a disaster like this .
president barack obama has been harshly criticised for his crisis management with charges that he has acted too late and not strongly enough .
how would you rate obama 's handling of the crisis ?
i think this was really an unexpected development .
that he is doing his utmost right now using not only strong words against bp , but also to integrate all the capacities of the superpower goes withhout saying .
so i would n't criticise him as harshly as he has been criticised by some commentators .
but this is a normal process in an open democratic system and you must be aware of those criticisms and you have to respond to it on a daily basis .
you have to have a clear understanding of the concerns of all the people living in the area most affected by the disaster .
you obviously have to focus on the ecological disaster , but this ecological disaster is linked with huge disaster for the people living in this region who earn their living with tourism , fishing and in other industries .
this serves as an important wake-up call that we now have to hurry up and change our options for producing electricity and energy so that we do n't need to depend any longer on these kinds of risky offshore endeavors .
bp has also been criticised very sharply over its handling and communication of the crisis .
what grade would you give them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toepfer i really believe they lost the control over how to handle the crisis and failed to live up to their responsibilty .
their performance was n't good at all and i am fairly sure that this will have consequences not only within bp , of course it has to start there , but for the industry as a whole .
we have to be aware that this is not only about bp , but there are comparable situations involving others as we saw with the exxon valdez and the disasters off the european coasts .
every crisis is of course an opportunity to learn and change something .
what consequences must be drawn from this crisis now ?
the first and most important consequence is : do your utmost to further develop new energy sources with lower risks .
because if we keep relying on fossil fuels , especially oil , we must recognize that the low-hanging fruits are already harvested and that we will maneuver ourselves into more and more risky and costly situations if we continue to rely on fossil fuels .
so it is high time that we further develop renewable energy and use sun and wind and biomass , geothermal and new energy sources like wave power .
we also have to realize now that the dream that oil is cheap is finally coming to an end .
of course it is easy to point one 's finger at the obama administration and bp for their handling of the crisis .
but are we sure that something like this could n't happen on our own front door in the north sea where there are also oil platforms and drilling ?
have germany and european countries done enough so that something like that ca n't happen there ?
the probability is definitely lower in the north sea .
there are different structures how to operate and handle those risks we saw in the gulf of mexico .
but nobody can be sure that there is zero risk in the north sea and other places in the world as well .
there is a risk , but the probability is much lower .
this oil disaster ranks already as the us ' worst environmental catastrophe in history .
as the un 's former point man on the environment : how bad is this on a global scale ?
this is a problem on a global scale without any doubt .
one should n't exaggerate it , but if you see all the images and pictures one can conclude that this is not just a limited problem in one region of the world , it is a clear signal for the whole world to come to a new assessment about those kinds of drillings and about oil production in general .
it would be a grave mistake to say do n't worry this is only a problem in the gulf of mexico .

but the band do have one thing in common with the world ’ s most famous book : a knowledge that big things are going to happen . abel & cain 's lead singer chris blöcher is sure that pretty soon there 'll come a time when stadium crowds are singing along to their songs .
" basically we ’ re ready for our time , our d-day in the music scene if you like , " he said , " that ’ s the only thing we want to do and we 're giving it our all to make sure it happens . "
quite ambitious , one might think , to compare their musical breakthrough with the normandy landings , but these aren ’ t empty words .
marek and chris have already enjoyed a taste of success with their previous band atemlos .
they scored three sizable chart hits , shot a bunch of music videos and were even featured on german music tv channel viva .
but despite their burgeoning popularity , they decided the direction the band was heading in just was n't them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : front man chris onstage a knack for pathos they let the atemlos project fold and switched to singing in english with the formation of abel & cain .
they 're not shy about citing big guns like oasis and coldplay as influences ; their music is rock with an emotional slant … and not necessarily always with positive origins .
" all these emotional songs and melodies actually originate from certain feelings of rage , " explains chris , " not necessarily against things which you have done wrong yourself but things that are or were frustrating and which play off each other .
we see ourselves as headed in a direction which will allow us to say we can be free to do what we want . "
their journey to fame and fortune has seen them successfully complete a stint at popcamp , an intense band coaching boot camp organized by the german music council , and put the finishing touches to the recordings for their debut album .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popcamp is a high-level band coaching project sponsored by the german music council all set for the international market chris is actually dreaming of a future where he isn ’ t chained to germany : " i 'd like to be somewhere where no one knows who i am , where i do n't know anyone , where i 'd never know what might happen when i walk around the corner .
that ’ s what i want . "
in order to accomplish that , he 's ditched the idea of singing in german with the view that english songs fare better internationally than german ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today the clubs , tomorrow the stadiums ?
the five year plan abel & cain are n't dreaming of success ; as far as the four guys from düsseldorf are concerned , they 're already convinced it 's going to happen and that this is the right time .
at the moment , they 're all working flat out towards this goal so much so that chris knows exactly where he sees the band in five years ' time .
" i want to see the music we make mature and to see it develop into something round and perfect , " he adds , " i can picture way more live shows , touring our third album . i can really see us doing well in this business .
in fact , i can ’ t imagine anything else . "
abel & cain consists of : christian blöcher -lrb- vocals , guitar -rrb- marek noe -lrb- vocals , guitar -rrb- dominik skworz -lrb- bass -rrb- alexander wenk -lrb- drums -rrb- author : ulli jose anders editor : neale lytollis / rick fulker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the band do have one thing in common with the world ’ s most famous book : a knowledge that big things are going to happen . abel & cain 's lead singer chris blöcher is sure that pretty soon there 'll come a time when stadium crowds are singing along to their songs .
" basically we ’ re ready for our time , our d-day in the music scene if you like , " he said , " that ’ s the only thing we want to do and we 're giving it our all to make sure it happens . "
quite ambitious , one might think , to compare their musical breakthrough with the normandy landings , but these aren ’ t empty words .
marek and chris have already enjoyed a taste of success with their previous band atemlos .

they 're not shy about citing big guns like oasis and coldplay as influences ; their music is rock with an emotional slant … and not necessarily always with positive origins .
" all these emotional songs and melodies actually originate from certain feelings of rage , " explains chris , " not necessarily against things which you have done wrong yourself but things that are or were frustrating and which play off each other .
we see ourselves as headed in a direction which will allow us to say we can be free to do what we want . "
their journey to fame and fortune has seen them successfully complete a stint at popcamp , an intense band coaching boot camp organized by the german music council , and put the finishing touches to the recordings for their debut album .

massive amounts of oil are still gushing out and no one , neither bp nor the us government , can do anything about it .
are you astonished that the world 's superpower and one of the biggest oil company 's ca n't stop an oil leak ?
klaus toepfer : definitely .
i am to the utmost surprised .
it is not the only exploration in these depths , there are lots of others and if there is no possibility to stop such a leak then that gives us a totally new impression about the way we produce oil offshore ..
yes , it is more than astonishing that something is licensed when you can not handle a disaster like this .
president barack obama has been harshly criticised for his crisis management with charges that he has acted too late and not strongly enough .
how would you rate obama 's handling of the crisis ?
i think this was really an unexpected development .
that he is doing his utmost right now using not only strong words against bp , but also to integrate all the capacities of the superpower goes withhout saying .
so i would n't criticise him as harshly as he has been criticised by some commentators .
but this is a normal process in an open democratic system and you must be aware of those criticisms and you have to respond to it on a daily basis .
you have to have a clear understanding of the concerns of all the people living in the area most affected by the disaster .
you obviously have to focus on the ecological disaster , but this ecological disaster is linked with huge disaster for the people living in this region who earn their living with tourism , fishing and in other industries .
this serves as an important wake-up call that we now have to hurry up and change our options for producing electricity and energy so that we do n't need to depend any longer on these kinds of risky offshore endeavors .
bp has also been criticised very sharply over its handling and communication of the crisis .
what grade would you give them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toepfer i really believe they lost the control over how to handle the crisis and failed to live up to their responsibilty .
their performance was n't good at all and i am fairly sure that this will have consequences not only within bp , of course it has to start there , but for the industry as a whole .
we have to be aware that this is not only about bp , but there are comparable situations involving others as we saw with the exxon valdez and the disasters off the european coasts .
every crisis is of course an opportunity to learn and change something .
what consequences must be drawn from this crisis now ?
the first and most important consequence is : do your utmost to further develop new energy sources with lower risks .
because if we keep relying on fossil fuels , especially oil , we must recognize that the low-hanging fruits are already harvested and that we will maneuver ourselves into more and more risky and costly situations if we continue to rely on fossil fuels .
so it is high time that we further develop renewable energy and use sun and wind and biomass , geothermal and new energy sources like wave power .
we also have to realize now that the dream that oil is cheap is finally coming to an end .
of course it is easy to point one 's finger at the obama administration and bp for their handling of the crisis .
but are we sure that something like this could n't happen on our own front door in the north sea where there are also oil platforms and drilling ?
have germany and european countries done enough so that something like that ca n't happen there ?
the probability is definitely lower in the north sea .
there are different structures how to operate and handle those risks we saw in the gulf of mexico .
but nobody can be sure that there is zero risk in the north sea and other places in the world as well .
there is a risk , but the probability is much lower .
this oil disaster ranks already as the us ' worst environmental catastrophe in history .
as the un 's former point man on the environment : how bad is this on a global scale ?
this is a problem on a global scale without any doubt .
one should n't exaggerate it , but if you see all the images and pictures one can conclude that this is not just a limited problem in one region of the world , it is a clear signal for the whole world to come to a new assessment about those kinds of drillings and about oil production in general .
it would be a grave mistake to say do n't worry this is only a problem in the gulf of mexico .
klaus toepfer is the founding director of the institute for advanced sustainability studies in potsdam .
from 1998 to 2006 he was executive director of the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- .
prior to that he served as germany 's minister for the env ironment , nature conservation and nuclear safety between 1987 and 1994 .

antonio guterres said during a visit to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic uzbeks have been gathering near the kyrgyz-uzbek border " we urgently need to find a political solution ... the country 's neighbors and the international community must do everything in their power to help the interim kyrgyz government restore peace and stability , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
officials in kyrgyzstan have warned that the ethnic conflict could spread to the country 's north and neighboring countries as aid agencies attempt to cope with the humanitarian crisis in the central asian country .
some 2,000 people have been wounded in the fighting which erupted last thursday , according to official figures .
violence in the southern cities of osh and jalalabad has raised fears over the future stability of the country of 5.3 million , where uzbeks make up 14 percent of the population .
aid groups working overtime uzbekistan has been struggling to deal with a flood of ethnic refugees who crossed the border to escape the unrest .
with around 75,000 refugees already inside uzbekistan after fleeing the southern cities , authorities said they had closed off the border to prevent that number from swelling .
however the office of the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , which has been working to get relief supplies into the central asian countries , told deutsche welle it understood the border has now been reopened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations high commissioner for refugees , antonio guterres , warned of catastrophe " we have this understanding that the border is open .
we understand that yesterday it was closed temporarily for the night and now it is open , " says unhcr spokesperson babar baloch .
" the un high commissioner here in geneva , antonio guterres , has welcomed the uzbek authorities ' decision to open the border and welcome refugees who are seeking asylum in uzbekistan . "
baloch says that the unhcr plans to send six relief planes in total with 240 metric tons of supplies to uzbekistan in the coming days .
he said this would be followed by more aid once the unhcr had established a presence on the ground .
baloch added that the unhcr had been experiencing problems in reaching displaced peoples in areas around osh because of the security situation .
" we had hoped to be able to reach those people .
we have some stocks on the ground at the unhcr warehouse there in osh and we already have been in touch with the icrc -lrb- international committee of the red cross -rrb- to distribute the items we have there , but we understand and we are concerned at the poor security situation in osh and jalalabad and other areas which is impeding aid delivery . "
bildunterschrift : bodies litter the street as houses burn in jalabad military intervention meanwhile , roza otunbayeva , the interim president of kyrgyzstan , said on tuesday that there was no reason for russia to intervene by deploying peacekeepers to the crisis region .
she said the clashes were beginning to wane and that she hoped that her country 's own forces could get the situation under control .
moscow says it considers the violence in southern kyrgyzstan an internal matter for that country and has only sent several hundred troops to defend a russian military base in kyrgyzstan .
both russia and the united states have military installations in the central asian country , with the us using the strategic position as a hub to support its forces in afghanistan .
otunbayeva also said a planned constitutional referendum would go ahead on june 27 .
she was speaking at a press conference after the eu had warned that the violent clashes threatened to derail the country 's reform process .
however this view is not shared by icrc head of operations for central asia and eastern europe , pascale meige wagner , who warned " we 're far from seeing the end of this crisis . "
" we hear extremely worrying stories about people targeted - there is a will to harm and kill in kyrgzystan . "

many thousands of refugees are fleeing the ethnic clashes , with the united nations warning of a possible humanitarian catastrophe . ethnic groups in kyrgyzstan clashed again in overnight battles as the official death toll in the country rose to at least 179 , according to a report by the kyrgyz news agency akipress , quoting the health ministry . the ministry said that it expected the actual number of dead to be much higher . troops were patrolling streets in the city of osh on wednesday morning , following clashes between kyrgyz groups and the uzbek minority .
the number of civilians forced to flee the violence is now put at 275,000 according to the united nations high commission for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- . united nations children 's fund unicef reports that women , children and the elderly make up more than 90 percent of the refugees .
the situation was growing increasingly serious , the head of the unhcr said on wednesday . " what is happening is already a tragedy and it could become a catastrophe . "
antonio guterres said during a visit to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic uzbeks have been gathering near the kyrgyz-uzbek border " we urgently need to find a political solution ... the country 's neighbors and the international community must do everything in their power to help the interim kyrgyz government restore peace and stability , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
officials in kyrgyzstan have warned that the ethnic conflict could spread to the country 's north and neighboring countries as aid agencies attempt to cope with the humanitarian crisis in the central asian country .
some 2,000 people have been wounded in the fighting which erupted last thursday , according to official figures .
violence in the southern cities of osh and jalalabad has raised fears over the future stability of the country of 5.3 million , where uzbeks make up 14 percent of the population .
aid groups working overtime uzbekistan has been struggling to deal with a flood of ethnic refugees who crossed the border to escape the unrest .
with around 75,000 refugees already inside uzbekistan after fleeing the southern cities , authorities said they had closed off the border to prevent that number from swelling .
however the office of the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , which has been working to get relief supplies into the central asian countries , told deutsche welle it understood the border has now been reopened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations high commissioner for refugees , antonio guterres , warned of catastrophe " we have this understanding that the border is open .
we understand that yesterday it was closed temporarily for the night and now it is open , " says unhcr spokesperson babar baloch .
" the un high commissioner here in geneva , antonio guterres , has welcomed the uzbek authorities ' decision to open the border and welcome refugees who are seeking asylum in uzbekistan . "
baloch says that the unhcr plans to send six relief planes in total with 240 metric tons of supplies to uzbekistan in the coming days .
he said this would be followed by more aid once the unhcr had established a presence on the ground .
baloch added that the unhcr had been experiencing problems in reaching displaced peoples in areas around osh because of the security situation .
" we had hoped to be able to reach those people .
we have some stocks on the ground at the unhcr warehouse there in osh and we already have been in touch with the icrc -lrb- international committee of the red cross -rrb- to distribute the items we have there , but we understand and we are concerned at the poor security situation in osh and jalalabad and other areas which is impeding aid delivery . "
bildunterschrift : bodies litter the street as houses burn in jalabad military intervention meanwhile , roza otunbayeva , the interim president of kyrgyzstan , said on tuesday that there was no reason for russia to intervene by deploying peacekeepers to the crisis region .
she said the clashes were beginning to wane and that she hoped that her country 's own forces could get the situation under control .
moscow says it considers the violence in southern kyrgyzstan an internal matter for that country and has only sent several hundred troops to defend a russian military base in kyrgyzstan .
both russia and the united states have military installations in the central asian country , with the us using the strategic position as a hub to support its forces in afghanistan .
otunbayeva also said a planned constitutional referendum would go ahead on june 27 .
she was speaking at a press conference after the eu had warned that the violent clashes threatened to derail the country 's reform process .
however this view is not shared by icrc head of operations for central asia and eastern europe , pascale meige wagner , who warned " we 're far from seeing the end of this crisis . "
" we hear extremely worrying stories about people targeted - there is a will to harm and kill in kyrgzystan . "

but the band do have one thing in common with the world ’ s most famous book : a knowledge that big things are going to happen . abel & cain 's lead singer chris blöcher is sure that pretty soon there 'll come a time when stadium crowds are singing along to their songs .
" basically we ’ re ready for our time , our d-day in the music scene if you like , " he said , " that ’ s the only thing we want to do and we 're giving it our all to make sure it happens . "
quite ambitious , one might think , to compare their musical breakthrough with the normandy landings , but these aren ’ t empty words .
marek and chris have already enjoyed a taste of success with their previous band atemlos .
they scored three sizable chart hits , shot a bunch of music videos and were even featured on german music tv channel viva .
but despite their burgeoning popularity , they decided the direction the band was heading in just was n't them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : front man chris onstage a knack for pathos they let the atemlos project fold and switched to singing in english with the formation of abel & cain .
they 're not shy about citing big guns like oasis and coldplay as influences ; their music is rock with an emotional slant … and not necessarily always with positive origins .
" all these emotional songs and melodies actually originate from certain feelings of rage , " explains chris , " not necessarily against things which you have done wrong yourself but things that are or were frustrating and which play off each other .
we see ourselves as headed in a direction which will allow us to say we can be free to do what we want . "
their journey to fame and fortune has seen them successfully complete a stint at popcamp , an intense band coaching boot camp organized by the german music council , and put the finishing touches to the recordings for their debut album .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popcamp is a high-level band coaching project sponsored by the german music council all set for the international market chris is actually dreaming of a future where he isn ’ t chained to germany : " i 'd like to be somewhere where no one knows who i am , where i do n't know anyone , where i 'd never know what might happen when i walk around the corner .
that ’ s what i want . "
in order to accomplish that , he 's ditched the idea of singing in german with the view that english songs fare better internationally than german ones .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : today the clubs , tomorrow the stadiums ?
the five year plan abel & cain are n't dreaming of success ; as far as the four guys from düsseldorf are concerned , they 're already convinced it 's going to happen and that this is the right time .
at the moment , they 're all working flat out towards this goal so much so that chris knows exactly where he sees the band in five years ' time .
" i want to see the music we make mature and to see it develop into something round and perfect , " he adds , " i can picture way more live shows , touring our third album . i can really see us doing well in this business .
in fact , i can ’ t imagine anything else . "

that is the main finding of a new report presented by the german education ministry . more evidence of the desperate state of germany 's education system was revealed on wednesday , with the pre-publication of statistics from a new " education in germany " report .
according to the report , which is to be presented thursday by the german education ministry and the state conference on education , an assembly of germany 's state education ministers , 17 percent of young germans aged between 20 and 30 have no vocational qualification and are no longer in the education system .
this marks a new high - in 2007 , the figure was still at 15.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezdemir is convinced the problems are endemic the situation is particularly dire among young people with an immigrant background , 30 percent of whom have no formal training and no prospect of achieving further qualifications .
in the face of increasing pressures in the job market , the researchers warned that germany could be facing a long-term unemployment problem for those without formal qualifications .
one forecast predicts that the supply of unqualified workers would exceed the number of jobs in this sector by some 1.3 million for the next 15 years .
for cem oezdemir , education spokesman for the green party , the deficits in germany 's system are appalling .
" we 're talking about a sort of risk-group that leaves school lacking basic reading , writing and arithmetic skills - they are functionally illiterate , " he told deutsche welle .
no surprises problems have been endemic for years , and the report 's findings provide few surprises for those concerned with german education .
stephanie odenwald , director for vocational training at the educational workers ' union gew , said , " it 's not a surprise - everyone who knows the education system has known this problem for years . "
odenwald can also identify one of the main causes of the problem : " it is mainly the fault of the misguided development of this massive transitional system , where young people leave school and do n't get into job training programs and instead get put into these waiting loops , or ' job preparation schemes ' as they are known .
there is a very wide body of opinion that says we need to get rid of this system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with an immigrant background are particularly disadvantaged this transitional system has often been blamed for leaving many of germany 's young people in limbo after leaving school , but oezdemir says that the problems are much deeper .

" the interim system is just one element of it . "
the sacred cow gymnasium the new report is one of many that have indirectly brought attention to the injustices in germany 's three-tiered school system , which divides students according to ability into one of three different schools after the fourth grade - these are the hauptschule , the realschule and the elite gymnasium .
international comparisons like the pisa studies have highlighted the social inequalities that are caused by this system .
the report shows that hauptschule students continue to have problems finding job training places , even though the competition for them is said to be decreasing .
as far as oezdemir is concerned , germany 's conservative government resists reform because it is clinging to the gymnasium .
" there really is n't a recognition problem , " he says .
" these studies always come out with similar results .
there is an application problem .
we know the problems , but the politicians get bogged down in financial questions , and the taboo of the gymnasium .

now , according to india 's official press information bureau , afghanistan has invited india to invest in its mining sector , particularly in mining iron ore , copper , gold and coal . during a visit to india on tuesday , afghanistan 's mines minister wahidullah shahrani also sought india 's know-how in the field of mineral exploration .

that is the main finding of a new report presented by the german education ministry . more evidence of the desperate state of germany 's education system was revealed on wednesday , with the pre-publication of statistics from a new " education in germany " report .
according to the report , which is to be presented thursday by the german education ministry and the state conference on education , an assembly of germany 's state education ministers , 17 percent of young germans aged between 20 and 30 have no vocational qualification and are no longer in the education system .
this marks a new high - in 2007 , the figure was still at 15.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezdemir is convinced the problems are endemic the situation is particularly dire among young people with an immigrant background , 30 percent of whom have no formal training and no prospect of achieving further qualifications .
in the face of increasing pressures in the job market , the researchers warned that germany could be facing a long-term unemployment problem for those without formal qualifications .
one forecast predicts that the supply of unqualified workers would exceed the number of jobs in this sector by some 1.3 million for the next 15 years .
for cem oezdemir , education spokesman for the green party , the deficits in germany 's system are appalling .
" we 're talking about a sort of risk-group that leaves school lacking basic reading , writing and arithmetic skills - they are functionally illiterate , " he told deutsche welle .
no surprises problems have been endemic for years , and the report 's findings provide few surprises for those concerned with german education .
stephanie odenwald , director for vocational training at the educational workers ' union gew , said , " it 's not a surprise - everyone who knows the education system has known this problem for years . "
odenwald can also identify one of the main causes of the problem : " it is mainly the fault of the misguided development of this massive transitional system , where young people leave school and do n't get into job training programs and instead get put into these waiting loops , or ' job preparation schemes ' as they are known .
there is a very wide body of opinion that says we need to get rid of this system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with an immigrant background are particularly disadvantaged this transitional system has often been blamed for leaving many of germany 's young people in limbo after leaving school , but oezdemir says that the problems are much deeper .
" what this study makes clear is that we need to question our whole education system - from kindergarten all the way to university , " he said .
" the interim system is just one element of it . "
the sacred cow gymnasium the new report is one of many that have indirectly brought attention to the injustices in germany 's three-tiered school system , which divides students according to ability into one of three different schools after the fourth grade - these are the hauptschule , the realschule and the elite gymnasium .
international comparisons like the pisa studies have highlighted the social inequalities that are caused by this system .
the report shows that hauptschule students continue to have problems finding job training places , even though the competition for them is said to be decreasing .
as far as oezdemir is concerned , germany 's conservative government resists reform because it is clinging to the gymnasium .
" there really is n't a recognition problem , " he says .
" these studies always come out with similar results .
there is an application problem .
we know the problems , but the politicians get bogged down in financial questions , and the taboo of the gymnasium .
the schools need to fit our children , not the other way round . "

" there really is n't a recognition problem , " he says .
" these studies always come out with similar results .
there is an application problem .
we know the problems , but the politicians get bogged down in financial questions , and the taboo of the gymnasium .
the schools need to fit our children , not the other way round . "

although food is already in short supply there , local farmers are reluctant to plant new crop varieties that promise better yields . in drought-prone regions of africa , people are often bitterly poor and food is scarce .
unfortunately , the inhabitants of those regions are the very people who , experts say , will be the first to suffer the consequences of climate change .
while droughts used to occur in eastern africa every seven years , they now occur almost every other year .
this negatively impacts food output in the region .
one organization working to improve food security in africa is the coalition for african rice development , which wants to drastically reduce the continent 's reliance on expensive rice imports .
it hopes to develop resilient new rice varieties and distribute them to smallholder farmers , thereby doubling rice production to 28 million tons per annum by the year 2018 .
however , not all farmers are willing to plant modified seeds , whether they be rice , maize or any another crop .
farmers resist change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smallholder maize farms in africa are suffering from less rainfall and higher temperatures christina sabini runs a small farm near morogoro , tanzania with her husband , and says less rain and more heat have reduced harvests during recent years .
like other farmers in the region , sabini says she has no choice but to adapt to the changing climate .
last year , she was offered new tan250 maize seeds , which were researched and tested in kenya and zimbabwe .
" these seeds are better because they also survive droughts , and they do provide good yields .
even without using fertilizer , i can reap good maize , " she said .
sabini was one of the few regional farmers who chose to accept the seeds , and she believes she made the right decision .
others were more conservative and continued using the traditional varieties .
according to cynthia awuor , a climate expert with the non-governmental organization care in kenya , developing drought-resistant seeds is only half the challenge faced by those whose want to curb world hunger by increasing crop yields .
convincing farmers to voluntarily change their habits and plant the new seeds can be very difficult .
" there 's much more exploration into drought tolerant species of maize as well as other crops .
at the same time , we are trying to promote crop varieties and seed varieties that were traditionally drought tolerant .
so we 're encouraging farmers to go into planting more and more sorghum , for example , and cassava , which are traditionally drought tolerant types of crops , " awuor told deutsche welle .
modified crops are slow to catch on but awuor and her organization are not the first to encounter resistance to modified crop varieties .
in the 1990 's , scientists cross bred a high-yield variety of asian rice with a stress-resistant african one .
the result was nerica , tough and locally adapted rice best suited for the highland or dry land environments which account for about 70 percent of africa 's rice farms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased food production may save lives as climate change progresses many farmers have been able to double their harvests , thanks to the new rice , but nerica did n't catch on until more than 80 varieties and thousands of lines were developed to cater to regions in 20 african countries .
thomas yanga works for the united nation 's world food program , where he is responsible for west africa .
he is well aware of the attitudes of farmers in his home country of cameroon .
" i know from my own village that the people are very , very attached to the taste of certain commodities .
and for them the taste is more important than anything else .
any new variety that does not give them the same taste , they will reject , " he told deutsche welle .
monty jones from sierra leone was awarded the world food prize six years ago for his role in developing nerica .
while he is proud of the rich harvest reaped from the new rice variety , he is worried about the impact of climate change in the future .
" at a certain level of distress – whether it 's drought , whether it 's flooding , whether it 's salinity – every material will break down .
basically , what we can do is to increase the level of resistance or tolerance to these problems , " he told deutsche welle .

cologne-based deg , part of the kfw banking group , lead the realization of the project .
bruno wenn , chairman of the board of management at deg will present this flagship project at the deutsche welle global media forum .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
within the framework of german development work , deg is responsible for financing investments of private companies for projects in developing and transition countries .
an example from the realm of climate change is the olkaria iii geothermal plant in kenya .
wenn says that the climate change debate has been shaped by the role of the public sector .
“ the participation of the private sector has mostly been missing in public discussions until now , ” he says .
for olkaria iii , 105 million dollars -lrb- us -rrb- were provided by outside financing .
deg ’ s requirements : the project must be “ operational , profitable , environmental and socially acceptable ” .
wenn is convinced that olkaria iii can be a glowing example for making climate projects profitable .
however , he also says that the private infrastructures that exist in developing countries are a major challenge .
when working on olkaria iii , deg benefited from kfw ’ s cooperation with the state-run power company in kenya , in order to get more investors on board .
wenn states that geothermal energy isn ’ t a futuristic vision .
“ the capacity in 2008 was just behind solar energy worldwide .
there is a lot of potential in the americas and in asia , ” says wenn .
“ the usa is currently the largest consumer of geothermal energy , followed by the philippines , indonesia and mexico . ”
it could also be important in africa .
“ olkaria iii is like the core in africa for further development in the region and a big step forward . ”
in bonn , wenn will make it clear that all stakeholders must reach a “ long-term , global agreement regarding the general conditions about climate change and the prevention of future greenhouse gas emissions . ”
more than 50 individual events in 2010 , the deutsche welle global media forum once again offers more than 50 events including podium discussions and workshops , interactive presentations and exhibitions , networking and interesting side events .
it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .
deutsche welle is cooperating with many different organizations for this interdisciplinary conference , including the unesco , the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , the international human dimensions program on global environmental change -lrb- un ihdp / essp -rrb- , eu commission and the world bank , the wuppertal institute , world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- , nabu and the climate alliance , the institute for world business kiel , german development institute -lrb- die -rrb- , the center for development research -lrb- zef -rrb- and many others .
co-host of the deutsche welle global media forum is the foundation for international dialogue of the sparkasse in bonn .
the convention is also supported by germany ’ s federal foreign office , the family , women and integration ministry of the german state of north rhine-westphalia , european funds for regional development , the city of bonn , dhl , the ksb group and faber-castell .

gm also said that no further layoffs at opel were on the cards . us auto giant general motors has dropped its request for financial backing from european governments for its carmaker opel , saying it would restructure its european subsidiary itself .
further layoffs at opel have also been shelved .
opel said in a statement that it laid blame for the back flip on the lengthy process of obtaining government loan guarantees from germany , britain , spain , poland , austria and belgium - in which it employs some 48,000 workers altogether .
britain and spain had offered loan guarantees , but gm would now do without any government help .
" the validity and reasons for requesting government guarantees have ... not changed but the process has proven to be much more complex and longer than anticipated , " the firm said in a statement .
" gm 's recently improved financial strength has also been a catalyst for making this decision . "
the move comes as a surprise after gm for months insisted it needed european governments to pitch in to restructure opel .
no more layoffs opel said there would be no layoffs or plant closures beyond those already announced at the beginning of this year .
those measures called for opel to lose 8,300 workers in europe and close a plant in belgium .
gm had asked the european governments for 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees to restructure opel .
last week , germany , home to 23,000 opel employees , categorically ruled out providing its share of the guarantee - estimated at 1.1 billion euros - saying that gm had enough money of its own .
however , the four german states which have opel plants were looking at whether they could step in and at least partly fill the gap .
chief executive nick reilly has been pushing for a plan to invest 11 billion euros in the company until 2014 , updating 80 per cent of the opel model range .

earlier , in group h , switzerland shocked spain 1-0 , while chile overcame honduras by the same score line . uruguay have beaten south africa 3-0 in the second round of group a games at the world cup , pushing the south americans up to four points and leaving bafana bafana languishing on one point .
south africa started the game with energy and tight passing , taking it to the uruguayan defense .
however the dominant possession did n't pay dividends for the hosts , when uruguay scored in the 23rd minute through a looping shot from outside the box by atletico madrid striker diego forlan .
the ball tucked under the crossbar and into the back of the net , leaving south african keeper itumeleng khune helpless .
the goal did n't have a huge impact on south africa 's composure , but from that point onwards the possession balanced out and uruguay was allowed more time in their attacking third .
uruguay started the second half a different team , keeping the south african defense under pressure for the opening 15 minutes .
south africa seemed somewhat lackluster with the ball and were unable to threaten their opponent 's goal until the 65th minute after a cross from the right by siboniso gaxa to the near post met katlego mphela 's head , though the forward pushed the ball wide .
the death knell for south africa came in the 76th minute when khune was red carded for bringing down ajax striker luis suarez in the box after he was clear on goal .
forlan coolly smashed home the resultant penalty kick .
uruguay made it 3-0 with a close-range header from alvaro pereira deep in injury time from a suarez cross .
south africa must now hope for a win next tuesday against france if they are to have any hope of progressing to the round of 16 .
shock in nelspruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland upset spain , who were title favorites in wednesday 's afternoon match , european title holders spain were toppled in their first world cup match after going down 1-0 in a shock loss to ottmar hitzfeld ’ s switzerland .
the swiss took the lead in the 52nd minute through a scrappy goal against the run of play from gelson fernandes , who picked up a loose ball after spanish keeper iker casillas collided with eren derdiyok in the box .
xavi alonso went closest to equalizing for the spaniards in the 70th minute when his shot from the edge of the box rebounded off the crossbar .
switzerland nearly went 2-0 up four minutes later when derdiyok weaved past two men in the box and struck the right post after a deft shot with the outside of his right boot .
the victory is the first for switzerland over spain in 19 meetings and represents by far the greatest upset so far in the world cup in south africa .
spain dominated possession in the first 45 minutes , getting most of their team behind the ball .
the best chance fell to gerard pique , who cut back inside swiss defender stephane grichting but saw his shot rebound off the legs of keeper diego benaglio .
despite showing sparks of brilliance with the ball , spain rarely threatened during the half , while switzerland , too , lacked any real scoring opportunities .
vicente del bosque 's spain , which , going into the tournament , was among the teams most favored to lift the world cup , were expected to come away with all three points against switzerland .

striker jean beausejour bagged the only goal of the game .
in a game which it dominated , chile were unlucky not to extend their lead after man-of-the-match beausejour 's 34th minute strike .
the goal followed some slick passing in the honduran box which created space for mauricio isla on the right flank to get a low cross in at the near post , which was turned in by the mexico-based beausejour .
chile defender waldo ponce came forward for a free kick midway through the second half and should have doubled the lead only for veteran goalie noel valladares to parry away a diving point-blank header .
midfielder jorge valdivia had another chance at the goal 15 minutes from full-time , but was correctly flagged offside as the " killer " second goal continued to elude chile .

earlier , in group h , switzerland shocked spain 1-0 , while chile overcame honduras by the same score line . uruguay have beaten south africa 3-0 in the second round of group a games at the world cup , pushing the south americans up to four points and leaving bafana bafana languishing on one point .
south africa started the game with energy and tight passing , taking it to the uruguayan defense .
however the dominant possession did n't pay dividends for the hosts , when uruguay scored in the 23rd minute through a looping shot from outside the box by atletico madrid striker diego forlan .
the ball tucked under the crossbar and into the back of the net , leaving south african keeper itumeleng khune helpless .
the goal did n't have a huge impact on south africa 's composure , but from that point onwards the possession balanced out and uruguay was allowed more time in their attacking third .
uruguay started the second half a different team , keeping the south african defense under pressure for the opening 15 minutes .
south africa seemed somewhat lackluster with the ball and were unable to threaten their opponent 's goal until the 65th minute after a cross from the right by siboniso gaxa to the near post met katlego mphela 's head , though the forward pushed the ball wide .
the death knell for south africa came in the 76th minute when khune was red carded for bringing down ajax striker luis suarez in the box after he was clear on goal .
forlan coolly smashed home the resultant penalty kick .
uruguay made it 3-0 with a close-range header from alvaro pereira deep in injury time from a suarez cross .
south africa must now hope for a win next tuesday against france if they are to have any hope of progressing to the round of 16 .
shock in nelspruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland upset spain , who were title favorites in wednesday 's afternoon match , european title holders spain were toppled in their first world cup match after going down 1-0 in a shock loss to ottmar hitzfeld ’ s switzerland .
the swiss took the lead in the 52nd minute through a scrappy goal against the run of play from gelson fernandes , who picked up a loose ball after spanish keeper iker casillas collided with eren derdiyok in the box .
xavi alonso went closest to equalizing for the spaniards in the 70th minute when his shot from the edge of the box rebounded off the crossbar .
switzerland nearly went 2-0 up four minutes later when derdiyok weaved past two men in the box and struck the right post after a deft shot with the outside of his right boot .
the victory is the first for switzerland over spain in 19 meetings and represents by far the greatest upset so far in the world cup in south africa .
spain dominated possession in the first 45 minutes , getting most of their team behind the ball .
the best chance fell to gerard pique , who cut back inside swiss defender stephane grichting but saw his shot rebound off the legs of keeper diego benaglio .
despite showing sparks of brilliance with the ball , spain rarely threatened during the half , while switzerland , too , lacked any real scoring opportunities .
vicente del bosque 's spain , which , going into the tournament , was among the teams most favored to lift the world cup , were expected to come away with all three points against switzerland .
victory after 48 years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beausejour -lrb- in red -rrb- shoots to score past honduras goalkeeper noel valladares in the day 's opening group h match , chile ended a 48-year winless streak in the world cup by overcoming honduras 1-0 at mbombela stadium in nelspruit .
striker jean beausejour bagged the only goal of the game .
in a game which it dominated , chile were unlucky not to extend their lead after man-of-the-match beausejour 's 34th minute strike .
the goal followed some slick passing in the honduran box which created space for mauricio isla on the right flank to get a low cross in at the near post , which was turned in by the mexico-based beausejour .
chile defender waldo ponce came forward for a free kick midway through the second half and should have doubled the lead only for veteran goalie noel valladares to parry away a diving point-blank header .
midfielder jorge valdivia had another chance at the goal 15 minutes from full-time , but was correctly flagged offside as the " killer " second goal continued to elude chile .

mineral resources worth about a trillion dollars have been found in afghanistan .
these include gold , iron , cobalt and lithium . the report about the pentagon 's huge afghan mineral finds and their economic potential has attracted a lot of attention in afghanistan .
many are upbeat about it .
abdurrahman ashraf , the advisor to president hamid karzai on mining issues , says that his government will conduct an in-depth investigation to verify the information .
" we have been given data which are necessary for the mining of the resources .
we will work with that , " he says .
" we will take samples on the ground and find out the mineral content of various deposits .

during the occupation of afghanistan in the 1980s , soviet geologists had already explored the soil and collected data .
after the withdrawal of the red army , afghan geologists hid the maps which their soviet colleagues had left behind .
the information remained under wraps until the western forces drove the taliban out of kabul in 2001 . the white house in washington seemed to have not known about the mineral resources until recently , when an internal memo by the us department of defense said the value of the deposits in afghanistan was about a trillion dollars .

economist sayhoon believes there could be other motives as well : " the us is warning us afghans and suggesting to us to consider exploiting and using these mineral resources .

" moreover , our generation has not the right to sell everything . "
ashraf also suggests that afghans might prefer to sell the valuable mineral resources to china or india rather than to western buyers . experts however see such a statement as an attempt by the kabul government to use afghanistan 's mineral resources as an asset and to pit the west , china and india against each other - while keeping all options open . authors : arif farahmand , cem sey / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mineral resources worth about a trillion dollars have been found in afghanistan .
these include gold , iron , cobalt and lithium . the report about the pentagon 's huge afghan mineral finds and their economic potential has attracted a lot of attention in afghanistan .
many are upbeat about it .
abdurrahman ashraf , the advisor to president hamid karzai on mining issues , says that his government will conduct an in-depth investigation to verify the information .
" we have been given data which are necessary for the mining of the resources .
we will work with that , " he says .
" we will take samples on the ground and find out the mineral content of various deposits .
then we can say which deposits are economically worthwhile and which are not . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president karzai 's government is conducting an investigation into the mineral deposits the information is not ' new ' the us government 's supposedly new information about the mineral riches is in fact not that new .
during the occupation of afghanistan in the 1980s , soviet geologists had already explored the soil and collected data .
after the withdrawal of the red army , afghan geologists hid the maps which their soviet colleagues had left behind .
the information remained under wraps until the western forces drove the taliban out of kabul in 2001 . the white house in washington seemed to have not known about the mineral resources until recently , when an internal memo by the us department of defense said the value of the deposits in afghanistan was about a trillion dollars .

some other sources even speak of a value of up to six trillion dollars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many fear that the taliban could intensify their insurgency after the recent revelations timing of the report experts in kabul wonder why washington has made this information public now .
some believe that the white house is trying to show us citizens that their soldiers are not fighting in vain , and that a lot of money is involved here .
economist sayhoon believes there could be other motives as well : " the us is warning us afghans and suggesting to us to consider exploiting and using these mineral resources .

" the mining and sale of these mineral resources require special expertise , which we do not have right now , " he says .
" moreover , our generation has not the right to sell everything . "
ashraf also suggests that afghans might prefer to sell the valuable mineral resources to china or india rather than to western buyers . experts however see such a statement as an attempt by the kabul government to use afghanistan 's mineral resources as an asset and to pit the west , china and india against each other - while keeping all options open . authors : arif farahmand , cem sey / du editor : thomas baerthlein send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

cologne-based deg , part of the kfw banking group , lead the realization of the project .
bruno wenn , chairman of the board of management at deg will present this flagship project at the deutsche welle global media forum .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
within the framework of german development work , deg is responsible for financing investments of private companies for projects in developing and transition countries .
an example from the realm of climate change is the olkaria iii geothermal plant in kenya .
wenn says that the climate change debate has been shaped by the role of the public sector .
“ the participation of the private sector has mostly been missing in public discussions until now , ” he says .
for olkaria iii , 105 million dollars -lrb- us -rrb- were provided by outside financing .
deg ’ s requirements : the project must be “ operational , profitable , environmental and socially acceptable ” .
wenn is convinced that olkaria iii can be a glowing example for making climate projects profitable .
however , he also says that the private infrastructures that exist in developing countries are a major challenge .
when working on olkaria iii , deg benefited from kfw ’ s cooperation with the state-run power company in kenya , in order to get more investors on board .
wenn states that geothermal energy isn ’ t a futuristic vision .
“ the capacity in 2008 was just behind solar energy worldwide .
there is a lot of potential in the americas and in asia , ” says wenn .
“ the usa is currently the largest consumer of geothermal energy , followed by the philippines , indonesia and mexico . ”
it could also be important in africa .
“ olkaria iii is like the core in africa for further development in the region and a big step forward . ”

cologne-based deg , part of the kfw banking group , lead the realization of the project .
bruno wenn , chairman of the board of management at deg will present this flagship project at the deutsche welle global media forum .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
within the framework of german development work , deg is responsible for financing investments of private companies for projects in developing and transition countries .
an example from the realm of climate change is the olkaria iii geothermal plant in kenya .
wenn says that the climate change debate has been shaped by the role of the public sector .
“ the participation of the private sector has mostly been missing in public discussions until now , ” he says .
for olkaria iii , 105 million dollars -lrb- us -rrb- were provided by outside financing .
deg ’ s requirements : the project must be “ operational , profitable , environmental and socially acceptable ” .
wenn is convinced that olkaria iii can be a glowing example for making climate projects profitable .
however , he also says that the private infrastructures that exist in developing countries are a major challenge .
when working on olkaria iii , deg benefited from kfw ’ s cooperation with the state-run power company in kenya , in order to get more investors on board .
wenn states that geothermal energy isn ’ t a futuristic vision .
“ the capacity in 2008 was just behind solar energy worldwide .
there is a lot of potential in the americas and in asia , ” says wenn .
“ the usa is currently the largest consumer of geothermal energy , followed by the philippines , indonesia and mexico . ”
it could also be important in africa .
“ olkaria iii is like the core in africa for further development in the region and a big step forward . ”
in bonn , wenn will make it clear that all stakeholders must reach a “ long-term , global agreement regarding the general conditions about climate change and the prevention of future greenhouse gas emissions . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 16.06.2010 installation artist christo says freedom is the enemy of possession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christo and wife jeanne-claude worked together for decades christo 's installations are often larger than life : a huge sheet covering the german parliament or islands surrounded by floating fabric .
the artist talked with deutsche welle about some of the big ideas behind them . contemporary installation artist christo turns 75 this week , less than a year after the loss of his wife and artistic partner jeanne-claude .
deutsche welle spoke with christo about how he is moving forward with his work and what he thinks about its reception .
two museums in germany - the kunsthalle wuerth and the max ernst museum in bruehl - are currently displaying some of his works .
deutsche welle : you had such a symbiotic relationship with jeanne-claude .
how is it for you to continue work now on the projects you had planned together ?
christo : we always knew that one of us would be the first to go , and we 've known that for almost the last 50 years .
ever since we met in 1958 , we 've always traveled in separate planes so that one of us would be able to finish the work we started .
so , everything was in some way already prepared .
these projects take so long to get permission and to realize that we always envisioned this was possible .
many people struggle to understand the concept that you do n't work for money .
what does it say about our society that people have so much trouble grasping that you do art simply to create new art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wrapped reichstag " -lrb- 1995 -rrb- was realized 24 years after its conception this relates to the way i was brought up and educated in bulgaria under communism .
basically , the projects deal in large part with freedom .
of course , i do make money by selling the preparatory drawings and studies for the projects .
on paper , i put down my visions , jeanne-claude 's visions , our visions .
i also produce a variety of tangible goods to create the funds necessary to build projects that can not be bought and can not be owned - even jeanne-claude and i do n't own them .
the projects are about freedom .
freedom is the enemy of possession , and possession is equal to permanence .
you know , humans like to be in the presence of things that are unique like they are - things that wo n't happen again .
the projects have a quality of fragility and tenderness , like our own lives or our own childhood .
they can not be substituted or repeated .
but how much of a problem do you think our society has in understanding what you 're trying to do with your work ?
i would never think about that myself .
we like to build these projects because we enjoy it for ourselves , like any true artist .
any artist - an abstract painter , a watercolorist , whoever - enjoys and lives to do the work .
the projects begin from an almost visceral desire to realize something because you think it 's beautiful .
if somebody likes the work , it 's almost like a bonus - an additional dimension .
these projects deal with a very wide variety of aesthetic dimensions .
a 3-d work of art is different from a painting with a flat surface .
with a sculpture , you can move around it , you perceive the volume and dimensions .
but all of that space is entirely designed by the artist , who exercises an absurd amount of control over the space .
now , there 's another space we think very little about .
the moment you walk out of your home , somebody else designed the sidewalk , the roads and the lights .
basically 24 hours a day , we 're in a highly planned space that we do n't even think about .
in our work , we more or less borrow that space and create a gentle disturbance for a few days .
by doing so , we inherit everything inherent to that space , and it becomes a part of the work of art .
you just turned 75 .
that 's significant in many ways , is n't it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the gates " -lrb- 2005 -rrb- in new york city cost $ 21 million , raised entirely by the artists at least i 'm still alive -lrb- laughs -rrb- - but i really do n't think about that .
i 've lived in the same building for 46 years .
i climb 90 steps about 15 times a day - i do n't have an elevator .
do you perhaps want to do something permanent at this stage in your life ?
i do a lot of things that are permanent - a lot of drawings , sketches , collages , and sculptures .
they 're permanent and in museums .
i 'm not against the idea of things existing permanently .
for instance , each time a big project is finished and removed , it has its own documentation exhibition that tells the story of the project .
there are scale models , cables , fabric , and samples .
these exhibitions do not substitute for the projects .
they 're about the projects .
but through them , you should see connections to all the works - they 're connected , they 're not separate .
the reality of these large projects is that there are so many different levels of perception involved .
i think this is the body of our work together - it can not be separate .

but dams and manmade reservoirs also encroach upon humans , wildlife and natural habitats .
a company based in south western germany that specializes in making high-performance pumps is currently testing a solution that can use the power of the river without affecting its ecosystem .
dieter-heinz hellmann , member of the ksb board of management , will present the operating principle of the new river turbine at this year ’ s deutsche welle global media forum in bonn , germany .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
ksb engineers turned a basic principle on its head .
bchanging the direction of flow , a pump can be used as a turbine and vice versa .
in other words , by introducing flow to a pump propeller in reverse , it begins rotating and turns the pump into a turbine .

initial tests have shown that the ksb turbine neither interferes with the river ’ s ecosystem nor impedes the migratory routes of fish .

the artist talked with deutsche welle about some of the big ideas behind them . contemporary installation artist christo turns 75 this week , less than a year after the loss of his wife and artistic partner jeanne-claude .
deutsche welle spoke with christo about how he is moving forward with his work and what he thinks about its reception .
two museums in germany - the kunsthalle wuerth and the max ernst museum in bruehl - are currently displaying some of his works .
deutsche welle : you had such a symbiotic relationship with jeanne-claude .
how is it for you to continue work now on the projects you had planned together ?
christo : we always knew that one of us would be the first to go , and we 've known that for almost the last 50 years .
ever since we met in 1958 , we 've always traveled in separate planes so that one of us would be able to finish the work we started .
so , everything was in some way already prepared .
these projects take so long to get permission and to realize that we always envisioned this was possible .
many people struggle to understand the concept that you do n't work for money .
what does it say about our society that people have so much trouble grasping that you do art simply to create new art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wrapped reichstag " -lrb- 1995 -rrb- was realized 24 years after its conception this relates to the way i was brought up and educated in bulgaria under communism .
basically , the projects deal in large part with freedom .
of course , i do make money by selling the preparatory drawings and studies for the projects .
on paper , i put down my visions , jeanne-claude 's visions , our visions .
i also produce a variety of tangible goods to create the funds necessary to build projects that can not be bought and can not be owned - even jeanne-claude and i do n't own them .
the projects are about freedom .
freedom is the enemy of possession , and possession is equal to permanence .
you know , humans like to be in the presence of things that are unique like they are - things that wo n't happen again .
the projects have a quality of fragility and tenderness , like our own lives or our own childhood .
they can not be substituted or repeated .
but how much of a problem do you think our society has in understanding what you 're trying to do with your work ?
i would never think about that myself .
we like to build these projects because we enjoy it for ourselves , like any true artist .
any artist - an abstract painter , a watercolorist , whoever - enjoys and lives to do the work .
the projects begin from an almost visceral desire to realize something because you think it 's beautiful .
if somebody likes the work , it 's almost like a bonus - an additional dimension .
these projects deal with a very wide variety of aesthetic dimensions .
a 3-d work of art is different from a painting with a flat surface .
with a sculpture , you can move around it , you perceive the volume and dimensions .
but all of that space is entirely designed by the artist , who exercises an absurd amount of control over the space .
now , there 's another space we think very little about .
the moment you walk out of your home , somebody else designed the sidewalk , the roads and the lights .
basically 24 hours a day , we 're in a highly planned space that we do n't even think about .
in our work , we more or less borrow that space and create a gentle disturbance for a few days .
by doing so , we inherit everything inherent to that space , and it becomes a part of the work of art .
you just turned 75 .
that 's significant in many ways , is n't it ?

i 've lived in the same building for 46 years .
i climb 90 steps about 15 times a day - i do n't have an elevator .
do you perhaps want to do something permanent at this stage in your life ?
i do a lot of things that are permanent - a lot of drawings , sketches , collages , and sculptures .
they 're permanent and in museums .
i 'm not against the idea of things existing permanently .
for instance , each time a big project is finished and removed , it has its own documentation exhibition that tells the story of the project .
there are scale models , cables , fabric , and samples .
these exhibitions do not substitute for the projects .
they 're about the projects .
but through them , you should see connections to all the works - they 're connected , they 're not separate .
the reality of these large projects is that there are so many different levels of perception involved .
i think this is the body of our work together - it can not be separate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de development policy -pipe- 16.06.2010 newer crop varieties could check world hunger but meet with resistance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nerica rice can thrive in drought-prone environments drought-prone regions of africa are likely to be hard-hit as climate change continues .
although food is already in short supply there , local farmers are reluctant to plant new crop varieties that promise better yields . in drought-prone regions of africa , people are often bitterly poor and food is scarce .
unfortunately , the inhabitants of those regions are the very people who , experts say , will be the first to suffer the consequences of climate change .
while droughts used to occur in eastern africa every seven years , they now occur almost every other year .
this negatively impacts food output in the region .
one organization working to improve food security in africa is the coalition for african rice development , which wants to drastically reduce the continent 's reliance on expensive rice imports .
it hopes to develop resilient new rice varieties and distribute them to smallholder farmers , thereby doubling rice production to 28 million tons per annum by the year 2018 .
however , not all farmers are willing to plant modified seeds , whether they be rice , maize or any another crop .
farmers resist change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smallholder maize farms in africa are suffering from less rainfall and higher temperatures christina sabini runs a small farm near morogoro , tanzania with her husband , and says less rain and more heat have reduced harvests during recent years .
like other farmers in the region , sabini says she has no choice but to adapt to the changing climate .
last year , she was offered new tan250 maize seeds , which were researched and tested in kenya and zimbabwe .
" these seeds are better because they also survive droughts , and they do provide good yields .
even without using fertilizer , i can reap good maize , " she said .
sabini was one of the few regional farmers who chose to accept the seeds , and she believes she made the right decision .
others were more conservative and continued using the traditional varieties .
according to cynthia awuor , a climate expert with the non-governmental organization care in kenya , developing drought-resistant seeds is only half the challenge faced by those whose want to curb world hunger by increasing crop yields .
convincing farmers to voluntarily change their habits and plant the new seeds can be very difficult .
" there 's much more exploration into drought tolerant species of maize as well as other crops .
at the same time , we are trying to promote crop varieties and seed varieties that were traditionally drought tolerant .
so we 're encouraging farmers to go into planting more and more sorghum , for example , and cassava , which are traditionally drought tolerant types of crops , " awuor told deutsche welle .
modified crops are slow to catch on but awuor and her organization are not the first to encounter resistance to modified crop varieties .
in the 1990 's , scientists cross bred a high-yield variety of asian rice with a stress-resistant african one .
the result was nerica , tough and locally adapted rice best suited for the highland or dry land environments which account for about 70 percent of africa 's rice farms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : increased food production may save lives as climate change progresses many farmers have been able to double their harvests , thanks to the new rice , but nerica did n't catch on until more than 80 varieties and thousands of lines were developed to cater to regions in 20 african countries .
thomas yanga works for the united nation 's world food program , where he is responsible for west africa .
he is well aware of the attitudes of farmers in his home country of cameroon .
" i know from my own village that the people are very , very attached to the taste of certain commodities .
and for them the taste is more important than anything else .
any new variety that does not give them the same taste , they will reject , " he told deutsche welle .
monty jones from sierra leone was awarded the world food prize six years ago for his role in developing nerica .
while he is proud of the rich harvest reaped from the new rice variety , he is worried about the impact of climate change in the future .

trade unions are up in arms about the plan . french workers are facing the prospect of having to work for two more years before qualifying for a pension , as the minimum retirement age is set to rise to 62 .
details of the planned change , which was expected to meet strong resistance from trade unions , were announced by french labor minister eric woerth . " working longer is inevitable , " woerth told reporters following a meeting with president nicolas sarkozy on tuesday .
" there is not a magical solution . "
" all of our partners in europe have done it .
it is no longer possible to stay on the sidelines of this movement . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : woerth announced the plans after a meeting with president sarkozy on tuesday , tens of thousands of people demonstrated against the reforms in the runup to the announcement .
police said that 23,000 people took part in a march in paris , with union officials putting the figure at 70,000 .
future protests promised a bill on the changes is to be presented to the french cabinet in july before going before parliament in september .
unions have promised that they will fight the reforms with demonstrations and strikes .
the french government is introducing the changes , to be fully implemented by 2018 , in bid to trim spending on welfare and preserve its credit rating .
the right to a pension from the age of 60 has been part of the french system since 1982 .
under the present system , individuals can draw a full pension from the age of 60 provided that they have paid social security contributions for a minimum of 40 years and six months .
the reforms would also change the contribution period to 41 years .

that is the main finding of a new report presented by the german education ministry . more evidence of the desperate state of germany 's education system was revealed on wednesday , with the pre-publication of statistics from a new " education in germany " report .
according to the report , which is to be presented thursday by the german education ministry and the state conference on education , an assembly of germany 's state education ministers , 17 percent of young germans aged between 20 and 30 have no vocational qualification and are no longer in the education system .
this marks a new high - in 2007 , the figure was still at 15.2 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezdemir is convinced the problems are endemic the situation is particularly dire among young people with an immigrant background , 30 percent of whom have no formal training and no prospect of achieving further qualifications .
in the face of increasing pressures in the job market , the researchers warned that germany could be facing a long-term unemployment problem for those without formal qualifications .
one forecast predicts that the supply of unqualified workers would exceed the number of jobs in this sector by some 1.3 million for the next 15 years .
for cem oezdemir , education spokesman for the green party , the deficits in germany 's system are appalling .
" we 're talking about a sort of risk-group that leaves school lacking basic reading , writing and arithmetic skills - they are functionally illiterate , " he told deutsche welle .
no surprises problems have been endemic for years , and the report 's findings provide few surprises for those concerned with german education .
stephanie odenwald , director for vocational training at the educational workers ' union gew , said , " it 's not a surprise - everyone who knows the education system has known this problem for years . "
odenwald can also identify one of the main causes of the problem : " it is mainly the fault of the misguided development of this massive transitional system , where young people leave school and do n't get into job training programs and instead get put into these waiting loops , or ' job preparation schemes ' as they are known .
there is a very wide body of opinion that says we need to get rid of this system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children with an immigrant background are particularly disadvantaged this transitional system has often been blamed for leaving many of germany 's young people in limbo after leaving school , but oezdemir says that the problems are much deeper .
" what this study makes clear is that we need to question our whole education system - from kindergarten all the way to university , " he said .
" the interim system is just one element of it . "
the sacred cow gymnasium the new report is one of many that have indirectly brought attention to the injustices in germany 's three-tiered school system , which divides students according to ability into one of three different schools after the fourth grade - these are the hauptschule , the realschule and the elite gymnasium .
international comparisons like the pisa studies have highlighted the social inequalities that are caused by this system .
the report shows that hauptschule students continue to have problems finding job training places , even though the competition for them is said to be decreasing .
as far as oezdemir is concerned , germany 's conservative government resists reform because it is clinging to the gymnasium .
" there really is n't a recognition problem , " he says .
" these studies always come out with similar results .
there is an application problem .
we know the problems , but the politicians get bogged down in financial questions , and the taboo of the gymnasium .
the schools need to fit our children , not the other way round . "

many thousands of refugees are fleeing the ethnic clashes , with the united nations warning of a possible humanitarian catastrophe . ethnic groups in kyrgyzstan clashed again in overnight battles as the official death toll in the country rose to at least 179 , according to a report by the kyrgyz news agency akipress , quoting the health ministry . the ministry said that it expected the actual number of dead to be much higher . troops were patrolling streets in the city of osh on wednesday morning , following clashes between kyrgyz groups and the uzbek minority .
the number of civilians forced to flee the violence is now put at 275,000 according to the united nations high commission for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- . united nations children 's fund unicef reports that women , children and the elderly make up more than 90 percent of the refugees .
the situation was growing increasingly serious , the head of the unhcr said on wednesday . " what is happening is already a tragedy and it could become a catastrophe . "
antonio guterres said during a visit to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic uzbeks have been gathering near the kyrgyz-uzbek border " we urgently need to find a political solution ... the country 's neighbors and the international community must do everything in their power to help the interim kyrgyz government restore peace and stability , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
officials in kyrgyzstan have warned that the ethnic conflict could spread to the country 's north and neighboring countries as aid agencies attempt to cope with the humanitarian crisis in the central asian country .
some 2,000 people have been wounded in the fighting which erupted last thursday , according to official figures .
violence in the southern cities of osh and jalalabad has raised fears over the future stability of the country of 5.3 million , where uzbeks make up 14 percent of the population .
aid groups working overtime uzbekistan has been struggling to deal with a flood of ethnic refugees who crossed the border to escape the unrest .
with around 75,000 refugees already inside uzbekistan after fleeing the southern cities , authorities said they had closed off the border to prevent that number from swelling .
however the office of the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , which has been working to get relief supplies into the central asian countries , told deutsche welle it understood the border has now been reopened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations high commissioner for refugees , antonio guterres , warned of catastrophe " we have this understanding that the border is open .
we understand that yesterday it was closed temporarily for the night and now it is open , " says unhcr spokesperson babar baloch .
" the un high commissioner here in geneva , antonio guterres , has welcomed the uzbek authorities ' decision to open the border and welcome refugees who are seeking asylum in uzbekistan . "
baloch says that the unhcr plans to send six relief planes in total with 240 metric tons of supplies to uzbekistan in the coming days .
he said this would be followed by more aid once the unhcr had established a presence on the ground .
baloch added that the unhcr had been experiencing problems in reaching displaced peoples in areas around osh because of the security situation .
" we had hoped to be able to reach those people .
we have some stocks on the ground at the unhcr warehouse there in osh and we already have been in touch with the icrc -lrb- international committee of the red cross -rrb- to distribute the items we have there , but we understand and we are concerned at the poor security situation in osh and jalalabad and other areas which is impeding aid delivery . "
bildunterschrift : bodies litter the street as houses burn in jalabad military intervention meanwhile , roza otunbayeva , the interim president of kyrgyzstan , said on tuesday that there was no reason for russia to intervene by deploying peacekeepers to the crisis region .
she said the clashes were beginning to wane and that she hoped that her country 's own forces could get the situation under control .
moscow says it considers the violence in southern kyrgyzstan an internal matter for that country and has only sent several hundred troops to defend a russian military base in kyrgyzstan .
both russia and the united states have military installations in the central asian country , with the us using the strategic position as a hub to support its forces in afghanistan .
otunbayeva also said a planned constitutional referendum would go ahead on june 27 .
she was speaking at a press conference after the eu had warned that the violent clashes threatened to derail the country 's reform process .
however this view is not shared by icrc head of operations for central asia and eastern europe , pascale meige wagner , who warned " we 're far from seeing the end of this crisis . "
" we hear extremely worrying stories about people targeted - there is a will to harm and kill in kyrgzystan . "

but the band do have one thing in common with the world ’ s most famous book : a knowledge that big things are going to happen . abel & cain 's lead singer chris blöcher is sure that pretty soon there 'll come a time when stadium crowds are singing along to their songs .
" basically we ’ re ready for our time , our d-day in the music scene if you like , " he said , " that ’ s the only thing we want to do and we 're giving it our all to make sure it happens . "
quite ambitious , one might think , to compare their musical breakthrough with the normandy landings , but these aren ’ t empty words .
marek and chris have already enjoyed a taste of success with their previous band atemlos .
they scored three sizable chart hits , shot a bunch of music videos and were even featured on german music tv channel viva .
but despite their burgeoning popularity , they decided the direction the band was heading in just was n't them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : front man chris onstage a knack for pathos they let the atemlos project fold and switched to singing in english with the formation of abel & cain .
they 're not shy about citing big guns like oasis and coldplay as influences ; their music is rock with an emotional slant … and not necessarily always with positive origins .
" all these emotional songs and melodies actually originate from certain feelings of rage , " explains chris , " not necessarily against things which you have done wrong yourself but things that are or were frustrating and which play off each other .

their journey to fame and fortune has seen them successfully complete a stint at popcamp , an intense band coaching boot camp organized by the german music council , and put the finishing touches to the recordings for their debut album .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popcamp is a high-level band coaching project sponsored by the german music council all set for the international market chris is actually dreaming of a future where he isn ’ t chained to germany : " i 'd like to be somewhere where no one knows who i am , where i do n't know anyone , where i 'd never know what might happen when i walk around the corner .
that ’ s what i want . "
in order to accomplish that , he 's ditched the idea of singing in german with the view that english songs fare better internationally than german ones .

the five year plan abel & cain are n't dreaming of success ; as far as the four guys from düsseldorf are concerned , they 're already convinced it 's going to happen and that this is the right time .
at the moment , they 're all working flat out towards this goal so much so that chris knows exactly where he sees the band in five years ' time .
" i want to see the music we make mature and to see it develop into something round and perfect , " he adds , " i can picture way more live shows , touring our third album . i can really see us doing well in this business .
in fact , i can ’ t imagine anything else . "

the artist talked with deutsche welle about some of the big ideas behind them . contemporary installation artist christo turns 75 this week , less than a year after the loss of his wife and artistic partner jeanne-claude .
deutsche welle spoke with christo about how he is moving forward with his work and what he thinks about its reception .
two museums in germany - the kunsthalle wuerth and the max ernst museum in bruehl - are currently displaying some of his works .
deutsche welle : you had such a symbiotic relationship with jeanne-claude .
how is it for you to continue work now on the projects you had planned together ?
christo : we always knew that one of us would be the first to go , and we 've known that for almost the last 50 years .
ever since we met in 1958 , we 've always traveled in separate planes so that one of us would be able to finish the work we started .
so , everything was in some way already prepared .
these projects take so long to get permission and to realize that we always envisioned this was possible .
many people struggle to understand the concept that you do n't work for money .
what does it say about our society that people have so much trouble grasping that you do art simply to create new art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wrapped reichstag " -lrb- 1995 -rrb- was realized 24 years after its conception this relates to the way i was brought up and educated in bulgaria under communism .
basically , the projects deal in large part with freedom .
of course , i do make money by selling the preparatory drawings and studies for the projects .
on paper , i put down my visions , jeanne-claude 's visions , our visions .
i also produce a variety of tangible goods to create the funds necessary to build projects that can not be bought and can not be owned - even jeanne-claude and i do n't own them .
the projects are about freedom .
freedom is the enemy of possession , and possession is equal to permanence .
you know , humans like to be in the presence of things that are unique like they are - things that wo n't happen again .
the projects have a quality of fragility and tenderness , like our own lives or our own childhood .
they can not be substituted or repeated .
but how much of a problem do you think our society has in understanding what you 're trying to do with your work ?
i would never think about that myself .
we like to build these projects because we enjoy it for ourselves , like any true artist .
any artist - an abstract painter , a watercolorist , whoever - enjoys and lives to do the work .
the projects begin from an almost visceral desire to realize something because you think it 's beautiful .
if somebody likes the work , it 's almost like a bonus - an additional dimension .
these projects deal with a very wide variety of aesthetic dimensions .
a 3-d work of art is different from a painting with a flat surface .
with a sculpture , you can move around it , you perceive the volume and dimensions .
but all of that space is entirely designed by the artist , who exercises an absurd amount of control over the space .
now , there 's another space we think very little about .
the moment you walk out of your home , somebody else designed the sidewalk , the roads and the lights .
basically 24 hours a day , we 're in a highly planned space that we do n't even think about .
in our work , we more or less borrow that space and create a gentle disturbance for a few days .
by doing so , we inherit everything inherent to that space , and it becomes a part of the work of art .
you just turned 75 .
that 's significant in many ways , is n't it ?

do you perhaps want to do something permanent at this stage in your life ?
i do a lot of things that are permanent - a lot of drawings , sketches , collages , and sculptures .
they 're permanent and in museums .
i 'm not against the idea of things existing permanently .
for instance , each time a big project is finished and removed , it has its own documentation exhibition that tells the story of the project .
there are scale models , cables , fabric , and samples .
these exhibitions do not substitute for the projects .
they 're about the projects .
but through them , you should see connections to all the works - they 're connected , they 're not separate .

the artist talked with deutsche welle about some of the big ideas behind them . contemporary installation artist christo turns 75 this week , less than a year after the loss of his wife and artistic partner jeanne-claude .
deutsche welle spoke with christo about how he is moving forward with his work and what he thinks about its reception .
two museums in germany - the kunsthalle wuerth and the max ernst museum in bruehl - are currently displaying some of his works .
deutsche welle : you had such a symbiotic relationship with jeanne-claude .
how is it for you to continue work now on the projects you had planned together ?
christo : we always knew that one of us would be the first to go , and we 've known that for almost the last 50 years .
ever since we met in 1958 , we 've always traveled in separate planes so that one of us would be able to finish the work we started .
so , everything was in some way already prepared .
these projects take so long to get permission and to realize that we always envisioned this was possible .
many people struggle to understand the concept that you do n't work for money .
what does it say about our society that people have so much trouble grasping that you do art simply to create new art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wrapped reichstag " -lrb- 1995 -rrb- was realized 24 years after its conception this relates to the way i was brought up and educated in bulgaria under communism .
basically , the projects deal in large part with freedom .
of course , i do make money by selling the preparatory drawings and studies for the projects .
on paper , i put down my visions , jeanne-claude 's visions , our visions .
i also produce a variety of tangible goods to create the funds necessary to build projects that can not be bought and can not be owned - even jeanne-claude and i do n't own them .
the projects are about freedom .
freedom is the enemy of possession , and possession is equal to permanence .
you know , humans like to be in the presence of things that are unique like they are - things that wo n't happen again .
the projects have a quality of fragility and tenderness , like our own lives or our own childhood .
they can not be substituted or repeated .
but how much of a problem do you think our society has in understanding what you 're trying to do with your work ?
i would never think about that myself .
we like to build these projects because we enjoy it for ourselves , like any true artist .
any artist - an abstract painter , a watercolorist , whoever - enjoys and lives to do the work .
the projects begin from an almost visceral desire to realize something because you think it 's beautiful .
if somebody likes the work , it 's almost like a bonus - an additional dimension .
these projects deal with a very wide variety of aesthetic dimensions .
a 3-d work of art is different from a painting with a flat surface .
with a sculpture , you can move around it , you perceive the volume and dimensions .
but all of that space is entirely designed by the artist , who exercises an absurd amount of control over the space .
now , there 's another space we think very little about .
the moment you walk out of your home , somebody else designed the sidewalk , the roads and the lights .
basically 24 hours a day , we 're in a highly planned space that we do n't even think about .
in our work , we more or less borrow that space and create a gentle disturbance for a few days .
by doing so , we inherit everything inherent to that space , and it becomes a part of the work of art .
you just turned 75 .
that 's significant in many ways , is n't it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the gates " -lrb- 2005 -rrb- in new york city cost $ 21 million , raised entirely by the artists at least i 'm still alive -lrb- laughs -rrb- - but i really do n't think about that .
i 've lived in the same building for 46 years .
i climb 90 steps about 15 times a day - i do n't have an elevator .
do you perhaps want to do something permanent at this stage in your life ?
i do a lot of things that are permanent - a lot of drawings , sketches , collages , and sculptures .
they 're permanent and in museums .
i 'm not against the idea of things existing permanently .
for instance , each time a big project is finished and removed , it has its own documentation exhibition that tells the story of the project .
there are scale models , cables , fabric , and samples .
these exhibitions do not substitute for the projects .
they 're about the projects .
but through them , you should see connections to all the works - they 're connected , they 're not separate .
the reality of these large projects is that there are so many different levels of perception involved .
i think this is the body of our work together - it can not be separate .

the artist talked with deutsche welle about some of the big ideas behind them . contemporary installation artist christo turns 75 this week , less than a year after the loss of his wife and artistic partner jeanne-claude .
deutsche welle spoke with christo about how he is moving forward with his work and what he thinks about its reception .
two museums in germany - the kunsthalle wuerth and the max ernst museum in bruehl - are currently displaying some of his works .
deutsche welle : you had such a symbiotic relationship with jeanne-claude .
how is it for you to continue work now on the projects you had planned together ?
christo : we always knew that one of us would be the first to go , and we 've known that for almost the last 50 years .
ever since we met in 1958 , we 've always traveled in separate planes so that one of us would be able to finish the work we started .
so , everything was in some way already prepared .
these projects take so long to get permission and to realize that we always envisioned this was possible .
many people struggle to understand the concept that you do n't work for money .
what does it say about our society that people have so much trouble grasping that you do art simply to create new art ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " wrapped reichstag " -lrb- 1995 -rrb- was realized 24 years after its conception this relates to the way i was brought up and educated in bulgaria under communism .
basically , the projects deal in large part with freedom .
of course , i do make money by selling the preparatory drawings and studies for the projects .
on paper , i put down my visions , jeanne-claude 's visions , our visions .
i also produce a variety of tangible goods to create the funds necessary to build projects that can not be bought and can not be owned - even jeanne-claude and i do n't own them .
the projects are about freedom .
freedom is the enemy of possession , and possession is equal to permanence .
you know , humans like to be in the presence of things that are unique like they are - things that wo n't happen again .
the projects have a quality of fragility and tenderness , like our own lives or our own childhood .
they can not be substituted or repeated .
but how much of a problem do you think our society has in understanding what you 're trying to do with your work ?
i would never think about that myself .
we like to build these projects because we enjoy it for ourselves , like any true artist .
any artist - an abstract painter , a watercolorist , whoever - enjoys and lives to do the work .
the projects begin from an almost visceral desire to realize something because you think it 's beautiful .
if somebody likes the work , it 's almost like a bonus - an additional dimension .
these projects deal with a very wide variety of aesthetic dimensions .
a 3-d work of art is different from a painting with a flat surface .
with a sculpture , you can move around it , you perceive the volume and dimensions .
but all of that space is entirely designed by the artist , who exercises an absurd amount of control over the space .
now , there 's another space we think very little about .
the moment you walk out of your home , somebody else designed the sidewalk , the roads and the lights .
basically 24 hours a day , we 're in a highly planned space that we do n't even think about .
in our work , we more or less borrow that space and create a gentle disturbance for a few days .
by doing so , we inherit everything inherent to that space , and it becomes a part of the work of art .
you just turned 75 .
that 's significant in many ways , is n't it ?

cologne-based deg , part of the kfw banking group , lead the realization of the project .
bruno wenn , chairman of the board of management at deg will present this flagship project at the deutsche welle global media forum .
this year ’ s conference , entitled “ the heat is on – climate change and the media ” , will take place from june 21-23 in bonn .
within the framework of german development work , deg is responsible for financing investments of private companies for projects in developing and transition countries .
an example from the realm of climate change is the olkaria iii geothermal plant in kenya .
wenn says that the climate change debate has been shaped by the role of the public sector .
“ the participation of the private sector has mostly been missing in public discussions until now , ” he says .
for olkaria iii , 105 million dollars -lrb- us -rrb- were provided by outside financing .
deg ’ s requirements : the project must be “ operational , profitable , environmental and socially acceptable ” .
wenn is convinced that olkaria iii can be a glowing example for making climate projects profitable .
however , he also says that the private infrastructures that exist in developing countries are a major challenge .
when working on olkaria iii , deg benefited from kfw ’ s cooperation with the state-run power company in kenya , in order to get more investors on board .
wenn states that geothermal energy isn ’ t a futuristic vision .
“ the capacity in 2008 was just behind solar energy worldwide .
there is a lot of potential in the americas and in asia , ” says wenn .
“ the usa is currently the largest consumer of geothermal energy , followed by the philippines , indonesia and mexico . ”
it could also be important in africa .
“ olkaria iii is like the core in africa for further development in the region and a big step forward . ”
in bonn , wenn will make it clear that all stakeholders must reach a “ long-term , global agreement regarding the general conditions about climate change and the prevention of future greenhouse gas emissions . ”

it takes place at the world conference center bonn , close to deutsche welle ’ s headquarters .

massive amounts of oil are still gushing out and no one , neither bp nor the us government , can do anything about it .
are you astonished that the world 's superpower and one of the biggest oil company 's ca n't stop an oil leak ?
klaus toepfer : definitely .
i am to the utmost surprised .
it is not the only exploration in these depths , there are lots of others and if there is no possibility to stop such a leak then that gives us a totally new impression about the way we produce oil offshore ..
yes , it is more than astonishing that something is licensed when you can not handle a disaster like this .
president barack obama has been harshly criticised for his crisis management with charges that he has acted too late and not strongly enough .
how would you rate obama 's handling of the crisis ?
i think this was really an unexpected development .
that he is doing his utmost right now using not only strong words against bp , but also to integrate all the capacities of the superpower goes withhout saying .
so i would n't criticise him as harshly as he has been criticised by some commentators .
but this is a normal process in an open democratic system and you must be aware of those criticisms and you have to respond to it on a daily basis .
you have to have a clear understanding of the concerns of all the people living in the area most affected by the disaster .
you obviously have to focus on the ecological disaster , but this ecological disaster is linked with huge disaster for the people living in this region who earn their living with tourism , fishing and in other industries .
this serves as an important wake-up call that we now have to hurry up and change our options for producing electricity and energy so that we do n't need to depend any longer on these kinds of risky offshore endeavors .
bp has also been criticised very sharply over its handling and communication of the crisis .
what grade would you give them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toepfer i really believe they lost the control over how to handle the crisis and failed to live up to their responsibilty .
their performance was n't good at all and i am fairly sure that this will have consequences not only within bp , of course it has to start there , but for the industry as a whole .
we have to be aware that this is not only about bp , but there are comparable situations involving others as we saw with the exxon valdez and the disasters off the european coasts .
every crisis is of course an opportunity to learn and change something .
what consequences must be drawn from this crisis now ?
the first and most important consequence is : do your utmost to further develop new energy sources with lower risks .
because if we keep relying on fossil fuels , especially oil , we must recognize that the low-hanging fruits are already harvested and that we will maneuver ourselves into more and more risky and costly situations if we continue to rely on fossil fuels .
so it is high time that we further develop renewable energy and use sun and wind and biomass , geothermal and new energy sources like wave power .
we also have to realize now that the dream that oil is cheap is finally coming to an end .
of course it is easy to point one 's finger at the obama administration and bp for their handling of the crisis .
but are we sure that something like this could n't happen on our own front door in the north sea where there are also oil platforms and drilling ?
have germany and european countries done enough so that something like that ca n't happen there ?
the probability is definitely lower in the north sea .
there are different structures how to operate and handle those risks we saw in the gulf of mexico .
but nobody can be sure that there is zero risk in the north sea and other places in the world as well .
there is a risk , but the probability is much lower .
this oil disaster ranks already as the us ' worst environmental catastrophe in history .
as the un 's former point man on the environment : how bad is this on a global scale ?
this is a problem on a global scale without any doubt .
one should n't exaggerate it , but if you see all the images and pictures one can conclude that this is not just a limited problem in one region of the world , it is a clear signal for the whole world to come to a new assessment about those kinds of drillings and about oil production in general .
it would be a grave mistake to say do n't worry this is only a problem in the gulf of mexico .
klaus toepfer is the founding director of the institute for advanced sustainability studies in potsdam .

massive amounts of oil are still gushing out and no one , neither bp nor the us government , can do anything about it .
are you astonished that the world 's superpower and one of the biggest oil company 's ca n't stop an oil leak ?
klaus toepfer : definitely .
i am to the utmost surprised .
it is not the only exploration in these depths , there are lots of others and if there is no possibility to stop such a leak then that gives us a totally new impression about the way we produce oil offshore ..
yes , it is more than astonishing that something is licensed when you can not handle a disaster like this .
president barack obama has been harshly criticised for his crisis management with charges that he has acted too late and not strongly enough .
how would you rate obama 's handling of the crisis ?
i think this was really an unexpected development .
that he is doing his utmost right now using not only strong words against bp , but also to integrate all the capacities of the superpower goes withhout saying .
so i would n't criticise him as harshly as he has been criticised by some commentators .
but this is a normal process in an open democratic system and you must be aware of those criticisms and you have to respond to it on a daily basis .
you have to have a clear understanding of the concerns of all the people living in the area most affected by the disaster .
you obviously have to focus on the ecological disaster , but this ecological disaster is linked with huge disaster for the people living in this region who earn their living with tourism , fishing and in other industries .
this serves as an important wake-up call that we now have to hurry up and change our options for producing electricity and energy so that we do n't need to depend any longer on these kinds of risky offshore endeavors .
bp has also been criticised very sharply over its handling and communication of the crisis .
what grade would you give them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toepfer i really believe they lost the control over how to handle the crisis and failed to live up to their responsibilty .
their performance was n't good at all and i am fairly sure that this will have consequences not only within bp , of course it has to start there , but for the industry as a whole .
we have to be aware that this is not only about bp , but there are comparable situations involving others as we saw with the exxon valdez and the disasters off the european coasts .
every crisis is of course an opportunity to learn and change something .
what consequences must be drawn from this crisis now ?
the first and most important consequence is : do your utmost to further develop new energy sources with lower risks .
because if we keep relying on fossil fuels , especially oil , we must recognize that the low-hanging fruits are already harvested and that we will maneuver ourselves into more and more risky and costly situations if we continue to rely on fossil fuels .
so it is high time that we further develop renewable energy and use sun and wind and biomass , geothermal and new energy sources like wave power .
we also have to realize now that the dream that oil is cheap is finally coming to an end .
of course it is easy to point one 's finger at the obama administration and bp for their handling of the crisis .
but are we sure that something like this could n't happen on our own front door in the north sea where there are also oil platforms and drilling ?
have germany and european countries done enough so that something like that ca n't happen there ?
the probability is definitely lower in the north sea .
there are different structures how to operate and handle those risks we saw in the gulf of mexico .
but nobody can be sure that there is zero risk in the north sea and other places in the world as well .
there is a risk , but the probability is much lower .
this oil disaster ranks already as the us ' worst environmental catastrophe in history .
as the un 's former point man on the environment : how bad is this on a global scale ?
this is a problem on a global scale without any doubt .
one should n't exaggerate it , but if you see all the images and pictures one can conclude that this is not just a limited problem in one region of the world , it is a clear signal for the whole world to come to a new assessment about those kinds of drillings and about oil production in general .
it would be a grave mistake to say do n't worry this is only a problem in the gulf of mexico .
klaus toepfer is the founding director of the institute for advanced sustainability studies in potsdam .
from 1998 to 2006 he was executive director of the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- .
prior to that he served as germany 's minister for the env ironment , nature conservation and nuclear safety between 1987 and 1994 .

many thousands of refugees are fleeing the ethnic clashes , with the united nations warning of a possible humanitarian catastrophe . ethnic groups in kyrgyzstan clashed again in overnight battles as the official death toll in the country rose to at least 179 , according to a report by the kyrgyz news agency akipress , quoting the health ministry . the ministry said that it expected the actual number of dead to be much higher . troops were patrolling streets in the city of osh on wednesday morning , following clashes between kyrgyz groups and the uzbek minority .
the number of civilians forced to flee the violence is now put at 275,000 according to the united nations high commission for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- . united nations children 's fund unicef reports that women , children and the elderly make up more than 90 percent of the refugees .
the situation was growing increasingly serious , the head of the unhcr said on wednesday . " what is happening is already a tragedy and it could become a catastrophe . "
antonio guterres said during a visit to berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic uzbeks have been gathering near the kyrgyz-uzbek border " we urgently need to find a political solution ... the country 's neighbors and the international community must do everything in their power to help the interim kyrgyz government restore peace and stability , " he told public broadcaster deutschlandfunk .
officials in kyrgyzstan have warned that the ethnic conflict could spread to the country 's north and neighboring countries as aid agencies attempt to cope with the humanitarian crisis in the central asian country .
some 2,000 people have been wounded in the fighting which erupted last thursday , according to official figures .
violence in the southern cities of osh and jalalabad has raised fears over the future stability of the country of 5.3 million , where uzbeks make up 14 percent of the population .
aid groups working overtime uzbekistan has been struggling to deal with a flood of ethnic refugees who crossed the border to escape the unrest .
with around 75,000 refugees already inside uzbekistan after fleeing the southern cities , authorities said they had closed off the border to prevent that number from swelling .
however the office of the un high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- , which has been working to get relief supplies into the central asian countries , told deutsche welle it understood the border has now been reopened .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united nations high commissioner for refugees , antonio guterres , warned of catastrophe " we have this understanding that the border is open .
we understand that yesterday it was closed temporarily for the night and now it is open , " says unhcr spokesperson babar baloch .
" the un high commissioner here in geneva , antonio guterres , has welcomed the uzbek authorities ' decision to open the border and welcome refugees who are seeking asylum in uzbekistan . "
baloch says that the unhcr plans to send six relief planes in total with 240 metric tons of supplies to uzbekistan in the coming days .
he said this would be followed by more aid once the unhcr had established a presence on the ground .
baloch added that the unhcr had been experiencing problems in reaching displaced peoples in areas around osh because of the security situation .
" we had hoped to be able to reach those people .
we have some stocks on the ground at the unhcr warehouse there in osh and we already have been in touch with the icrc -lrb- international committee of the red cross -rrb- to distribute the items we have there , but we understand and we are concerned at the poor security situation in osh and jalalabad and other areas which is impeding aid delivery . "
bildunterschrift : bodies litter the street as houses burn in jalabad military intervention meanwhile , roza otunbayeva , the interim president of kyrgyzstan , said on tuesday that there was no reason for russia to intervene by deploying peacekeepers to the crisis region .
she said the clashes were beginning to wane and that she hoped that her country 's own forces could get the situation under control .
moscow says it considers the violence in southern kyrgyzstan an internal matter for that country and has only sent several hundred troops to defend a russian military base in kyrgyzstan .
both russia and the united states have military installations in the central asian country , with the us using the strategic position as a hub to support its forces in afghanistan .
otunbayeva also said a planned constitutional referendum would go ahead on june 27 .
she was speaking at a press conference after the eu had warned that the violent clashes threatened to derail the country 's reform process .
however this view is not shared by icrc head of operations for central asia and eastern europe , pascale meige wagner , who warned " we 're far from seeing the end of this crisis . "
" we hear extremely worrying stories about people targeted - there is a will to harm and kill in kyrgzystan . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 16.06.2010 general motors withdraws request for european aid for opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm now says it can rescue opel on its own general motors has withdrawn a request for a handful of european countries to give it financial aid to help restructure its european subsidiary opel .
gm also said that no further layoffs at opel were on the cards . us auto giant general motors has dropped its request for financial backing from european governments for its carmaker opel , saying it would restructure its european subsidiary itself .
further layoffs at opel have also been shelved .
opel said in a statement that it laid blame for the back flip on the lengthy process of obtaining government loan guarantees from germany , britain , spain , poland , austria and belgium - in which it employs some 48,000 workers altogether .
britain and spain had offered loan guarantees , but gm would now do without any government help .
" the validity and reasons for requesting government guarantees have ... not changed but the process has proven to be much more complex and longer than anticipated , " the firm said in a statement .
" gm 's recently improved financial strength has also been a catalyst for making this decision . "
the move comes as a surprise after gm for months insisted it needed european governments to pitch in to restructure opel .
no more layoffs opel said there would be no layoffs or plant closures beyond those already announced at the beginning of this year .
those measures called for opel to lose 8,300 workers in europe and close a plant in belgium .
gm had asked the european governments for 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees to restructure opel .
last week , germany , home to 23,000 opel employees , categorically ruled out providing its share of the guarantee - estimated at 1.1 billion euros - saying that gm had enough money of its own .
however , the four german states which have opel plants were looking at whether they could step in and at least partly fill the gap .
chief executive nick reilly has been pushing for a plan to invest 11 billion euros in the company until 2014 , updating 80 per cent of the opel model range .

massive amounts of oil are still gushing out and no one , neither bp nor the us government , can do anything about it .
are you astonished that the world 's superpower and one of the biggest oil company 's ca n't stop an oil leak ?
klaus toepfer : definitely .
i am to the utmost surprised .
it is not the only exploration in these depths , there are lots of others and if there is no possibility to stop such a leak then that gives us a totally new impression about the way we produce oil offshore ..
yes , it is more than astonishing that something is licensed when you can not handle a disaster like this .
president barack obama has been harshly criticised for his crisis management with charges that he has acted too late and not strongly enough .
how would you rate obama 's handling of the crisis ?
i think this was really an unexpected development .
that he is doing his utmost right now using not only strong words against bp , but also to integrate all the capacities of the superpower goes withhout saying .
so i would n't criticise him as harshly as he has been criticised by some commentators .
but this is a normal process in an open democratic system and you must be aware of those criticisms and you have to respond to it on a daily basis .
you have to have a clear understanding of the concerns of all the people living in the area most affected by the disaster .
you obviously have to focus on the ecological disaster , but this ecological disaster is linked with huge disaster for the people living in this region who earn their living with tourism , fishing and in other industries .
this serves as an important wake-up call that we now have to hurry up and change our options for producing electricity and energy so that we do n't need to depend any longer on these kinds of risky offshore endeavors .
bp has also been criticised very sharply over its handling and communication of the crisis .
what grade would you give them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toepfer i really believe they lost the control over how to handle the crisis and failed to live up to their responsibilty .
their performance was n't good at all and i am fairly sure that this will have consequences not only within bp , of course it has to start there , but for the industry as a whole .
we have to be aware that this is not only about bp , but there are comparable situations involving others as we saw with the exxon valdez and the disasters off the european coasts .
every crisis is of course an opportunity to learn and change something .
what consequences must be drawn from this crisis now ?
the first and most important consequence is : do your utmost to further develop new energy sources with lower risks .
because if we keep relying on fossil fuels , especially oil , we must recognize that the low-hanging fruits are already harvested and that we will maneuver ourselves into more and more risky and costly situations if we continue to rely on fossil fuels .
so it is high time that we further develop renewable energy and use sun and wind and biomass , geothermal and new energy sources like wave power .
we also have to realize now that the dream that oil is cheap is finally coming to an end .
of course it is easy to point one 's finger at the obama administration and bp for their handling of the crisis .
but are we sure that something like this could n't happen on our own front door in the north sea where there are also oil platforms and drilling ?
have germany and european countries done enough so that something like that ca n't happen there ?
the probability is definitely lower in the north sea .
there are different structures how to operate and handle those risks we saw in the gulf of mexico .
but nobody can be sure that there is zero risk in the north sea and other places in the world as well .
there is a risk , but the probability is much lower .
this oil disaster ranks already as the us ' worst environmental catastrophe in history .
as the un 's former point man on the environment : how bad is this on a global scale ?
this is a problem on a global scale without any doubt .
one should n't exaggerate it , but if you see all the images and pictures one can conclude that this is not just a limited problem in one region of the world , it is a clear signal for the whole world to come to a new assessment about those kinds of drillings and about oil production in general .
it would be a grave mistake to say do n't worry this is only a problem in the gulf of mexico .
klaus toepfer is the founding director of the institute for advanced sustainability studies in potsdam .
from 1998 to 2006 he was executive director of the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- .
prior to that he served as germany 's minister for the env ironment , nature conservation and nuclear safety between 1987 and 1994 .

gm also said that no further layoffs at opel were on the cards . us auto giant general motors has dropped its request for financial backing from european governments for its carmaker opel , saying it would restructure its european subsidiary itself .
further layoffs at opel have also been shelved .
opel said in a statement that it laid blame for the back flip on the lengthy process of obtaining government loan guarantees from germany , britain , spain , poland , austria and belgium - in which it employs some 48,000 workers altogether .
britain and spain had offered loan guarantees , but gm would now do without any government help .
" the validity and reasons for requesting government guarantees have ... not changed but the process has proven to be much more complex and longer than anticipated , " the firm said in a statement .
" gm 's recently improved financial strength has also been a catalyst for making this decision . "
the move comes as a surprise after gm for months insisted it needed european governments to pitch in to restructure opel .
no more layoffs opel said there would be no layoffs or plant closures beyond those already announced at the beginning of this year .
those measures called for opel to lose 8,300 workers in europe and close a plant in belgium .
gm had asked the european governments for 1.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.2 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees to restructure opel .
last week , germany , home to 23,000 opel employees , categorically ruled out providing its share of the guarantee - estimated at 1.1 billion euros - saying that gm had enough money of its own .
however , the four german states which have opel plants were looking at whether they could step in and at least partly fill the gap .
chief executive nick reilly has been pushing for a plan to invest 11 billion euros in the company until 2014 , updating 80 per cent of the opel model range .

dw-world.de german states plan to talk money for opel four german states with opel plants will meet on tuesday to discuss loan guarantees for the us-owned , financially-troubled german carmaker .

massive amounts of oil are still gushing out and no one , neither bp nor the us government , can do anything about it .
are you astonished that the world 's superpower and one of the biggest oil company 's ca n't stop an oil leak ?
klaus toepfer : definitely .
i am to the utmost surprised .
it is not the only exploration in these depths , there are lots of others and if there is no possibility to stop such a leak then that gives us a totally new impression about the way we produce oil offshore ..
yes , it is more than astonishing that something is licensed when you can not handle a disaster like this .
president barack obama has been harshly criticised for his crisis management with charges that he has acted too late and not strongly enough .
how would you rate obama 's handling of the crisis ?
i think this was really an unexpected development .
that he is doing his utmost right now using not only strong words against bp , but also to integrate all the capacities of the superpower goes withhout saying .
so i would n't criticise him as harshly as he has been criticised by some commentators .
but this is a normal process in an open democratic system and you must be aware of those criticisms and you have to respond to it on a daily basis .
you have to have a clear understanding of the concerns of all the people living in the area most affected by the disaster .
you obviously have to focus on the ecological disaster , but this ecological disaster is linked with huge disaster for the people living in this region who earn their living with tourism , fishing and in other industries .
this serves as an important wake-up call that we now have to hurry up and change our options for producing electricity and energy so that we do n't need to depend any longer on these kinds of risky offshore endeavors .
bp has also been criticised very sharply over its handling and communication of the crisis .
what grade would you give them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toepfer i really believe they lost the control over how to handle the crisis and failed to live up to their responsibilty .
their performance was n't good at all and i am fairly sure that this will have consequences not only within bp , of course it has to start there , but for the industry as a whole .
we have to be aware that this is not only about bp , but there are comparable situations involving others as we saw with the exxon valdez and the disasters off the european coasts .
every crisis is of course an opportunity to learn and change something .
what consequences must be drawn from this crisis now ?
the first and most important consequence is : do your utmost to further develop new energy sources with lower risks .
because if we keep relying on fossil fuels , especially oil , we must recognize that the low-hanging fruits are already harvested and that we will maneuver ourselves into more and more risky and costly situations if we continue to rely on fossil fuels .
so it is high time that we further develop renewable energy and use sun and wind and biomass , geothermal and new energy sources like wave power .
we also have to realize now that the dream that oil is cheap is finally coming to an end .
of course it is easy to point one 's finger at the obama administration and bp for their handling of the crisis .
but are we sure that something like this could n't happen on our own front door in the north sea where there are also oil platforms and drilling ?
have germany and european countries done enough so that something like that ca n't happen there ?
the probability is definitely lower in the north sea .
there are different structures how to operate and handle those risks we saw in the gulf of mexico .
but nobody can be sure that there is zero risk in the north sea and other places in the world as well .
there is a risk , but the probability is much lower .
this oil disaster ranks already as the us ' worst environmental catastrophe in history .
as the un 's former point man on the environment : how bad is this on a global scale ?
this is a problem on a global scale without any doubt .
one should n't exaggerate it , but if you see all the images and pictures one can conclude that this is not just a limited problem in one region of the world , it is a clear signal for the whole world to come to a new assessment about those kinds of drillings and about oil production in general .
it would be a grave mistake to say do n't worry this is only a problem in the gulf of mexico .
klaus toepfer is the founding director of the institute for advanced sustainability studies in potsdam .

but the band do have one thing in common with the world ’ s most famous book : a knowledge that big things are going to happen . abel & cain 's lead singer chris blöcher is sure that pretty soon there 'll come a time when stadium crowds are singing along to their songs .
" basically we ’ re ready for our time , our d-day in the music scene if you like , " he said , " that ’ s the only thing we want to do and we 're giving it our all to make sure it happens . "

their journey to fame and fortune has seen them successfully complete a stint at popcamp , an intense band coaching boot camp organized by the german music council , and put the finishing touches to the recordings for their debut album .

unions have promised that they will fight the reforms with demonstrations and strikes .
the french government is introducing the changes , to be fully implemented by 2018 , in bid to trim spending on welfare and preserve its credit rating .

the facing the cuts investigation found that millions of pounds are to be cut from council budgets this year and jobs and services are under threat .
as the county prepares for the axe to fall , we look at how councils are bracing themselves for some lean times ahead .
' spending cuts ' finds out ...
efficiencies the cuts come at a time when local councils have been working to improve their towns and local areas to make lancashire a better place to live .
some projects are already on hold but now it 's up to councils to decide the best way to make efficiencies whilst trying to keep up services .
blackpool council are trying to buy the tower and the winter gardens government cuts force 200 blackpool council job losses preston council wants to press ahead with the tithebarn project to transform the city centre .
blackburn with darwen council , having seen the mall shopping centre being extended , also has ambitious plans for the rest of the town .
in hyndburn , pendle , burnley and rossendale new homes have been built by regenerate pennine lancashire while millions of pounds had been earmarked to transform the county 's secondary schools .
all of these projects could be affected ... the buzz phrase from whitehall is " it 's under review " .
the building schools for the future project , started by labour to build new secondary schools , also comes under the " review " category , confirmed in a statement in the commons by the education secretary michael gove .
deprivation the new schools in burnley and pendle are up and running , but blackburn with darwen is still working on its new plans , and preston , hyndburn and blackpool have also been earmarked for new schools .
the organisation which is building new houses in the run down areas of the east of the county - regenerate pennine lancashire - is one of ten pathfinder schemes which will face a total cut of £ 50m .
the north west development agency , which has funded many projects around the county like the revamp of the midland hotel in morecambe , and such agencies are also facing major reductions in funding .
it 's not clear how much , though .
all the councils say they need the money to tackle the deprivation which still exists in many areas .
fair system ?
rows of boarded up houses , graffiti on the walls and empty streets , there 's no denying that the daneshouse area of burnley is in need of some tlc .
one resident told bbc radio lancashire 's political reporter liz de courcey she hopes " to get out one day " from the neighbourhood .
the daneshouse area in burnley is in need of some tlc the government has drawn up a list of the reductions in grants each council will face .
ten councils will face the maximum cut of 2 % with four of them here in lancashire ; preston , burnley , pendle and hyndburn .
is this a fair system ?
the chief executive of burnley steve rumbelow thinks not .
" i think the most disappointing thing is how the government has set about creating the total figure and the formula they have applied .
" this has had a disproportionate effect on some local district councils because it is those councils , considered to be deprived , that have suffered the most which does not seem to be an outcome any government would want to achieve . "
mr rumbelow says the impact will be felt .
" it will affect real services for real people .
in a place like burnley we get additional money to tackle problems such as unemployment , really challenging issues like creating more jobs and it is the money which has been hit . "
blackburn with darwen council and blackpool council , lancashire 's two unitary authorities , face grant cuts of between £ 3m to £ 4m .
lancashire county council , which provides most of the services for many of us , has already saved some £ 21m in drawing up its annual budget .
' challenge ' it recently announced the closure of four recycling centres saving £ 1m but now has to find another £ 15m to £ 20m .
it will mean reductions in services but we do n't yet know where .
deputy council leader albert akinson said : " we will certainly have to reduce spending in some areas to meet this challenge but we 're well placed to do this in a controlled way and balance the budget . "
the county 's number one road scheme , the long awaited heysham link road which would provide a direct route to the m6 motorway is now on hold .
the government is cancelling the planned public inquiry and has told the lancashire county council it could seek alternative funding - highly unlikely in the current climate .
a plan to improve bus services between blackburn with darwen and hyndburn - costing some £ 50m - called pennine reach is also on hold .
it would have meant brand new bus stations and buses .
when it will happen is anyone 's guess .
it 's been suggested details of where the axe will fall will become clearer after the emergency budget next week but at the moment the county is bracing itself for a longer and more sustained period of austerity than arguably it 's ever felt before .
