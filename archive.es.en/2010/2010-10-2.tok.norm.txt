meanwhile , the dutch christian democrats have ratified a deal to form a government with the support of wilders ' party . populist dutch politician geert wilders , known for his strident anti-islam and anti-immigration views , held a speech in a berlin hotel on saturday amid protests outside the venue .
" germany too needs a political movement that defends the national identity of the country . germany 's political identity , its economic success , is threatened by islam , " wilders told an audience of some 500 people at a hotel in berlin 's tiergarten district .
" islam is a dangerous political ideology for everyone , " wilders , who is facing prosecution in the netherlands for incitement to hatred , said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing activists in berlin protested against wilders ' visit the event sparked protests in front of the hotel .
police said some more than 100 demonstrators holding up banners reading " berlin against nazis - it 's our right to stop them " and " send geert wilders home " rallied in front of the hotel . wilders claims islam is a totalitarian religion and advocates banning the koran , the burqa and the construction of mosques .
wilders ' party gets boost on saturday , delegates at a congress of the dutch christian democratic appeal -lrb- cda -rrb- in the netherlands voted overwhelmingly in favour of entering a center-right governing coalition which would rely on the support of wilders ' freedom party -lrb- pvv -rrb- .
june 's general election delivered a surge of support for the freedom party , which won the third biggest share of the seats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal paves the way for a dutch minority government supported by wilders ' party earlier this week , the liberal vvd and wilders ' pvv approved the deal which makes concessions to wilders such as allowing the netherlands to ban the full islamic veil .
the liberals -lrb- vvd -rrb- and cda , which hold 52 seats in the 150-member parliament , would rely on wilders ' 24 freedom party -lrb- pvv -rrb- mps to get legislation passed .
saturday 's vote was preceded by heated debate and objections by some members of the cda opposed to cooperating with wilders ' party .
merkel distances herself from wilders ' visit german lawmaker rene stadtkewitz formed his freedom party amid a heated national debate over integration , particularly in relation to muslims . a controversial book by former german central bank board member thilo sarrazin claiming that muslims were undermining german society thrust the subject into the spotlight last month .
the german government has distanced itself from wilders and the invitation by stadtkewitz to invite him to berlin .
" it is not our style to utterly condemn any religion , " german chancellor angela merkel said through her spokesman steffen seibert in berlin .
merkel had previously told the committee on european affairs of the bundestag parliament that she regretted the formation of a minority dutch coalition government which depends on wilders ' party to win key votes .
the event comes as fears mounts among german mainstream political parties of the emergence of a new anti-immigration , anti-islam right wing movement . author : richard connor -lrb- ap / afp / reuters / dpa -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now on show is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel . the largest collection of works from the german expressionist group die bruecke -lrb- " the bridge " -rrb- is housed in a modest , one-story building on the outskirts of berlin . the bruecke collective was founded in dresden in 1905 by four university students , who abandoned their studies to devote themselves to art . the founders - ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz beyl , erich heckel , and karl schmidt-rotluff - were obsessed with the desire to create a new type of art that , in their words , was " immediate and pure . " " their goal was to revolutionize art , and they did revolutionize german art because they wanted to portray inner emotions and their subjective perceptions and that was something very new at the time , " art academic kathy stoike told deutsche welle . the way the artists depicted objects and people was very new , and not understood at the time , stoike pointed out . " you see a storm of colors , and you have to imagine that the people in 1905 did n't have any color photography , any movies , and the neon lights you have today , they did n't exist , " she said .
" it was all a bit darker , and black and white . " from the heart to the canvas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this painting , " roman stilllife , " by erich heckel was stolen from the bruecke musuem in 2002 bruecke artists strove to capture their inner perception on canvas - not what they saw , but what they felt . painted by schmitt-rottluff , a sailboat seascape becomes a kaleidoscope of swirling colors , which evoke the joy and magic of a summer day at sea .
a reclining nude by kirchner , painted with bold , impulsive strokes of bright red , the shadows of her curves in blue and green , is striking and sensual , comforting and warm . the artists rejected not only the established conventions and aesthetics of classical art , but also its techniques , devising their own painting methods as they went along . though in terms of creative expression their techniques were very effective , they were also impractical , bruecke museum director magdalena moeller explained . " the artists were self-taught , " she remarked .
" they studied architecture , not art , and did n't know how to prepare canvases or work with oil paint . " the artists simply applied the paint right from the tube to the canvas .
" this was a completely unorthodox way to work with oil paints , " she said .
" and this is also why their paintings are so fragile ; the paint is not stabile on the canvas , and why today these works must be transported with such care . " bruecke at its climax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " farn in the marsch " by emil nolde , one of the great 20th-century water color painters up until 1910 , the group had developed a distinct collective style , taking as their subjects the natural beauty of landscapes and the human form .
each artist had his own individual technique , yet their works as a whole from this period possess simplicity of depiction , vibrant use of color and exquisite compositional harmony .
this period is seen as the climax of the bruecke 's artistic achievements . the bruecke artists moved to berlin in 1911 , where big city life greatly influenced their work .
sharp angles , edgy , brittle brushwork and a subdued color palette became their defining stylistic elements .
they focused on street scenes and austere portraits . in 1913 , personal and professional differences caused the group to disband , but the artists continued to work separately , with each gaining individual recognition by the 1920s . " of course in the ' 30s with the national socialists , they were all defamed as ' degenerate ' artists , " stoike said .
" they were re-established after the second world war , but figurative art was no longer favored then since it had been exploited by the nazis for propaganda reasons . " the art of the bruecke , although expressionistic , proved too figurative for the times and fell out of fashion .
tastes for more abstract art were developing , with artists like wassily kandinsky grabbing attention on the world art stage . still , over time , the bruecke became synonymous with the german expressionist movement , and took its rightful place within the international avant-garde . renewed bruecke popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city life influenced their work , like kirchner 's " berlin street scene " these days , the bruecke is enjoying a new surge of international popularity , claims museum director moeller .
her museum has recently had an increase in requests for loans of up to 150 works from renowned art institutions around the world , such as moscow 's pushkin museum , london 's royal academy and new york 's museum of modern art , to name a few . even the french are acquiring a taste for early german expressionists , with the first bruecke exhibition ever to take place in france next year . moeller said it was the simplicity and straight-forwardness of bruecke art that made it so appealing today .
" it 's not abstract or complicated or burdened with problems the viewer has to interpret ; nor is bruecke art a conceptual art so that you need additional knowledge to understand , " she pointed out . viewers can just sit back , relax and take in the vibrant colors and clear , simple lines .
the unorthodox approach to art created back then was a stroke of fate , stoike explained . " it was a movement against the bourgeoisie society , " stoike said .
" the artists loved to work outside , close to nature and inspired by it .

now on show is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel . the largest collection of works from the german expressionist group die bruecke -lrb- " the bridge " -rrb- is housed in a modest , one-story building on the outskirts of berlin . the bruecke collective was founded in dresden in 1905 by four university students , who abandoned their studies to devote themselves to art . the founders - ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz beyl , erich heckel , and karl schmidt-rotluff - were obsessed with the desire to create a new type of art that , in their words , was " immediate and pure . " " their goal was to revolutionize art , and they did revolutionize german art because they wanted to portray inner emotions and their subjective perceptions and that was something very new at the time , " art academic kathy stoike told deutsche welle . the way the artists depicted objects and people was very new , and not understood at the time , stoike pointed out . " you see a storm of colors , and you have to imagine that the people in 1905 did n't have any color photography , any movies , and the neon lights you have today , they did n't exist , " she said .
" it was all a bit darker , and black and white . " from the heart to the canvas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this painting , " roman stilllife , " by erich heckel was stolen from the bruecke musuem in 2002 bruecke artists strove to capture their inner perception on canvas - not what they saw , but what they felt . painted by schmitt-rottluff , a sailboat seascape becomes a kaleidoscope of swirling colors , which evoke the joy and magic of a summer day at sea .
a reclining nude by kirchner , painted with bold , impulsive strokes of bright red , the shadows of her curves in blue and green , is striking and sensual , comforting and warm . the artists rejected not only the established conventions and aesthetics of classical art , but also its techniques , devising their own painting methods as they went along . though in terms of creative expression their techniques were very effective , they were also impractical , bruecke museum director magdalena moeller explained . " the artists were self-taught , " she remarked .
" they studied architecture , not art , and did n't know how to prepare canvases or work with oil paint . " the artists simply applied the paint right from the tube to the canvas .
" this was a completely unorthodox way to work with oil paints , " she said .
" and this is also why their paintings are so fragile ; the paint is not stabile on the canvas , and why today these works must be transported with such care . " bruecke at its climax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " farn in the marsch " by emil nolde , one of the great 20th-century water color painters up until 1910 , the group had developed a distinct collective style , taking as their subjects the natural beauty of landscapes and the human form .
each artist had his own individual technique , yet their works as a whole from this period possess simplicity of depiction , vibrant use of color and exquisite compositional harmony .
this period is seen as the climax of the bruecke 's artistic achievements . the bruecke artists moved to berlin in 1911 , where big city life greatly influenced their work .
sharp angles , edgy , brittle brushwork and a subdued color palette became their defining stylistic elements .
they focused on street scenes and austere portraits . in 1913 , personal and professional differences caused the group to disband , but the artists continued to work separately , with each gaining individual recognition by the 1920s . " of course in the ' 30s with the national socialists , they were all defamed as ' degenerate ' artists , " stoike said .
" they were re-established after the second world war , but figurative art was no longer favored then since it had been exploited by the nazis for propaganda reasons . " the art of the bruecke , although expressionistic , proved too figurative for the times and fell out of fashion .
tastes for more abstract art were developing , with artists like wassily kandinsky grabbing attention on the world art stage . still , over time , the bruecke became synonymous with the german expressionist movement , and took its rightful place within the international avant-garde . renewed bruecke popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city life influenced their work , like kirchner 's " berlin street scene " these days , the bruecke is enjoying a new surge of international popularity , claims museum director moeller .
her museum has recently had an increase in requests for loans of up to 150 works from renowned art institutions around the world , such as moscow 's pushkin museum , london 's royal academy and new york 's museum of modern art , to name a few . even the french are acquiring a taste for early german expressionists , with the first bruecke exhibition ever to take place in france next year . moeller said it was the simplicity and straight-forwardness of bruecke art that made it so appealing today .
" it 's not abstract or complicated or burdened with problems the viewer has to interpret ; nor is bruecke art a conceptual art so that you need additional knowledge to understand , " she pointed out . viewers can just sit back , relax and take in the vibrant colors and clear , simple lines .
the unorthodox approach to art created back then was a stroke of fate , stoike explained . " it was a movement against the bourgeoisie society , " stoike said .

politicians have been urging germans to celebrate the accomplishments achieved in the united country over the past two decades . on october 3 , 1990 germany was officially reunified after four decades of division into the soviet-controlled communist german democratic republic in the east and the federal republic of germany in the west .
the berlin wall had fallen just 11 months earlier when germans celebrated their reunited status in front of the bundestag , or parliament , in berlin .
october 3 has been a public holiday since , with the northern port city of bremen this year taking its turn as the lead city for the celebrations .
the city has been turned into a venue for concerts , street parties , parades and appearances by leading politicians .
" today , we remember the brave citizens who fought for freedom .
that 's why we 're celebrating today with a citizens ' festival , " bremen mayor and the current president of the upper house of the german parliament , jens boehrnsen said on saturday as he kicked off the festivities .
in the market square , a version of the berlin wall has been erected to display images and texts showing the story of the country 's division and reunification .

fireworks and bottles were thrown but a police spokesman said fears of large-scale riots did not materialize . ahead of the weekend celebrations leftists groups and anarchists had threatened to launch attacks and civil unrest . merkel emphasizes solidarity chancellor angela merkel and german president christian wulff are due to give speeches on sunday , with a church service also planned .
all 16 of germany 's states and cities were being represented at the festival venue .
in her weekly video address , merkel urged germans to value the freedom and democracy reunification brought to eastern germany and not just complain about the costs .
" for people from the former gdr -lrb- german democratic republic -rrb- almost everything has changed , " she said , noting the " wave of solidarity " from the former west germany .
" it 's thanks to these joint efforts that we 've been able to rebuild so quickly , " she added .
in an interview with daily bild am sonntag , merkel said she wished people in the west would appreciate more what people in the former east had achieved .
" it 's a shame that some people still do n't understand that the gdr regime was one thing , but the individual people and their achievements are another . "
speaking ahead of the anniversary , president wulff said : " 20 years of german unity is an occasion to celebrate , but also to pause for thought .
the changes that have occurred in our country in this time are immense , particularly in the east . " famous landmark is a focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl presided over the process of german reunification in berlin , the brandenburg gate is the focal point for an entertainment program , with stage shows and attractions lined up along the avenue leading to the landmark .

kohl , aged 80 and now confined to a wheelchair , spoke of the significance of the occasion to a meeting of christian democratic party colleagues .
" these dates are an occasion to take pleasure in what we have achieved , to remember with gratitude and pride where we have come from and also to look forward together , " he said .

meanwhile , the dutch christian democrats have ratified a deal to form a government with the support of wilders ' party . populist dutch politician geert wilders , known for his strident anti-islam and anti-immigration views , held a speech in a berlin hotel on saturday amid protests outside the venue .
" germany too needs a political movement that defends the national identity of the country . germany 's political identity , its economic success , is threatened by islam , " wilders told an audience of some 500 people at a hotel in berlin 's tiergarten district .
" islam is a dangerous political ideology for everyone , " wilders , who is facing prosecution in the netherlands for incitement to hatred , said .
visit triggers protests the 47-year-old was invited to berlin by a party founded in september by rene stadtkewitz , a former member of angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- who is also a critic of islam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing activists in berlin protested against wilders ' visit the event sparked protests in front of the hotel .
police said some more than 100 demonstrators holding up banners reading " berlin against nazis - it 's our right to stop them " and " send geert wilders home " rallied in front of the hotel . wilders claims islam is a totalitarian religion and advocates banning the koran , the burqa and the construction of mosques .
wilders ' party gets boost on saturday , delegates at a congress of the dutch christian democratic appeal -lrb- cda -rrb- in the netherlands voted overwhelmingly in favour of entering a center-right governing coalition which would rely on the support of wilders ' freedom party -lrb- pvv -rrb- .

german daily sueddeutsche zeitung had reported that siemens said the 15 companies had discovered the virus and informed siemens of the incidents .
the paper said five of those clients had their head office in germany .
the incidents were reported a month ago , but siemens said that the virus is not causing problems anymore , according to the paper .
germany 's biggest utitlities rwe and e.on were not affected by the virus .
the company said they succeeded in isolating the virus at a test facility for further study .

sophisticated virus the virus has so far infected computers in indonesia , india , the united states , australia , britain , malaysia and pakistan .
the biggest target , however , has been iran and some believe the virus was designed to attack iran 's nuclear facilities .
the malware spreads via infected usb thumb drive memory sticks , exploiting vulnerabilities in the microsoft windows operating system .
the super-virus attacks software programs that run on supervisory control and data acquisition , or scada , systems , a product developed by siemens and sold around the world , including to iran .
scada is used to manage water supplies , oil rigs , power plants and other industrial facilities .
once the worm infects a system , it quickly sets up communications with a remote server computer that can be used to steal proprietary information or take control of the scada system .

politicians have been urging germans to celebrate the accomplishments achieved in the united country over the past two decades . on october 3 , 1990 germany was officially reunified after four decades of division into the soviet-controlled communist german democratic republic in the east and the federal republic of germany in the west .
the berlin wall had fallen just 11 months earlier when germans celebrated their reunited status in front of the bundestag , or parliament , in berlin .
october 3 has been a public holiday since , with the northern port city of bremen this year taking its turn as the lead city for the celebrations .
the city has been turned into a venue for concerts , street parties , parades and appearances by leading politicians .
" today , we remember the brave citizens who fought for freedom .
that 's why we 're celebrating today with a citizens ' festival , " bremen mayor and the current president of the upper house of the german parliament , jens boehrnsen said on saturday as he kicked off the festivities .
in the market square , a version of the berlin wall has been erected to display images and texts showing the story of the country 's division and reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surrounded by students , bremen mayor boehrnsen kicked off celebrations among the high points of the celebrations set to take place over the weekend are a firework display on saturday evening along with a performance by 1980s german pop sensation nena .
protests mainly peaceful around 1,500 mainly left-wing demonstrators held protests in bremen on saturday , coinciding with celebrations for the 20th anniversary of german reunification . under the motto " october 3rd is not a day to celebrate " the demonstrators marched through bremen 's city-center .
fireworks and bottles were thrown but a police spokesman said fears of large-scale riots did not materialize . ahead of the weekend celebrations leftists groups and anarchists had threatened to launch attacks and civil unrest . merkel emphasizes solidarity chancellor angela merkel and german president christian wulff are due to give speeches on sunday , with a church service also planned .
all 16 of germany 's states and cities were being represented at the festival venue .
in her weekly video address , merkel urged germans to value the freedom and democracy reunification brought to eastern germany and not just complain about the costs .
" for people from the former gdr -lrb- german democratic republic -rrb- almost everything has changed , " she said , noting the " wave of solidarity " from the former west germany .
" it 's thanks to these joint efforts that we 've been able to rebuild so quickly , " she added .
in an interview with daily bild am sonntag , merkel said she wished people in the west would appreciate more what people in the former east had achieved .
" it 's a shame that some people still do n't understand that the gdr regime was one thing , but the individual people and their achievements are another . "
speaking ahead of the anniversary , president wulff said : " 20 years of german unity is an occasion to celebrate , but also to pause for thought .
the changes that have occurred in our country in this time are immense , particularly in the east . " famous landmark is a focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl presided over the process of german reunification in berlin , the brandenburg gate is the focal point for an entertainment program , with stage shows and attractions lined up along the avenue leading to the landmark .
as the country prepared for the occasion , there was a rare speech on friday from former chancellor helmut kohl , who is known in germany as " the reunification chancellor . "
kohl , aged 80 and now confined to a wheelchair , spoke of the significance of the occasion to a meeting of christian democratic party colleagues .
" these dates are an occasion to take pleasure in what we have achieved , to remember with gratitude and pride where we have come from and also to look forward together , " he said .

meanwhile , the dutch christian democrats have ratified a deal to form a government with the support of wilders ' party . populist dutch politician geert wilders , known for his strident anti-islam and anti-immigration views , held a speech in a berlin hotel on saturday amid protests outside the venue .
" germany too needs a political movement that defends the national identity of the country . germany 's political identity , its economic success , is threatened by islam , " wilders told an audience of some 500 people at a hotel in berlin 's tiergarten district .
" islam is a dangerous political ideology for everyone , " wilders , who is facing prosecution in the netherlands for incitement to hatred , said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing activists in berlin protested against wilders ' visit the event sparked protests in front of the hotel .
police said some more than 100 demonstrators holding up banners reading " berlin against nazis - it 's our right to stop them " and " send geert wilders home " rallied in front of the hotel . wilders claims islam is a totalitarian religion and advocates banning the koran , the burqa and the construction of mosques .
wilders ' party gets boost on saturday , delegates at a congress of the dutch christian democratic appeal -lrb- cda -rrb- in the netherlands voted overwhelmingly in favour of entering a center-right governing coalition which would rely on the support of wilders ' freedom party -lrb- pvv -rrb- .
june 's general election delivered a surge of support for the freedom party , which won the third biggest share of the seats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal paves the way for a dutch minority government supported by wilders ' party earlier this week , the liberal vvd and wilders ' pvv approved the deal which makes concessions to wilders such as allowing the netherlands to ban the full islamic veil .
the liberals -lrb- vvd -rrb- and cda , which hold 52 seats in the 150-member parliament , would rely on wilders ' 24 freedom party -lrb- pvv -rrb- mps to get legislation passed .
saturday 's vote was preceded by heated debate and objections by some members of the cda opposed to cooperating with wilders ' party .
merkel distances herself from wilders ' visit german lawmaker rene stadtkewitz formed his freedom party amid a heated national debate over integration , particularly in relation to muslims . a controversial book by former german central bank board member thilo sarrazin claiming that muslims were undermining german society thrust the subject into the spotlight last month .
the german government has distanced itself from wilders and the invitation by stadtkewitz to invite him to berlin .
" it is not our style to utterly condemn any religion , " german chancellor angela merkel said through her spokesman steffen seibert in berlin .
merkel had previously told the committee on european affairs of the bundestag parliament that she regretted the formation of a minority dutch coalition government which depends on wilders ' party to win key votes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 02.10.2010 the ' bruecke ' artists revolutionized german art with vibrant colors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " two girls by the water " by erich heckel the bruecke museum is a treasure trove of german expressionist art , with the movement 's artists having helped redefine the craft in the early 20th century .
now on show is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel . the largest collection of works from the german expressionist group die bruecke -lrb- " the bridge " -rrb- is housed in a modest , one-story building on the outskirts of berlin . the bruecke collective was founded in dresden in 1905 by four university students , who abandoned their studies to devote themselves to art . the founders - ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz beyl , erich heckel , and karl schmidt-rotluff - were obsessed with the desire to create a new type of art that , in their words , was " immediate and pure . " " their goal was to revolutionize art , and they did revolutionize german art because they wanted to portray inner emotions and their subjective perceptions and that was something very new at the time , " art academic kathy stoike told deutsche welle . the way the artists depicted objects and people was very new , and not understood at the time , stoike pointed out . " you see a storm of colors , and you have to imagine that the people in 1905 did n't have any color photography , any movies , and the neon lights you have today , they did n't exist , " she said .
" it was all a bit darker , and black and white . " from the heart to the canvas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this painting , " roman stilllife , " by erich heckel was stolen from the bruecke musuem in 2002 bruecke artists strove to capture their inner perception on canvas - not what they saw , but what they felt . painted by schmitt-rottluff , a sailboat seascape becomes a kaleidoscope of swirling colors , which evoke the joy and magic of a summer day at sea .
a reclining nude by kirchner , painted with bold , impulsive strokes of bright red , the shadows of her curves in blue and green , is striking and sensual , comforting and warm . the artists rejected not only the established conventions and aesthetics of classical art , but also its techniques , devising their own painting methods as they went along . though in terms of creative expression their techniques were very effective , they were also impractical , bruecke museum director magdalena moeller explained . " the artists were self-taught , " she remarked .
" they studied architecture , not art , and did n't know how to prepare canvases or work with oil paint . " the artists simply applied the paint right from the tube to the canvas .
" this was a completely unorthodox way to work with oil paints , " she said .
" and this is also why their paintings are so fragile ; the paint is not stabile on the canvas , and why today these works must be transported with such care . " bruecke at its climax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " farn in the marsch " by emil nolde , one of the great 20th-century water color painters up until 1910 , the group had developed a distinct collective style , taking as their subjects the natural beauty of landscapes and the human form .
each artist had his own individual technique , yet their works as a whole from this period possess simplicity of depiction , vibrant use of color and exquisite compositional harmony .
this period is seen as the climax of the bruecke 's artistic achievements . the bruecke artists moved to berlin in 1911 , where big city life greatly influenced their work .
sharp angles , edgy , brittle brushwork and a subdued color palette became their defining stylistic elements .
they focused on street scenes and austere portraits . in 1913 , personal and professional differences caused the group to disband , but the artists continued to work separately , with each gaining individual recognition by the 1920s . " of course in the ' 30s with the national socialists , they were all defamed as ' degenerate ' artists , " stoike said .
" they were re-established after the second world war , but figurative art was no longer favored then since it had been exploited by the nazis for propaganda reasons . " the art of the bruecke , although expressionistic , proved too figurative for the times and fell out of fashion .
tastes for more abstract art were developing , with artists like wassily kandinsky grabbing attention on the world art stage . still , over time , the bruecke became synonymous with the german expressionist movement , and took its rightful place within the international avant-garde . renewed bruecke popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city life influenced their work , like kirchner 's " berlin street scene " these days , the bruecke is enjoying a new surge of international popularity , claims museum director moeller .
her museum has recently had an increase in requests for loans of up to 150 works from renowned art institutions around the world , such as moscow 's pushkin museum , london 's royal academy and new york 's museum of modern art , to name a few . even the french are acquiring a taste for early german expressionists , with the first bruecke exhibition ever to take place in france next year . moeller said it was the simplicity and straight-forwardness of bruecke art that made it so appealing today .

now on show is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel . the largest collection of works from the german expressionist group die bruecke -lrb- " the bridge " -rrb- is housed in a modest , one-story building on the outskirts of berlin . the bruecke collective was founded in dresden in 1905 by four university students , who abandoned their studies to devote themselves to art . the founders - ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz beyl , erich heckel , and karl schmidt-rotluff - were obsessed with the desire to create a new type of art that , in their words , was " immediate and pure . " " their goal was to revolutionize art , and they did revolutionize german art because they wanted to portray inner emotions and their subjective perceptions and that was something very new at the time , " art academic kathy stoike told deutsche welle . the way the artists depicted objects and people was very new , and not understood at the time , stoike pointed out . " you see a storm of colors , and you have to imagine that the people in 1905 did n't have any color photography , any movies , and the neon lights you have today , they did n't exist , " she said .
" it was all a bit darker , and black and white . " from the heart to the canvas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this painting , " roman stilllife , " by erich heckel was stolen from the bruecke musuem in 2002 bruecke artists strove to capture their inner perception on canvas - not what they saw , but what they felt . painted by schmitt-rottluff , a sailboat seascape becomes a kaleidoscope of swirling colors , which evoke the joy and magic of a summer day at sea .
a reclining nude by kirchner , painted with bold , impulsive strokes of bright red , the shadows of her curves in blue and green , is striking and sensual , comforting and warm . the artists rejected not only the established conventions and aesthetics of classical art , but also its techniques , devising their own painting methods as they went along . though in terms of creative expression their techniques were very effective , they were also impractical , bruecke museum director magdalena moeller explained . " the artists were self-taught , " she remarked .
" they studied architecture , not art , and did n't know how to prepare canvases or work with oil paint . " the artists simply applied the paint right from the tube to the canvas .
" this was a completely unorthodox way to work with oil paints , " she said .
" and this is also why their paintings are so fragile ; the paint is not stabile on the canvas , and why today these works must be transported with such care . " bruecke at its climax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " farn in the marsch " by emil nolde , one of the great 20th-century water color painters up until 1910 , the group had developed a distinct collective style , taking as their subjects the natural beauty of landscapes and the human form .
each artist had his own individual technique , yet their works as a whole from this period possess simplicity of depiction , vibrant use of color and exquisite compositional harmony .
this period is seen as the climax of the bruecke 's artistic achievements . the bruecke artists moved to berlin in 1911 , where big city life greatly influenced their work .
sharp angles , edgy , brittle brushwork and a subdued color palette became their defining stylistic elements .
they focused on street scenes and austere portraits . in 1913 , personal and professional differences caused the group to disband , but the artists continued to work separately , with each gaining individual recognition by the 1920s . " of course in the ' 30s with the national socialists , they were all defamed as ' degenerate ' artists , " stoike said .
" they were re-established after the second world war , but figurative art was no longer favored then since it had been exploited by the nazis for propaganda reasons . " the art of the bruecke , although expressionistic , proved too figurative for the times and fell out of fashion .
tastes for more abstract art were developing , with artists like wassily kandinsky grabbing attention on the world art stage . still , over time , the bruecke became synonymous with the german expressionist movement , and took its rightful place within the international avant-garde . renewed bruecke popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city life influenced their work , like kirchner 's " berlin street scene " these days , the bruecke is enjoying a new surge of international popularity , claims museum director moeller .
her museum has recently had an increase in requests for loans of up to 150 works from renowned art institutions around the world , such as moscow 's pushkin museum , london 's royal academy and new york 's museum of modern art , to name a few . even the french are acquiring a taste for early german expressionists , with the first bruecke exhibition ever to take place in france next year . moeller said it was the simplicity and straight-forwardness of bruecke art that made it so appealing today .
" it 's not abstract or complicated or burdened with problems the viewer has to interpret ; nor is bruecke art a conceptual art so that you need additional knowledge to understand , " she pointed out . viewers can just sit back , relax and take in the vibrant colors and clear , simple lines .
the unorthodox approach to art created back then was a stroke of fate , stoike explained . " it was a movement against the bourgeoisie society , " stoike said .
" the artists loved to work outside , close to nature and inspired by it .
i like to think of them as the first hippies , long before those of the 1960s . " author : leah mcdonnell -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen the latest exhibition at the bruecke museum is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel , combining works from its own collection as well as those on loan from the united states , england and europe .

meanwhile , the dutch christian democrats have ratified a deal to form a government with the support of wilders ' party . populist dutch politician geert wilders , known for his strident anti-islam and anti-immigration views , held a speech in a berlin hotel on saturday amid protests outside the venue .
" germany too needs a political movement that defends the national identity of the country . germany 's political identity , its economic success , is threatened by islam , " wilders told an audience of some 500 people at a hotel in berlin 's tiergarten district .
" islam is a dangerous political ideology for everyone , " wilders , who is facing prosecution in the netherlands for incitement to hatred , said .
visit triggers protests the 47-year-old was invited to berlin by a party founded in september by rene stadtkewitz , a former member of angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- who is also a critic of islam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing activists in berlin protested against wilders ' visit the event sparked protests in front of the hotel .
police said some more than 100 demonstrators holding up banners reading " berlin against nazis - it 's our right to stop them " and " send geert wilders home " rallied in front of the hotel . wilders claims islam is a totalitarian religion and advocates banning the koran , the burqa and the construction of mosques .
wilders ' party gets boost on saturday , delegates at a congress of the dutch christian democratic appeal -lrb- cda -rrb- in the netherlands voted overwhelmingly in favour of entering a center-right governing coalition which would rely on the support of wilders ' freedom party -lrb- pvv -rrb- .
june 's general election delivered a surge of support for the freedom party , which won the third biggest share of the seats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal paves the way for a dutch minority government supported by wilders ' party earlier this week , the liberal vvd and wilders ' pvv approved the deal which makes concessions to wilders such as allowing the netherlands to ban the full islamic veil .
the liberals -lrb- vvd -rrb- and cda , which hold 52 seats in the 150-member parliament , would rely on wilders ' 24 freedom party -lrb- pvv -rrb- mps to get legislation passed .
saturday 's vote was preceded by heated debate and objections by some members of the cda opposed to cooperating with wilders ' party .
merkel distances herself from wilders ' visit german lawmaker rene stadtkewitz formed his freedom party amid a heated national debate over integration , particularly in relation to muslims . a controversial book by former german central bank board member thilo sarrazin claiming that muslims were undermining german society thrust the subject into the spotlight last month .
the german government has distanced itself from wilders and the invitation by stadtkewitz to invite him to berlin .
" it is not our style to utterly condemn any religion , " german chancellor angela merkel said through her spokesman steffen seibert in berlin .
merkel had previously told the committee on european affairs of the bundestag parliament that she regretted the formation of a minority dutch coalition government which depends on wilders ' party to win key votes .

german daily sueddeutsche zeitung had reported that siemens said the 15 companies had discovered the virus and informed siemens of the incidents .
the paper said five of those clients had their head office in germany .
the incidents were reported a month ago , but siemens said that the virus is not causing problems anymore , according to the paper .
germany 's biggest utitlities rwe and e.on were not affected by the virus .
the company said they succeeded in isolating the virus at a test facility for further study .
" our analyses have not yielded any conclusions on the specific purpose or the maker of the virus , " siemens told the paper .
sophisticated virus the virus has so far infected computers in indonesia , india , the united states , australia , britain , malaysia and pakistan .
the biggest target , however , has been iran and some believe the virus was designed to attack iran 's nuclear facilities .
the malware spreads via infected usb thumb drive memory sticks , exploiting vulnerabilities in the microsoft windows operating system .
the super-virus attacks software programs that run on supervisory control and data acquisition , or scada , systems , a product developed by siemens and sold around the world , including to iran .
scada is used to manage water supplies , oil rigs , power plants and other industrial facilities .
once the worm infects a system , it quickly sets up communications with a remote server computer that can be used to steal proprietary information or take control of the scada system .

politicians have been urging germans to celebrate the accomplishments achieved in the united country over the past two decades . on october 3 , 1990 germany was officially reunified after four decades of division into the soviet-controlled communist german democratic republic in the east and the federal republic of germany in the west .
the berlin wall had fallen just 11 months earlier when germans celebrated their reunited status in front of the bundestag , or parliament , in berlin .
october 3 has been a public holiday since , with the northern port city of bremen this year taking its turn as the lead city for the celebrations .
the city has been turned into a venue for concerts , street parties , parades and appearances by leading politicians .
" today , we remember the brave citizens who fought for freedom .
that 's why we 're celebrating today with a citizens ' festival , " bremen mayor and the current president of the upper house of the german parliament , jens boehrnsen said on saturday as he kicked off the festivities .
in the market square , a version of the berlin wall has been erected to display images and texts showing the story of the country 's division and reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surrounded by students , bremen mayor boehrnsen kicked off celebrations among the high points of the celebrations set to take place over the weekend are a firework display on saturday evening along with a performance by 1980s german pop sensation nena .
protests mainly peaceful around 1,500 mainly left-wing demonstrators held protests in bremen on saturday , coinciding with celebrations for the 20th anniversary of german reunification . under the motto " october 3rd is not a day to celebrate " the demonstrators marched through bremen 's city-center .
fireworks and bottles were thrown but a police spokesman said fears of large-scale riots did not materialize . ahead of the weekend celebrations leftists groups and anarchists had threatened to launch attacks and civil unrest . merkel emphasizes solidarity chancellor angela merkel and german president christian wulff are due to give speeches on sunday , with a church service also planned .
all 16 of germany 's states and cities were being represented at the festival venue .
in her weekly video address , merkel urged germans to value the freedom and democracy reunification brought to eastern germany and not just complain about the costs .
" for people from the former gdr -lrb- german democratic republic -rrb- almost everything has changed , " she said , noting the " wave of solidarity " from the former west germany .
" it 's thanks to these joint efforts that we 've been able to rebuild so quickly , " she added .
in an interview with daily bild am sonntag , merkel said she wished people in the west would appreciate more what people in the former east had achieved .
" it 's a shame that some people still do n't understand that the gdr regime was one thing , but the individual people and their achievements are another . "
speaking ahead of the anniversary , president wulff said : " 20 years of german unity is an occasion to celebrate , but also to pause for thought .
the changes that have occurred in our country in this time are immense , particularly in the east . " famous landmark is a focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl presided over the process of german reunification in berlin , the brandenburg gate is the focal point for an entertainment program , with stage shows and attractions lined up along the avenue leading to the landmark .
as the country prepared for the occasion , there was a rare speech on friday from former chancellor helmut kohl , who is known in germany as " the reunification chancellor . "
kohl , aged 80 and now confined to a wheelchair , spoke of the significance of the occasion to a meeting of christian democratic party colleagues .
" these dates are an occasion to take pleasure in what we have achieved , to remember with gratitude and pride where we have come from and also to look forward together , " he said .

but important differences in gay life still remain . as germany celebrates the 20th anniversary of reunification , the former east-west divide in the country 's gay and lesbian rights movement has all but disappeared .
there is currently close cooperation between gay and lesbian activists in the eastern and western states , according to eduard stapel , founder of several gay rights groups in former east germany .
unlike the united states , where gay rights vary widely from state to state , the legal rights of gays and lesbians are virtually the same in the east and west .
" that 's apart from the fact that we 've made slightly more progress in eastern germany , with discrimination bans in the berlin , brandenburg and thuringia state constitutions , " stapel told deutsche welle .
" but that has little effect on everyday life . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays in berlin enjoy one of the most accepting environments social acceptance of homosexuality is also roughly the same in eastern and western states , according to a 2001 study by the opinion research group tns emnid .
the study found that nearly the same percentage of people in the east as in the west say homosexuality is no longer objectionable .
the highest percentage of acceptance was in berlin , while the lowest was in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
gay life in former east germany while there is very little documentation of gay life in former east germany , a unique exception is the 1989 film " coming out . "
it follows a young teacher in east berlin struggling to accept his gay identity , and was the first and only gay-themed film produced in east germany .
it also won the second-place silver bear prize in the 1990 berlin film festival .
the film 's premiere was coincidentally held on november 9 , 1989 , the same night east german authorities opened the border to the west and people from across germany began to tear down the berlin wall .
matthias freihof , who played the protagonist phillip , said when he was first offered the leading role in the film , he knew it would be a major boost to his career .
the director , heiner carow , was one of the most well-known and respected directors in all of east germany .
what freihof did not anticipate was the long-lasting effect " coming out " would have on gay cinema .
bildunterschrift : " coming out " won the silver bear award at the 1990 berlin film festival " i 'm on the way to different festivals almost every year , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is very astonishing for me , that this film still has the power to entertain people , to pull them into the story . "
" coming out " was made at a time of huge political upheaval in all of eastern europe , just as the east german gay and lesbian community was becoming more visible .
the first gay-themed theater production , a growing number of books and resources on homosexuality all marked the beginnings of an organized gay rights movement .
" there was a kind of liberation coming up in the early 80s , so the step to do a film about this subject was clear , " freihof said .
" but the officials did n't like the idea , of course , because they knew about the subject , but they did n't want to make a big thing out of it . "
reunification depoliticizes the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stapel founded many east german gay organizations under a repressive government , political activism actually flourished in east germany , stapel said .
gays rights activists , alongside feminists , human rights activists and environmentalists , formed a strong and unified civil rights movement that opposed the east german authoritarian state .
political activism there filled the void left by the absence of a real social scene , like bars , restaurants and movie theaters , stapel said .
but after the fall of the berlin wall and the emergence of capitalism in east germany , the gay community became less political and less organized .
" people in communist east germany would go wherever things were happening , and that was the case with political groups , " stapel said .
" but when all of a sudden there is a social scene , then there 's no more reason to go to political groups . "
film shows far-right extremism an important exception to the depoliticization in eastern germany is the rise of right-wing extremism .
neo-nazi groups have grown in the east since reunification , which freihof said was easily foreseen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazism has been a growing problem in the east " our film was the first film that showed the neo-nazis in east berlin , because that was something nobody was talking about from official side , " he said .
" so after the wall came down , this problem became bigger and bigger , and for us it was not surprising . "
in one scene of " coming out , " freihof 's character phillip witnesses a group of neo-nazis attacking a young man they believe is gay in a subway station .
such attacks were not uncommon , freihof said , as far-right groups became more active and increasingly targeted the gay community .
" it happened sometimes that neo-nazi groups went to gay places to fight with the people , " freihof said .
but the rise of right-wing extremism in the east since reunification and its influence on violence against gays should not be overstated , according to stapel .
one of the more pressing concerns there is discrimination in the workplace .
" many people in the east are much more afraid now than during communism of losing their jobs because of their sexuality , " he said .

but important differences in gay life still remain . as germany celebrates the 20th anniversary of reunification , the former east-west divide in the country 's gay and lesbian rights movement has all but disappeared .
there is currently close cooperation between gay and lesbian activists in the eastern and western states , according to eduard stapel , founder of several gay rights groups in former east germany .
unlike the united states , where gay rights vary widely from state to state , the legal rights of gays and lesbians are virtually the same in the east and west .
" that 's apart from the fact that we 've made slightly more progress in eastern germany , with discrimination bans in the berlin , brandenburg and thuringia state constitutions , " stapel told deutsche welle .
" but that has little effect on everyday life . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays in berlin enjoy one of the most accepting environments social acceptance of homosexuality is also roughly the same in eastern and western states , according to a 2001 study by the opinion research group tns emnid .
the study found that nearly the same percentage of people in the east as in the west say homosexuality is no longer objectionable .
the highest percentage of acceptance was in berlin , while the lowest was in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
gay life in former east germany while there is very little documentation of gay life in former east germany , a unique exception is the 1989 film " coming out . "
it follows a young teacher in east berlin struggling to accept his gay identity , and was the first and only gay-themed film produced in east germany .
it also won the second-place silver bear prize in the 1990 berlin film festival .
the film 's premiere was coincidentally held on november 9 , 1989 , the same night east german authorities opened the border to the west and people from across germany began to tear down the berlin wall .
matthias freihof , who played the protagonist phillip , said when he was first offered the leading role in the film , he knew it would be a major boost to his career .
the director , heiner carow , was one of the most well-known and respected directors in all of east germany .
what freihof did not anticipate was the long-lasting effect " coming out " would have on gay cinema .
bildunterschrift : " coming out " won the silver bear award at the 1990 berlin film festival " i 'm on the way to different festivals almost every year , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is very astonishing for me , that this film still has the power to entertain people , to pull them into the story . "
" coming out " was made at a time of huge political upheaval in all of eastern europe , just as the east german gay and lesbian community was becoming more visible .
the first gay-themed theater production , a growing number of books and resources on homosexuality all marked the beginnings of an organized gay rights movement .
" there was a kind of liberation coming up in the early 80s , so the step to do a film about this subject was clear , " freihof said .
" but the officials did n't like the idea , of course , because they knew about the subject , but they did n't want to make a big thing out of it . "
reunification depoliticizes the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stapel founded many east german gay organizations under a repressive government , political activism actually flourished in east germany , stapel said .
gays rights activists , alongside feminists , human rights activists and environmentalists , formed a strong and unified civil rights movement that opposed the east german authoritarian state .
political activism there filled the void left by the absence of a real social scene , like bars , restaurants and movie theaters , stapel said .
but after the fall of the berlin wall and the emergence of capitalism in east germany , the gay community became less political and less organized .
" people in communist east germany would go wherever things were happening , and that was the case with political groups , " stapel said .
" but when all of a sudden there is a social scene , then there 's no more reason to go to political groups . "
film shows far-right extremism an important exception to the depoliticization in eastern germany is the rise of right-wing extremism .
neo-nazi groups have grown in the east since reunification , which freihof said was easily foreseen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazism has been a growing problem in the east " our film was the first film that showed the neo-nazis in east berlin , because that was something nobody was talking about from official side , " he said .

meanwhile , the dutch christian democrats have ratified a deal to form a government with the support of wilders ' party . populist dutch politician geert wilders , known for his strident anti-islam and anti-immigration views , held a speech in a berlin hotel on saturday amid protests outside the venue .
" germany too needs a political movement that defends the national identity of the country . germany 's political identity , its economic success , is threatened by islam , " wilders told an audience of some 500 people at a hotel in berlin 's tiergarten district .
" islam is a dangerous political ideology for everyone , " wilders , who is facing prosecution in the netherlands for incitement to hatred , said .
visit triggers protests the 47-year-old was invited to berlin by a party founded in september by rene stadtkewitz , a former member of angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- who is also a critic of islam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing activists in berlin protested against wilders ' visit the event sparked protests in front of the hotel .
police said some more than 100 demonstrators holding up banners reading " berlin against nazis - it 's our right to stop them " and " send geert wilders home " rallied in front of the hotel . wilders claims islam is a totalitarian religion and advocates banning the koran , the burqa and the construction of mosques .
wilders ' party gets boost on saturday , delegates at a congress of the dutch christian democratic appeal -lrb- cda -rrb- in the netherlands voted overwhelmingly in favour of entering a center-right governing coalition which would rely on the support of wilders ' freedom party -lrb- pvv -rrb- .
june 's general election delivered a surge of support for the freedom party , which won the third biggest share of the seats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal paves the way for a dutch minority government supported by wilders ' party earlier this week , the liberal vvd and wilders ' pvv approved the deal which makes concessions to wilders such as allowing the netherlands to ban the full islamic veil .
the liberals -lrb- vvd -rrb- and cda , which hold 52 seats in the 150-member parliament , would rely on wilders ' 24 freedom party -lrb- pvv -rrb- mps to get legislation passed .
saturday 's vote was preceded by heated debate and objections by some members of the cda opposed to cooperating with wilders ' party .
merkel distances herself from wilders ' visit german lawmaker rene stadtkewitz formed his freedom party amid a heated national debate over integration , particularly in relation to muslims . a controversial book by former german central bank board member thilo sarrazin claiming that muslims were undermining german society thrust the subject into the spotlight last month .
the german government has distanced itself from wilders and the invitation by stadtkewitz to invite him to berlin .
" it is not our style to utterly condemn any religion , " german chancellor angela merkel said through her spokesman steffen seibert in berlin .
merkel had previously told the committee on european affairs of the bundestag parliament that she regretted the formation of a minority dutch coalition government which depends on wilders ' party to win key votes .
the event comes as fears mounts among german mainstream political parties of the emergence of a new anti-immigration , anti-islam right wing movement . author : richard connor -lrb- ap / afp / reuters / dpa -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now on show is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel . the largest collection of works from the german expressionist group die bruecke -lrb- " the bridge " -rrb- is housed in a modest , one-story building on the outskirts of berlin . the bruecke collective was founded in dresden in 1905 by four university students , who abandoned their studies to devote themselves to art . the founders - ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz beyl , erich heckel , and karl schmidt-rotluff - were obsessed with the desire to create a new type of art that , in their words , was " immediate and pure . " " their goal was to revolutionize art , and they did revolutionize german art because they wanted to portray inner emotions and their subjective perceptions and that was something very new at the time , " art academic kathy stoike told deutsche welle . the way the artists depicted objects and people was very new , and not understood at the time , stoike pointed out . " you see a storm of colors , and you have to imagine that the people in 1905 did n't have any color photography , any movies , and the neon lights you have today , they did n't exist , " she said .
" it was all a bit darker , and black and white . " from the heart to the canvas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this painting , " roman stilllife , " by erich heckel was stolen from the bruecke musuem in 2002 bruecke artists strove to capture their inner perception on canvas - not what they saw , but what they felt . painted by schmitt-rottluff , a sailboat seascape becomes a kaleidoscope of swirling colors , which evoke the joy and magic of a summer day at sea .
a reclining nude by kirchner , painted with bold , impulsive strokes of bright red , the shadows of her curves in blue and green , is striking and sensual , comforting and warm . the artists rejected not only the established conventions and aesthetics of classical art , but also its techniques , devising their own painting methods as they went along . though in terms of creative expression their techniques were very effective , they were also impractical , bruecke museum director magdalena moeller explained . " the artists were self-taught , " she remarked .
" they studied architecture , not art , and did n't know how to prepare canvases or work with oil paint . " the artists simply applied the paint right from the tube to the canvas .
" this was a completely unorthodox way to work with oil paints , " she said .
" and this is also why their paintings are so fragile ; the paint is not stabile on the canvas , and why today these works must be transported with such care . " bruecke at its climax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " farn in the marsch " by emil nolde , one of the great 20th-century water color painters up until 1910 , the group had developed a distinct collective style , taking as their subjects the natural beauty of landscapes and the human form .
each artist had his own individual technique , yet their works as a whole from this period possess simplicity of depiction , vibrant use of color and exquisite compositional harmony .
this period is seen as the climax of the bruecke 's artistic achievements . the bruecke artists moved to berlin in 1911 , where big city life greatly influenced their work .
sharp angles , edgy , brittle brushwork and a subdued color palette became their defining stylistic elements .
they focused on street scenes and austere portraits . in 1913 , personal and professional differences caused the group to disband , but the artists continued to work separately , with each gaining individual recognition by the 1920s . " of course in the ' 30s with the national socialists , they were all defamed as ' degenerate ' artists , " stoike said .
" they were re-established after the second world war , but figurative art was no longer favored then since it had been exploited by the nazis for propaganda reasons . " the art of the bruecke , although expressionistic , proved too figurative for the times and fell out of fashion .
tastes for more abstract art were developing , with artists like wassily kandinsky grabbing attention on the world art stage . still , over time , the bruecke became synonymous with the german expressionist movement , and took its rightful place within the international avant-garde . renewed bruecke popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city life influenced their work , like kirchner 's " berlin street scene " these days , the bruecke is enjoying a new surge of international popularity , claims museum director moeller .
her museum has recently had an increase in requests for loans of up to 150 works from renowned art institutions around the world , such as moscow 's pushkin museum , london 's royal academy and new york 's museum of modern art , to name a few . even the french are acquiring a taste for early german expressionists , with the first bruecke exhibition ever to take place in france next year . moeller said it was the simplicity and straight-forwardness of bruecke art that made it so appealing today .
" it 's not abstract or complicated or burdened with problems the viewer has to interpret ; nor is bruecke art a conceptual art so that you need additional knowledge to understand , " she pointed out . viewers can just sit back , relax and take in the vibrant colors and clear , simple lines .
the unorthodox approach to art created back then was a stroke of fate , stoike explained . " it was a movement against the bourgeoisie society , " stoike said .
" the artists loved to work outside , close to nature and inspired by it .
i like to think of them as the first hippies , long before those of the 1960s . " author : leah mcdonnell -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen the latest exhibition at the bruecke museum is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel , combining works from its own collection as well as those on loan from the united states , england and europe .

now on show is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel . the largest collection of works from the german expressionist group die bruecke -lrb- " the bridge " -rrb- is housed in a modest , one-story building on the outskirts of berlin . the bruecke collective was founded in dresden in 1905 by four university students , who abandoned their studies to devote themselves to art . the founders - ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz beyl , erich heckel , and karl schmidt-rotluff - were obsessed with the desire to create a new type of art that , in their words , was " immediate and pure . " " their goal was to revolutionize art , and they did revolutionize german art because they wanted to portray inner emotions and their subjective perceptions and that was something very new at the time , " art academic kathy stoike told deutsche welle . the way the artists depicted objects and people was very new , and not understood at the time , stoike pointed out . " you see a storm of colors , and you have to imagine that the people in 1905 did n't have any color photography , any movies , and the neon lights you have today , they did n't exist , " she said .
" it was all a bit darker , and black and white . " from the heart to the canvas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this painting , " roman stilllife , " by erich heckel was stolen from the bruecke musuem in 2002 bruecke artists strove to capture their inner perception on canvas - not what they saw , but what they felt . painted by schmitt-rottluff , a sailboat seascape becomes a kaleidoscope of swirling colors , which evoke the joy and magic of a summer day at sea .
a reclining nude by kirchner , painted with bold , impulsive strokes of bright red , the shadows of her curves in blue and green , is striking and sensual , comforting and warm . the artists rejected not only the established conventions and aesthetics of classical art , but also its techniques , devising their own painting methods as they went along . though in terms of creative expression their techniques were very effective , they were also impractical , bruecke museum director magdalena moeller explained . " the artists were self-taught , " she remarked .
" they studied architecture , not art , and did n't know how to prepare canvases or work with oil paint . " the artists simply applied the paint right from the tube to the canvas .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ashton commited to two-state solution within one year senior officials in both washington and brussels have made clear that they want israel to extend the moratorium on settlement building .
its expiry last sunday prompted palestinian threats to quit the talks , which were launched four weeks ago in washington . " i have urged israel to continue the moratorium and to allow the talks more time to make great progress , " ashton said after a series of meetings on thursday and friday with mitchell , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu , palestinian president mahmoud abbas and palestinian premier salam fayyad . security guarantees rejected israeli media reports said that netanyahu rejected security guarantees , including new weaponry , proposed by the obama administration in exchange for a 60-day extension of the moratorium . the israeli daily yediot ahronot said washington promised to support an israeli demand to leave troops along the border of a future palestinian state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house denied it had offered security guarantees the palestinians reportedly received assurances from the white house that a future palestinian state would have its borders across the territory seized by israel in the 1967 six-day war . " those of us that have been engaged in the process have been very concerned that the ending of the moratorium should not put at risk the possibility of long-term peace , " ashton said , describing her talks as " positive and constructive . " netanyahu , whose governing coalition is dominated by settler supporters , has said he is willing to discuss settlements as a final status issue . after friday 's talks failed to reach a compromise , mitchell left the region for talks with arab leaders .
on wednesday , the arab league had been scheduled to meet in cairo to decide whether to extend its support for direct negotiations between israel and the palestinians .

german daily sueddeutsche zeitung had reported that siemens said the 15 companies had discovered the virus and informed siemens of the incidents .
the paper said five of those clients had their head office in germany .
the incidents were reported a month ago , but siemens said that the virus is not causing problems anymore , according to the paper .
germany 's biggest utitlities rwe and e.on were not affected by the virus .
the company said they succeeded in isolating the virus at a test facility for further study .
" our analyses have not yielded any conclusions on the specific purpose or the maker of the virus , " siemens told the paper .
sophisticated virus the virus has so far infected computers in indonesia , india , the united states , australia , britain , malaysia and pakistan .
the biggest target , however , has been iran and some believe the virus was designed to attack iran 's nuclear facilities .
the malware spreads via infected usb thumb drive memory sticks , exploiting vulnerabilities in the microsoft windows operating system .
the super-virus attacks software programs that run on supervisory control and data acquisition , or scada , systems , a product developed by siemens and sold around the world , including to iran .
scada is used to manage water supplies , oil rigs , power plants and other industrial facilities .
once the worm infects a system , it quickly sets up communications with a remote server computer that can be used to steal proprietary information or take control of the scada system .

meanwhile , the dutch christian democrats have ratified a deal to form a government with the support of wilders ' party . populist dutch politician geert wilders , known for his strident anti-islam and anti-immigration views , held a speech in a berlin hotel on saturday amid protests outside the venue .
" germany too needs a political movement that defends the national identity of the country . germany 's political identity , its economic success , is threatened by islam , " wilders told an audience of some 500 people at a hotel in berlin 's tiergarten district .
" islam is a dangerous political ideology for everyone , " wilders , who is facing prosecution in the netherlands for incitement to hatred , said .
visit triggers protests the 47-year-old was invited to berlin by a party founded in september by rene stadtkewitz , a former member of angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- who is also a critic of islam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing activists in berlin protested against wilders ' visit the event sparked protests in front of the hotel .
police said some more than 100 demonstrators holding up banners reading " berlin against nazis - it 's our right to stop them " and " send geert wilders home " rallied in front of the hotel . wilders claims islam is a totalitarian religion and advocates banning the koran , the burqa and the construction of mosques .
wilders ' party gets boost on saturday , delegates at a congress of the dutch christian democratic appeal -lrb- cda -rrb- in the netherlands voted overwhelmingly in favour of entering a center-right governing coalition which would rely on the support of wilders ' freedom party -lrb- pvv -rrb- .
june 's general election delivered a surge of support for the freedom party , which won the third biggest share of the seats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal paves the way for a dutch minority government supported by wilders ' party earlier this week , the liberal vvd and wilders ' pvv approved the deal which makes concessions to wilders such as allowing the netherlands to ban the full islamic veil .
the liberals -lrb- vvd -rrb- and cda , which hold 52 seats in the 150-member parliament , would rely on wilders ' 24 freedom party -lrb- pvv -rrb- mps to get legislation passed .
saturday 's vote was preceded by heated debate and objections by some members of the cda opposed to cooperating with wilders ' party .
merkel distances herself from wilders ' visit german lawmaker rene stadtkewitz formed his freedom party amid a heated national debate over integration , particularly in relation to muslims . a controversial book by former german central bank board member thilo sarrazin claiming that muslims were undermining german society thrust the subject into the spotlight last month .
the german government has distanced itself from wilders and the invitation by stadtkewitz to invite him to berlin .
" it is not our style to utterly condemn any religion , " german chancellor angela merkel said through her spokesman steffen seibert in berlin .
merkel had previously told the committee on european affairs of the bundestag parliament that she regretted the formation of a minority dutch coalition government which depends on wilders ' party to win key votes .
the event comes as fears mounts among german mainstream political parties of the emergence of a new anti-immigration , anti-islam right wing movement . author : richard connor -lrb- ap / afp / reuters / dpa -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians have been urging germans to celebrate the accomplishments achieved in the united country over the past two decades . on october 3 , 1990 germany was officially reunified after four decades of division into the soviet-controlled communist german democratic republic in the east and the federal republic of germany in the west .
the berlin wall had fallen just 11 months earlier when germans celebrated their reunited status in front of the bundestag , or parliament , in berlin .
october 3 has been a public holiday since , with the northern port city of bremen this year taking its turn as the lead city for the celebrations .
the city has been turned into a venue for concerts , street parties , parades and appearances by leading politicians .
" today , we remember the brave citizens who fought for freedom .
that 's why we 're celebrating today with a citizens ' festival , " bremen mayor and the current president of the upper house of the german parliament , jens boehrnsen said on saturday as he kicked off the festivities .
in the market square , a version of the berlin wall has been erected to display images and texts showing the story of the country 's division and reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surrounded by students , bremen mayor boehrnsen kicked off celebrations among the high points of the celebrations set to take place over the weekend are a firework display on saturday evening along with a performance by 1980s german pop sensation nena .
protests mainly peaceful around 1,500 mainly left-wing demonstrators held protests in bremen on saturday , coinciding with celebrations for the 20th anniversary of german reunification . under the motto " october 3rd is not a day to celebrate " the demonstrators marched through bremen 's city-center .
fireworks and bottles were thrown but a police spokesman said fears of large-scale riots did not materialize . ahead of the weekend celebrations leftists groups and anarchists had threatened to launch attacks and civil unrest . merkel emphasizes solidarity chancellor angela merkel and german president christian wulff are due to give speeches on sunday , with a church service also planned .
all 16 of germany 's states and cities were being represented at the festival venue .
in her weekly video address , merkel urged germans to value the freedom and democracy reunification brought to eastern germany and not just complain about the costs .
" for people from the former gdr -lrb- german democratic republic -rrb- almost everything has changed , " she said , noting the " wave of solidarity " from the former west germany .
" it 's thanks to these joint efforts that we 've been able to rebuild so quickly , " she added .
in an interview with daily bild am sonntag , merkel said she wished people in the west would appreciate more what people in the former east had achieved .
" it 's a shame that some people still do n't understand that the gdr regime was one thing , but the individual people and their achievements are another . "
speaking ahead of the anniversary , president wulff said : " 20 years of german unity is an occasion to celebrate , but also to pause for thought .
the changes that have occurred in our country in this time are immense , particularly in the east . " famous landmark is a focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl presided over the process of german reunification in berlin , the brandenburg gate is the focal point for an entertainment program , with stage shows and attractions lined up along the avenue leading to the landmark .
as the country prepared for the occasion , there was a rare speech on friday from former chancellor helmut kohl , who is known in germany as " the reunification chancellor . "
kohl , aged 80 and now confined to a wheelchair , spoke of the significance of the occasion to a meeting of christian democratic party colleagues .
" these dates are an occasion to take pleasure in what we have achieved , to remember with gratitude and pride where we have come from and also to look forward together , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 02.10.2010 the ' bruecke ' artists revolutionized german art with vibrant colors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " two girls by the water " by erich heckel the bruecke museum is a treasure trove of german expressionist art , with the movement 's artists having helped redefine the craft in the early 20th century .
now on show is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel . the largest collection of works from the german expressionist group die bruecke -lrb- " the bridge " -rrb- is housed in a modest , one-story building on the outskirts of berlin . the bruecke collective was founded in dresden in 1905 by four university students , who abandoned their studies to devote themselves to art . the founders - ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz beyl , erich heckel , and karl schmidt-rotluff - were obsessed with the desire to create a new type of art that , in their words , was " immediate and pure . " " their goal was to revolutionize art , and they did revolutionize german art because they wanted to portray inner emotions and their subjective perceptions and that was something very new at the time , " art academic kathy stoike told deutsche welle . the way the artists depicted objects and people was very new , and not understood at the time , stoike pointed out . " you see a storm of colors , and you have to imagine that the people in 1905 did n't have any color photography , any movies , and the neon lights you have today , they did n't exist , " she said .
" it was all a bit darker , and black and white . " from the heart to the canvas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this painting , " roman stilllife , " by erich heckel was stolen from the bruecke musuem in 2002 bruecke artists strove to capture their inner perception on canvas - not what they saw , but what they felt . painted by schmitt-rottluff , a sailboat seascape becomes a kaleidoscope of swirling colors , which evoke the joy and magic of a summer day at sea .
a reclining nude by kirchner , painted with bold , impulsive strokes of bright red , the shadows of her curves in blue and green , is striking and sensual , comforting and warm . the artists rejected not only the established conventions and aesthetics of classical art , but also its techniques , devising their own painting methods as they went along . though in terms of creative expression their techniques were very effective , they were also impractical , bruecke museum director magdalena moeller explained . " the artists were self-taught , " she remarked .
" they studied architecture , not art , and did n't know how to prepare canvases or work with oil paint . " the artists simply applied the paint right from the tube to the canvas .
" this was a completely unorthodox way to work with oil paints , " she said .
" and this is also why their paintings are so fragile ; the paint is not stabile on the canvas , and why today these works must be transported with such care . " bruecke at its climax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " farn in the marsch " by emil nolde , one of the great 20th-century water color painters up until 1910 , the group had developed a distinct collective style , taking as their subjects the natural beauty of landscapes and the human form .
each artist had his own individual technique , yet their works as a whole from this period possess simplicity of depiction , vibrant use of color and exquisite compositional harmony .
this period is seen as the climax of the bruecke 's artistic achievements . the bruecke artists moved to berlin in 1911 , where big city life greatly influenced their work .
sharp angles , edgy , brittle brushwork and a subdued color palette became their defining stylistic elements .
they focused on street scenes and austere portraits . in 1913 , personal and professional differences caused the group to disband , but the artists continued to work separately , with each gaining individual recognition by the 1920s . " of course in the ' 30s with the national socialists , they were all defamed as ' degenerate ' artists , " stoike said .
" they were re-established after the second world war , but figurative art was no longer favored then since it had been exploited by the nazis for propaganda reasons . " the art of the bruecke , although expressionistic , proved too figurative for the times and fell out of fashion .
tastes for more abstract art were developing , with artists like wassily kandinsky grabbing attention on the world art stage . still , over time , the bruecke became synonymous with the german expressionist movement , and took its rightful place within the international avant-garde . renewed bruecke popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city life influenced their work , like kirchner 's " berlin street scene " these days , the bruecke is enjoying a new surge of international popularity , claims museum director moeller .
her museum has recently had an increase in requests for loans of up to 150 works from renowned art institutions around the world , such as moscow 's pushkin museum , london 's royal academy and new york 's museum of modern art , to name a few . even the french are acquiring a taste for early german expressionists , with the first bruecke exhibition ever to take place in france next year . moeller said it was the simplicity and straight-forwardness of bruecke art that made it so appealing today .
" it 's not abstract or complicated or burdened with problems the viewer has to interpret ; nor is bruecke art a conceptual art so that you need additional knowledge to understand , " she pointed out . viewers can just sit back , relax and take in the vibrant colors and clear , simple lines .
the unorthodox approach to art created back then was a stroke of fate , stoike explained . " it was a movement against the bourgeoisie society , " stoike said .
" the artists loved to work outside , close to nature and inspired by it .
i like to think of them as the first hippies , long before those of the 1960s . " author : leah mcdonnell -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen the latest exhibition at the bruecke museum is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel , combining works from its own collection as well as those on loan from the united states , england and europe .

german daily sueddeutsche zeitung had reported that siemens said the 15 companies had discovered the virus and informed siemens of the incidents .
the paper said five of those clients had their head office in germany .
the incidents were reported a month ago , but siemens said that the virus is not causing problems anymore , according to the paper .
germany 's biggest utitlities rwe and e.on were not affected by the virus .
the company said they succeeded in isolating the virus at a test facility for further study .
" our analyses have not yielded any conclusions on the specific purpose or the maker of the virus , " siemens told the paper .
sophisticated virus the virus has so far infected computers in indonesia , india , the united states , australia , britain , malaysia and pakistan .
the biggest target , however , has been iran and some believe the virus was designed to attack iran 's nuclear facilities .
the malware spreads via infected usb thumb drive memory sticks , exploiting vulnerabilities in the microsoft windows operating system .
the super-virus attacks software programs that run on supervisory control and data acquisition , or scada , systems , a product developed by siemens and sold around the world , including to iran .
scada is used to manage water supplies , oil rigs , power plants and other industrial facilities .
once the worm infects a system , it quickly sets up communications with a remote server computer that can be used to steal proprietary information or take control of the scada system .

politicians have been urging germans to celebrate the accomplishments achieved in the united country over the past two decades . on october 3 , 1990 germany was officially reunified after four decades of division into the soviet-controlled communist german democratic republic in the east and the federal republic of germany in the west .
the berlin wall had fallen just 11 months earlier when germans celebrated their reunited status in front of the bundestag , or parliament , in berlin .
october 3 has been a public holiday since , with the northern port city of bremen this year taking its turn as the lead city for the celebrations .
the city has been turned into a venue for concerts , street parties , parades and appearances by leading politicians .
" today , we remember the brave citizens who fought for freedom .
that 's why we 're celebrating today with a citizens ' festival , " bremen mayor and the current president of the upper house of the german parliament , jens boehrnsen said on saturday as he kicked off the festivities .
in the market square , a version of the berlin wall has been erected to display images and texts showing the story of the country 's division and reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surrounded by students , bremen mayor boehrnsen kicked off celebrations among the high points of the celebrations set to take place over the weekend are a firework display on saturday evening along with a performance by 1980s german pop sensation nena .
protests mainly peaceful around 1,500 mainly left-wing demonstrators held protests in bremen on saturday , coinciding with celebrations for the 20th anniversary of german reunification . under the motto " october 3rd is not a day to celebrate " the demonstrators marched through bremen 's city-center .
fireworks and bottles were thrown but a police spokesman said fears of large-scale riots did not materialize . ahead of the weekend celebrations leftists groups and anarchists had threatened to launch attacks and civil unrest . merkel emphasizes solidarity chancellor angela merkel and german president christian wulff are due to give speeches on sunday , with a church service also planned .
all 16 of germany 's states and cities were being represented at the festival venue .
in her weekly video address , merkel urged germans to value the freedom and democracy reunification brought to eastern germany and not just complain about the costs .
" for people from the former gdr -lrb- german democratic republic -rrb- almost everything has changed , " she said , noting the " wave of solidarity " from the former west germany .
" it 's thanks to these joint efforts that we 've been able to rebuild so quickly , " she added .
in an interview with daily bild am sonntag , merkel said she wished people in the west would appreciate more what people in the former east had achieved .
" it 's a shame that some people still do n't understand that the gdr regime was one thing , but the individual people and their achievements are another . "
speaking ahead of the anniversary , president wulff said : " 20 years of german unity is an occasion to celebrate , but also to pause for thought .
the changes that have occurred in our country in this time are immense , particularly in the east . " famous landmark is a focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl presided over the process of german reunification in berlin , the brandenburg gate is the focal point for an entertainment program , with stage shows and attractions lined up along the avenue leading to the landmark .
as the country prepared for the occasion , there was a rare speech on friday from former chancellor helmut kohl , who is known in germany as " the reunification chancellor . "
kohl , aged 80 and now confined to a wheelchair , spoke of the significance of the occasion to a meeting of christian democratic party colleagues .
" these dates are an occasion to take pleasure in what we have achieved , to remember with gratitude and pride where we have come from and also to look forward together , " he said .

german daily sueddeutsche zeitung had reported that siemens said the 15 companies had discovered the virus and informed siemens of the incidents .
the paper said five of those clients had their head office in germany .
the incidents were reported a month ago , but siemens said that the virus is not causing problems anymore , according to the paper .
germany 's biggest utitlities rwe and e.on were not affected by the virus .
the company said they succeeded in isolating the virus at a test facility for further study .
" our analyses have not yielded any conclusions on the specific purpose or the maker of the virus , " siemens told the paper .
sophisticated virus the virus has so far infected computers in indonesia , india , the united states , australia , britain , malaysia and pakistan .
the biggest target , however , has been iran and some believe the virus was designed to attack iran 's nuclear facilities .
the malware spreads via infected usb thumb drive memory sticks , exploiting vulnerabilities in the microsoft windows operating system .
the super-virus attacks software programs that run on supervisory control and data acquisition , or scada , systems , a product developed by siemens and sold around the world , including to iran .
scada is used to manage water supplies , oil rigs , power plants and other industrial facilities .
once the worm infects a system , it quickly sets up communications with a remote server computer that can be used to steal proprietary information or take control of the scada system .

politicians have been urging germans to celebrate the accomplishments achieved in the united country over the past two decades . on october 3 , 1990 germany was officially reunified after four decades of division into the soviet-controlled communist german democratic republic in the east and the federal republic of germany in the west .
the berlin wall had fallen just 11 months earlier when germans celebrated their reunited status in front of the bundestag , or parliament , in berlin .
october 3 has been a public holiday since , with the northern port city of bremen this year taking its turn as the lead city for the celebrations .
the city has been turned into a venue for concerts , street parties , parades and appearances by leading politicians .
" today , we remember the brave citizens who fought for freedom .
that 's why we 're celebrating today with a citizens ' festival , " bremen mayor and the current president of the upper house of the german parliament , jens boehrnsen said on saturday as he kicked off the festivities .
in the market square , a version of the berlin wall has been erected to display images and texts showing the story of the country 's division and reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surrounded by students , bremen mayor boehrnsen kicked off celebrations among the high points of the celebrations set to take place over the weekend are a firework display on saturday evening along with a performance by 1980s german pop sensation nena .
protests mainly peaceful around 1,500 mainly left-wing demonstrators held protests in bremen on saturday , coinciding with celebrations for the 20th anniversary of german reunification . under the motto " october 3rd is not a day to celebrate " the demonstrators marched through bremen 's city-center .
fireworks and bottles were thrown but a police spokesman said fears of large-scale riots did not materialize . ahead of the weekend celebrations leftists groups and anarchists had threatened to launch attacks and civil unrest . merkel emphasizes solidarity chancellor angela merkel and german president christian wulff are due to give speeches on sunday , with a church service also planned .
all 16 of germany 's states and cities were being represented at the festival venue .
in her weekly video address , merkel urged germans to value the freedom and democracy reunification brought to eastern germany and not just complain about the costs .
" for people from the former gdr -lrb- german democratic republic -rrb- almost everything has changed , " she said , noting the " wave of solidarity " from the former west germany .
" it 's thanks to these joint efforts that we 've been able to rebuild so quickly , " she added .
in an interview with daily bild am sonntag , merkel said she wished people in the west would appreciate more what people in the former east had achieved .
" it 's a shame that some people still do n't understand that the gdr regime was one thing , but the individual people and their achievements are another . "
speaking ahead of the anniversary , president wulff said : " 20 years of german unity is an occasion to celebrate , but also to pause for thought .
the changes that have occurred in our country in this time are immense , particularly in the east . " famous landmark is a focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl presided over the process of german reunification in berlin , the brandenburg gate is the focal point for an entertainment program , with stage shows and attractions lined up along the avenue leading to the landmark .
as the country prepared for the occasion , there was a rare speech on friday from former chancellor helmut kohl , who is known in germany as " the reunification chancellor . "
kohl , aged 80 and now confined to a wheelchair , spoke of the significance of the occasion to a meeting of christian democratic party colleagues .
" these dates are an occasion to take pleasure in what we have achieved , to remember with gratitude and pride where we have come from and also to look forward together , " he said .

german daily sueddeutsche zeitung had reported that siemens said the 15 companies had discovered the virus and informed siemens of the incidents .
the paper said five of those clients had their head office in germany .
the incidents were reported a month ago , but siemens said that the virus is not causing problems anymore , according to the paper .
germany 's biggest utitlities rwe and e.on were not affected by the virus .
the company said they succeeded in isolating the virus at a test facility for further study .
" our analyses have not yielded any conclusions on the specific purpose or the maker of the virus , " siemens told the paper .
sophisticated virus the virus has so far infected computers in indonesia , india , the united states , australia , britain , malaysia and pakistan .
the biggest target , however , has been iran and some believe the virus was designed to attack iran 's nuclear facilities .
the malware spreads via infected usb thumb drive memory sticks , exploiting vulnerabilities in the microsoft windows operating system .
the super-virus attacks software programs that run on supervisory control and data acquisition , or scada , systems , a product developed by siemens and sold around the world , including to iran .
scada is used to manage water supplies , oil rigs , power plants and other industrial facilities .
once the worm infects a system , it quickly sets up communications with a remote server computer that can be used to steal proprietary information or take control of the scada system .

but important differences in gay life still remain . as germany celebrates the 20th anniversary of reunification , the former east-west divide in the country 's gay and lesbian rights movement has all but disappeared .
there is currently close cooperation between gay and lesbian activists in the eastern and western states , according to eduard stapel , founder of several gay rights groups in former east germany .
unlike the united states , where gay rights vary widely from state to state , the legal rights of gays and lesbians are virtually the same in the east and west .
" that 's apart from the fact that we 've made slightly more progress in eastern germany , with discrimination bans in the berlin , brandenburg and thuringia state constitutions , " stapel told deutsche welle .
" but that has little effect on everyday life . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays in berlin enjoy one of the most accepting environments social acceptance of homosexuality is also roughly the same in eastern and western states , according to a 2001 study by the opinion research group tns emnid .
the study found that nearly the same percentage of people in the east as in the west say homosexuality is no longer objectionable .
the highest percentage of acceptance was in berlin , while the lowest was in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
gay life in former east germany while there is very little documentation of gay life in former east germany , a unique exception is the 1989 film " coming out . "
it follows a young teacher in east berlin struggling to accept his gay identity , and was the first and only gay-themed film produced in east germany .
it also won the second-place silver bear prize in the 1990 berlin film festival .
the film 's premiere was coincidentally held on november 9 , 1989 , the same night east german authorities opened the border to the west and people from across germany began to tear down the berlin wall .
matthias freihof , who played the protagonist phillip , said when he was first offered the leading role in the film , he knew it would be a major boost to his career .
the director , heiner carow , was one of the most well-known and respected directors in all of east germany .
what freihof did not anticipate was the long-lasting effect " coming out " would have on gay cinema .
bildunterschrift : " coming out " won the silver bear award at the 1990 berlin film festival " i 'm on the way to different festivals almost every year , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is very astonishing for me , that this film still has the power to entertain people , to pull them into the story . "
" coming out " was made at a time of huge political upheaval in all of eastern europe , just as the east german gay and lesbian community was becoming more visible .
the first gay-themed theater production , a growing number of books and resources on homosexuality all marked the beginnings of an organized gay rights movement .
" there was a kind of liberation coming up in the early 80s , so the step to do a film about this subject was clear , " freihof said .
" but the officials did n't like the idea , of course , because they knew about the subject , but they did n't want to make a big thing out of it . "
reunification depoliticizes the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stapel founded many east german gay organizations under a repressive government , political activism actually flourished in east germany , stapel said .
gays rights activists , alongside feminists , human rights activists and environmentalists , formed a strong and unified civil rights movement that opposed the east german authoritarian state .
political activism there filled the void left by the absence of a real social scene , like bars , restaurants and movie theaters , stapel said .
but after the fall of the berlin wall and the emergence of capitalism in east germany , the gay community became less political and less organized .
" people in communist east germany would go wherever things were happening , and that was the case with political groups , " stapel said .
" but when all of a sudden there is a social scene , then there 's no more reason to go to political groups . "
film shows far-right extremism an important exception to the depoliticization in eastern germany is the rise of right-wing extremism .
neo-nazi groups have grown in the east since reunification , which freihof said was easily foreseen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazism has been a growing problem in the east " our film was the first film that showed the neo-nazis in east berlin , because that was something nobody was talking about from official side , " he said .
" so after the wall came down , this problem became bigger and bigger , and for us it was not surprising . "
in one scene of " coming out , " freihof 's character phillip witnesses a group of neo-nazis attacking a young man they believe is gay in a subway station .
such attacks were not uncommon , freihof said , as far-right groups became more active and increasingly targeted the gay community .
" it happened sometimes that neo-nazi groups went to gay places to fight with the people , " freihof said .
but the rise of right-wing extremism in the east since reunification and its influence on violence against gays should not be overstated , according to stapel .
one of the more pressing concerns there is discrimination in the workplace .

but important differences in gay life still remain . as germany celebrates the 20th anniversary of reunification , the former east-west divide in the country 's gay and lesbian rights movement has all but disappeared .
there is currently close cooperation between gay and lesbian activists in the eastern and western states , according to eduard stapel , founder of several gay rights groups in former east germany .
unlike the united states , where gay rights vary widely from state to state , the legal rights of gays and lesbians are virtually the same in the east and west .
" that 's apart from the fact that we 've made slightly more progress in eastern germany , with discrimination bans in the berlin , brandenburg and thuringia state constitutions , " stapel told deutsche welle .
" but that has little effect on everyday life . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays in berlin enjoy one of the most accepting environments social acceptance of homosexuality is also roughly the same in eastern and western states , according to a 2001 study by the opinion research group tns emnid .
the study found that nearly the same percentage of people in the east as in the west say homosexuality is no longer objectionable .
the highest percentage of acceptance was in berlin , while the lowest was in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
gay life in former east germany while there is very little documentation of gay life in former east germany , a unique exception is the 1989 film " coming out . "
it follows a young teacher in east berlin struggling to accept his gay identity , and was the first and only gay-themed film produced in east germany .
it also won the second-place silver bear prize in the 1990 berlin film festival .
the film 's premiere was coincidentally held on november 9 , 1989 , the same night east german authorities opened the border to the west and people from across germany began to tear down the berlin wall .
matthias freihof , who played the protagonist phillip , said when he was first offered the leading role in the film , he knew it would be a major boost to his career .
the director , heiner carow , was one of the most well-known and respected directors in all of east germany .
what freihof did not anticipate was the long-lasting effect " coming out " would have on gay cinema .
bildunterschrift : " coming out " won the silver bear award at the 1990 berlin film festival " i 'm on the way to different festivals almost every year , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is very astonishing for me , that this film still has the power to entertain people , to pull them into the story . "
" coming out " was made at a time of huge political upheaval in all of eastern europe , just as the east german gay and lesbian community was becoming more visible .
the first gay-themed theater production , a growing number of books and resources on homosexuality all marked the beginnings of an organized gay rights movement .
" there was a kind of liberation coming up in the early 80s , so the step to do a film about this subject was clear , " freihof said .
" but the officials did n't like the idea , of course , because they knew about the subject , but they did n't want to make a big thing out of it . "
reunification depoliticizes the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stapel founded many east german gay organizations under a repressive government , political activism actually flourished in east germany , stapel said .
gays rights activists , alongside feminists , human rights activists and environmentalists , formed a strong and unified civil rights movement that opposed the east german authoritarian state .
political activism there filled the void left by the absence of a real social scene , like bars , restaurants and movie theaters , stapel said .
but after the fall of the berlin wall and the emergence of capitalism in east germany , the gay community became less political and less organized .
" people in communist east germany would go wherever things were happening , and that was the case with political groups , " stapel said .
" but when all of a sudden there is a social scene , then there 's no more reason to go to political groups . "
film shows far-right extremism an important exception to the depoliticization in eastern germany is the rise of right-wing extremism .
neo-nazi groups have grown in the east since reunification , which freihof said was easily foreseen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazism has been a growing problem in the east " our film was the first film that showed the neo-nazis in east berlin , because that was something nobody was talking about from official side , " he said .
" so after the wall came down , this problem became bigger and bigger , and for us it was not surprising . "
in one scene of " coming out , " freihof 's character phillip witnesses a group of neo-nazis attacking a young man they believe is gay in a subway station .
such attacks were not uncommon , freihof said , as far-right groups became more active and increasingly targeted the gay community .
" it happened sometimes that neo-nazi groups went to gay places to fight with the people , " freihof said .
but the rise of right-wing extremism in the east since reunification and its influence on violence against gays should not be overstated , according to stapel .
one of the more pressing concerns there is discrimination in the workplace .
" many people in the east are much more afraid now than during communism of losing their jobs because of their sexuality , " he said .
" i do n't think that 's likely , but people are afraid . " author : andrew bowen editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now on show is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel . the largest collection of works from the german expressionist group die bruecke -lrb- " the bridge " -rrb- is housed in a modest , one-story building on the outskirts of berlin . the bruecke collective was founded in dresden in 1905 by four university students , who abandoned their studies to devote themselves to art . the founders - ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz beyl , erich heckel , and karl schmidt-rotluff - were obsessed with the desire to create a new type of art that , in their words , was " immediate and pure . " " their goal was to revolutionize art , and they did revolutionize german art because they wanted to portray inner emotions and their subjective perceptions and that was something very new at the time , " art academic kathy stoike told deutsche welle . the way the artists depicted objects and people was very new , and not understood at the time , stoike pointed out . " you see a storm of colors , and you have to imagine that the people in 1905 did n't have any color photography , any movies , and the neon lights you have today , they did n't exist , " she said .
" it was all a bit darker , and black and white . " from the heart to the canvas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this painting , " roman stilllife , " by erich heckel was stolen from the bruecke musuem in 2002 bruecke artists strove to capture their inner perception on canvas - not what they saw , but what they felt . painted by schmitt-rottluff , a sailboat seascape becomes a kaleidoscope of swirling colors , which evoke the joy and magic of a summer day at sea .
a reclining nude by kirchner , painted with bold , impulsive strokes of bright red , the shadows of her curves in blue and green , is striking and sensual , comforting and warm . the artists rejected not only the established conventions and aesthetics of classical art , but also its techniques , devising their own painting methods as they went along . though in terms of creative expression their techniques were very effective , they were also impractical , bruecke museum director magdalena moeller explained . " the artists were self-taught , " she remarked .
" they studied architecture , not art , and did n't know how to prepare canvases or work with oil paint . " the artists simply applied the paint right from the tube to the canvas .
" this was a completely unorthodox way to work with oil paints , " she said .
" and this is also why their paintings are so fragile ; the paint is not stabile on the canvas , and why today these works must be transported with such care . " bruecke at its climax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " farn in the marsch " by emil nolde , one of the great 20th-century water color painters up until 1910 , the group had developed a distinct collective style , taking as their subjects the natural beauty of landscapes and the human form .
each artist had his own individual technique , yet their works as a whole from this period possess simplicity of depiction , vibrant use of color and exquisite compositional harmony .
this period is seen as the climax of the bruecke 's artistic achievements . the bruecke artists moved to berlin in 1911 , where big city life greatly influenced their work .
sharp angles , edgy , brittle brushwork and a subdued color palette became their defining stylistic elements .
they focused on street scenes and austere portraits . in 1913 , personal and professional differences caused the group to disband , but the artists continued to work separately , with each gaining individual recognition by the 1920s . " of course in the ' 30s with the national socialists , they were all defamed as ' degenerate ' artists , " stoike said .
" they were re-established after the second world war , but figurative art was no longer favored then since it had been exploited by the nazis for propaganda reasons . " the art of the bruecke , although expressionistic , proved too figurative for the times and fell out of fashion .
tastes for more abstract art were developing , with artists like wassily kandinsky grabbing attention on the world art stage . still , over time , the bruecke became synonymous with the german expressionist movement , and took its rightful place within the international avant-garde . renewed bruecke popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city life influenced their work , like kirchner 's " berlin street scene " these days , the bruecke is enjoying a new surge of international popularity , claims museum director moeller .
her museum has recently had an increase in requests for loans of up to 150 works from renowned art institutions around the world , such as moscow 's pushkin museum , london 's royal academy and new york 's museum of modern art , to name a few . even the french are acquiring a taste for early german expressionists , with the first bruecke exhibition ever to take place in france next year . moeller said it was the simplicity and straight-forwardness of bruecke art that made it so appealing today .
" it 's not abstract or complicated or burdened with problems the viewer has to interpret ; nor is bruecke art a conceptual art so that you need additional knowledge to understand , " she pointed out . viewers can just sit back , relax and take in the vibrant colors and clear , simple lines .
the unorthodox approach to art created back then was a stroke of fate , stoike explained . " it was a movement against the bourgeoisie society , " stoike said .
" the artists loved to work outside , close to nature and inspired by it .

mainz took an early lead after just two minutes , when sami allagui converted a pass by lewis holtby .
praise from loew " that pass alone was worth the cost of the ticket for this match , " national coach joachim loew , who was watching from the sidelines , said after the game .
holtby is widely expected to be selected to play for the german national team .
hoffenheim managed to equalize just before half-time , but mainz powered ahead after the break with another goal by adam szalai .

now on show is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel . the largest collection of works from the german expressionist group die bruecke -lrb- " the bridge " -rrb- is housed in a modest , one-story building on the outskirts of berlin . the bruecke collective was founded in dresden in 1905 by four university students , who abandoned their studies to devote themselves to art . the founders - ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz beyl , erich heckel , and karl schmidt-rotluff - were obsessed with the desire to create a new type of art that , in their words , was " immediate and pure . " " their goal was to revolutionize art , and they did revolutionize german art because they wanted to portray inner emotions and their subjective perceptions and that was something very new at the time , " art academic kathy stoike told deutsche welle . the way the artists depicted objects and people was very new , and not understood at the time , stoike pointed out . " you see a storm of colors , and you have to imagine that the people in 1905 did n't have any color photography , any movies , and the neon lights you have today , they did n't exist , " she said .
" it was all a bit darker , and black and white . " from the heart to the canvas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this painting , " roman stilllife , " by erich heckel was stolen from the bruecke musuem in 2002 bruecke artists strove to capture their inner perception on canvas - not what they saw , but what they felt . painted by schmitt-rottluff , a sailboat seascape becomes a kaleidoscope of swirling colors , which evoke the joy and magic of a summer day at sea .
a reclining nude by kirchner , painted with bold , impulsive strokes of bright red , the shadows of her curves in blue and green , is striking and sensual , comforting and warm . the artists rejected not only the established conventions and aesthetics of classical art , but also its techniques , devising their own painting methods as they went along . though in terms of creative expression their techniques were very effective , they were also impractical , bruecke museum director magdalena moeller explained . " the artists were self-taught , " she remarked .
" they studied architecture , not art , and did n't know how to prepare canvases or work with oil paint . " the artists simply applied the paint right from the tube to the canvas .
" this was a completely unorthodox way to work with oil paints , " she said .
" and this is also why their paintings are so fragile ; the paint is not stabile on the canvas , and why today these works must be transported with such care . " bruecke at its climax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " farn in the marsch " by emil nolde , one of the great 20th-century water color painters up until 1910 , the group had developed a distinct collective style , taking as their subjects the natural beauty of landscapes and the human form .
each artist had his own individual technique , yet their works as a whole from this period possess simplicity of depiction , vibrant use of color and exquisite compositional harmony .
this period is seen as the climax of the bruecke 's artistic achievements . the bruecke artists moved to berlin in 1911 , where big city life greatly influenced their work .
sharp angles , edgy , brittle brushwork and a subdued color palette became their defining stylistic elements .
they focused on street scenes and austere portraits . in 1913 , personal and professional differences caused the group to disband , but the artists continued to work separately , with each gaining individual recognition by the 1920s . " of course in the ' 30s with the national socialists , they were all defamed as ' degenerate ' artists , " stoike said .
" they were re-established after the second world war , but figurative art was no longer favored then since it had been exploited by the nazis for propaganda reasons . " the art of the bruecke , although expressionistic , proved too figurative for the times and fell out of fashion .
tastes for more abstract art were developing , with artists like wassily kandinsky grabbing attention on the world art stage . still , over time , the bruecke became synonymous with the german expressionist movement , and took its rightful place within the international avant-garde . renewed bruecke popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city life influenced their work , like kirchner 's " berlin street scene " these days , the bruecke is enjoying a new surge of international popularity , claims museum director moeller .
her museum has recently had an increase in requests for loans of up to 150 works from renowned art institutions around the world , such as moscow 's pushkin museum , london 's royal academy and new york 's museum of modern art , to name a few . even the french are acquiring a taste for early german expressionists , with the first bruecke exhibition ever to take place in france next year . moeller said it was the simplicity and straight-forwardness of bruecke art that made it so appealing today .
" it 's not abstract or complicated or burdened with problems the viewer has to interpret ; nor is bruecke art a conceptual art so that you need additional knowledge to understand , " she pointed out . viewers can just sit back , relax and take in the vibrant colors and clear , simple lines .
the unorthodox approach to art created back then was a stroke of fate , stoike explained . " it was a movement against the bourgeoisie society , " stoike said .
" the artists loved to work outside , close to nature and inspired by it .

sharp angles , edgy , brittle brushwork and a subdued color palette became their defining stylistic elements .
they focused on street scenes and austere portraits . in 1913 , personal and professional differences caused the group to disband , but the artists continued to work separately , with each gaining individual recognition by the 1920s . " of course in the ' 30s with the national socialists , they were all defamed as ' degenerate ' artists , " stoike said .
" they were re-established after the second world war , but figurative art was no longer favored then since it had been exploited by the nazis for propaganda reasons . " the art of the bruecke , although expressionistic , proved too figurative for the times and fell out of fashion .
tastes for more abstract art were developing , with artists like wassily kandinsky grabbing attention on the world art stage . still , over time , the bruecke became synonymous with the german expressionist movement , and took its rightful place within the international avant-garde . renewed bruecke popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city life influenced their work , like kirchner 's " berlin street scene " these days , the bruecke is enjoying a new surge of international popularity , claims museum director moeller .
her museum has recently had an increase in requests for loans of up to 150 works from renowned art institutions around the world , such as moscow 's pushkin museum , london 's royal academy and new york 's museum of modern art , to name a few . even the french are acquiring a taste for early german expressionists , with the first bruecke exhibition ever to take place in france next year . moeller said it was the simplicity and straight-forwardness of bruecke art that made it so appealing today .
" it 's not abstract or complicated or burdened with problems the viewer has to interpret ; nor is bruecke art a conceptual art so that you need additional knowledge to understand , " she pointed out . viewers can just sit back , relax and take in the vibrant colors and clear , simple lines .
the unorthodox approach to art created back then was a stroke of fate , stoike explained . " it was a movement against the bourgeoisie society , " stoike said .
" the artists loved to work outside , close to nature and inspired by it .
i like to think of them as the first hippies , long before those of the 1960s . " author : leah mcdonnell -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen the latest exhibition at the bruecke museum is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel , combining works from its own collection as well as those on loan from the united states , england and europe .

german daily sueddeutsche zeitung had reported that siemens said the 15 companies had discovered the virus and informed siemens of the incidents .
the paper said five of those clients had their head office in germany .
the incidents were reported a month ago , but siemens said that the virus is not causing problems anymore , according to the paper .
germany 's biggest utitlities rwe and e.on were not affected by the virus .
the company said they succeeded in isolating the virus at a test facility for further study .
" our analyses have not yielded any conclusions on the specific purpose or the maker of the virus , " siemens told the paper .
sophisticated virus the virus has so far infected computers in indonesia , india , the united states , australia , britain , malaysia and pakistan .
the biggest target , however , has been iran and some believe the virus was designed to attack iran 's nuclear facilities .
the malware spreads via infected usb thumb drive memory sticks , exploiting vulnerabilities in the microsoft windows operating system .
the super-virus attacks software programs that run on supervisory control and data acquisition , or scada , systems , a product developed by siemens and sold around the world , including to iran .
scada is used to manage water supplies , oil rigs , power plants and other industrial facilities .
once the worm infects a system , it quickly sets up communications with a remote server computer that can be used to steal proprietary information or take control of the scada system .

now on show is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel . the largest collection of works from the german expressionist group die bruecke -lrb- " the bridge " -rrb- is housed in a modest , one-story building on the outskirts of berlin . the bruecke collective was founded in dresden in 1905 by four university students , who abandoned their studies to devote themselves to art . the founders - ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz beyl , erich heckel , and karl schmidt-rotluff - were obsessed with the desire to create a new type of art that , in their words , was " immediate and pure . " " their goal was to revolutionize art , and they did revolutionize german art because they wanted to portray inner emotions and their subjective perceptions and that was something very new at the time , " art academic kathy stoike told deutsche welle . the way the artists depicted objects and people was very new , and not understood at the time , stoike pointed out . " you see a storm of colors , and you have to imagine that the people in 1905 did n't have any color photography , any movies , and the neon lights you have today , they did n't exist , " she said .
" it was all a bit darker , and black and white . " from the heart to the canvas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this painting , " roman stilllife , " by erich heckel was stolen from the bruecke musuem in 2002 bruecke artists strove to capture their inner perception on canvas - not what they saw , but what they felt . painted by schmitt-rottluff , a sailboat seascape becomes a kaleidoscope of swirling colors , which evoke the joy and magic of a summer day at sea .
a reclining nude by kirchner , painted with bold , impulsive strokes of bright red , the shadows of her curves in blue and green , is striking and sensual , comforting and warm . the artists rejected not only the established conventions and aesthetics of classical art , but also its techniques , devising their own painting methods as they went along . though in terms of creative expression their techniques were very effective , they were also impractical , bruecke museum director magdalena moeller explained . " the artists were self-taught , " she remarked .
" they studied architecture , not art , and did n't know how to prepare canvases or work with oil paint . " the artists simply applied the paint right from the tube to the canvas .
" this was a completely unorthodox way to work with oil paints , " she said .
" and this is also why their paintings are so fragile ; the paint is not stabile on the canvas , and why today these works must be transported with such care . " bruecke at its climax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " farn in the marsch " by emil nolde , one of the great 20th-century water color painters up until 1910 , the group had developed a distinct collective style , taking as their subjects the natural beauty of landscapes and the human form .
each artist had his own individual technique , yet their works as a whole from this period possess simplicity of depiction , vibrant use of color and exquisite compositional harmony .
this period is seen as the climax of the bruecke 's artistic achievements . the bruecke artists moved to berlin in 1911 , where big city life greatly influenced their work .
sharp angles , edgy , brittle brushwork and a subdued color palette became their defining stylistic elements .
they focused on street scenes and austere portraits . in 1913 , personal and professional differences caused the group to disband , but the artists continued to work separately , with each gaining individual recognition by the 1920s . " of course in the ' 30s with the national socialists , they were all defamed as ' degenerate ' artists , " stoike said .
" they were re-established after the second world war , but figurative art was no longer favored then since it had been exploited by the nazis for propaganda reasons . " the art of the bruecke , although expressionistic , proved too figurative for the times and fell out of fashion .
tastes for more abstract art were developing , with artists like wassily kandinsky grabbing attention on the world art stage . still , over time , the bruecke became synonymous with the german expressionist movement , and took its rightful place within the international avant-garde . renewed bruecke popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city life influenced their work , like kirchner 's " berlin street scene " these days , the bruecke is enjoying a new surge of international popularity , claims museum director moeller .
her museum has recently had an increase in requests for loans of up to 150 works from renowned art institutions around the world , such as moscow 's pushkin museum , london 's royal academy and new york 's museum of modern art , to name a few . even the french are acquiring a taste for early german expressionists , with the first bruecke exhibition ever to take place in france next year . moeller said it was the simplicity and straight-forwardness of bruecke art that made it so appealing today .
" it 's not abstract or complicated or burdened with problems the viewer has to interpret ; nor is bruecke art a conceptual art so that you need additional knowledge to understand , " she pointed out . viewers can just sit back , relax and take in the vibrant colors and clear , simple lines .
the unorthodox approach to art created back then was a stroke of fate , stoike explained . " it was a movement against the bourgeoisie society , " stoike said .
" the artists loved to work outside , close to nature and inspired by it .
i like to think of them as the first hippies , long before those of the 1960s . " author : leah mcdonnell -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen the latest exhibition at the bruecke museum is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel , combining works from its own collection as well as those on loan from the united states , england and europe .

the super-virus attacks software programs that run on supervisory control and data acquisition , or scada , systems , a product developed by siemens and sold around the world , including to iran .
scada is used to manage water supplies , oil rigs , power plants and other industrial facilities .
once the worm infects a system , it quickly sets up communications with a remote server computer that can be used to steal proprietary information or take control of the scada system .

politicians have been urging germans to celebrate the accomplishments achieved in the united country over the past two decades . on october 3 , 1990 germany was officially reunified after four decades of division into the soviet-controlled communist german democratic republic in the east and the federal republic of germany in the west .
the berlin wall had fallen just 11 months earlier when germans celebrated their reunited status in front of the bundestag , or parliament , in berlin .
october 3 has been a public holiday since , with the northern port city of bremen this year taking its turn as the lead city for the celebrations .
the city has been turned into a venue for concerts , street parties , parades and appearances by leading politicians .
" today , we remember the brave citizens who fought for freedom .
that 's why we 're celebrating today with a citizens ' festival , " bremen mayor and the current president of the upper house of the german parliament , jens boehrnsen said on saturday as he kicked off the festivities .

" for people from the former gdr -lrb- german democratic republic -rrb- almost everything has changed , " she said , noting the " wave of solidarity " from the former west germany .
" it 's thanks to these joint efforts that we 've been able to rebuild so quickly , " she added .
in an interview with daily bild am sonntag , merkel said she wished people in the west would appreciate more what people in the former east had achieved .
" it 's a shame that some people still do n't understand that the gdr regime was one thing , but the individual people and their achievements are another . "
speaking ahead of the anniversary , president wulff said : " 20 years of german unity is an occasion to celebrate , but also to pause for thought .

politicians have been urging germans to celebrate the accomplishments achieved in the united country over the past two decades . on october 3 , 1990 germany was officially reunified after four decades of division into the soviet-controlled communist german democratic republic in the east and the federal republic of germany in the west .
the berlin wall had fallen just 11 months earlier when germans celebrated their reunited status in front of the bundestag , or parliament , in berlin .
october 3 has been a public holiday since , with the northern port city of bremen this year taking its turn as the lead city for the celebrations .
the city has been turned into a venue for concerts , street parties , parades and appearances by leading politicians .
" today , we remember the brave citizens who fought for freedom .
that 's why we 're celebrating today with a citizens ' festival , " bremen mayor and the current president of the upper house of the german parliament , jens boehrnsen said on saturday as he kicked off the festivities .
in the market square , a version of the berlin wall has been erected to display images and texts showing the story of the country 's division and reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surrounded by students , bremen mayor boehrnsen kicked off celebrations among the high points of the celebrations set to take place over the weekend are a firework display on saturday evening along with a performance by 1980s german pop sensation nena .
protests mainly peaceful around 1,500 mainly left-wing demonstrators held protests in bremen on saturday , coinciding with celebrations for the 20th anniversary of german reunification . under the motto " october 3rd is not a day to celebrate " the demonstrators marched through bremen 's city-center .
fireworks and bottles were thrown but a police spokesman said fears of large-scale riots did not materialize . ahead of the weekend celebrations leftists groups and anarchists had threatened to launch attacks and civil unrest . merkel emphasizes solidarity chancellor angela merkel and german president christian wulff are due to give speeches on sunday , with a church service also planned .
all 16 of germany 's states and cities were being represented at the festival venue .
in her weekly video address , merkel urged germans to value the freedom and democracy reunification brought to eastern germany and not just complain about the costs .
" for people from the former gdr -lrb- german democratic republic -rrb- almost everything has changed , " she said , noting the " wave of solidarity " from the former west germany .
" it 's thanks to these joint efforts that we 've been able to rebuild so quickly , " she added .
in an interview with daily bild am sonntag , merkel said she wished people in the west would appreciate more what people in the former east had achieved .
" it 's a shame that some people still do n't understand that the gdr regime was one thing , but the individual people and their achievements are another . "
speaking ahead of the anniversary , president wulff said : " 20 years of german unity is an occasion to celebrate , but also to pause for thought .
the changes that have occurred in our country in this time are immense , particularly in the east . " famous landmark is a focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl presided over the process of german reunification in berlin , the brandenburg gate is the focal point for an entertainment program , with stage shows and attractions lined up along the avenue leading to the landmark .
as the country prepared for the occasion , there was a rare speech on friday from former chancellor helmut kohl , who is known in germany as " the reunification chancellor . "
kohl , aged 80 and now confined to a wheelchair , spoke of the significance of the occasion to a meeting of christian democratic party colleagues .
" these dates are an occasion to take pleasure in what we have achieved , to remember with gratitude and pride where we have come from and also to look forward together , " he said .

now on show is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel . the largest collection of works from the german expressionist group die bruecke -lrb- " the bridge " -rrb- is housed in a modest , one-story building on the outskirts of berlin . the bruecke collective was founded in dresden in 1905 by four university students , who abandoned their studies to devote themselves to art . the founders - ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz beyl , erich heckel , and karl schmidt-rotluff - were obsessed with the desire to create a new type of art that , in their words , was " immediate and pure . " " their goal was to revolutionize art , and they did revolutionize german art because they wanted to portray inner emotions and their subjective perceptions and that was something very new at the time , " art academic kathy stoike told deutsche welle . the way the artists depicted objects and people was very new , and not understood at the time , stoike pointed out . " you see a storm of colors , and you have to imagine that the people in 1905 did n't have any color photography , any movies , and the neon lights you have today , they did n't exist , " she said .
" it was all a bit darker , and black and white . " from the heart to the canvas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this painting , " roman stilllife , " by erich heckel was stolen from the bruecke musuem in 2002 bruecke artists strove to capture their inner perception on canvas - not what they saw , but what they felt . painted by schmitt-rottluff , a sailboat seascape becomes a kaleidoscope of swirling colors , which evoke the joy and magic of a summer day at sea .
a reclining nude by kirchner , painted with bold , impulsive strokes of bright red , the shadows of her curves in blue and green , is striking and sensual , comforting and warm . the artists rejected not only the established conventions and aesthetics of classical art , but also its techniques , devising their own painting methods as they went along . though in terms of creative expression their techniques were very effective , they were also impractical , bruecke museum director magdalena moeller explained . " the artists were self-taught , " she remarked .
" they studied architecture , not art , and did n't know how to prepare canvases or work with oil paint . " the artists simply applied the paint right from the tube to the canvas .
" this was a completely unorthodox way to work with oil paints , " she said .
" and this is also why their paintings are so fragile ; the paint is not stabile on the canvas , and why today these works must be transported with such care . " bruecke at its climax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " farn in the marsch " by emil nolde , one of the great 20th-century water color painters up until 1910 , the group had developed a distinct collective style , taking as their subjects the natural beauty of landscapes and the human form .
each artist had his own individual technique , yet their works as a whole from this period possess simplicity of depiction , vibrant use of color and exquisite compositional harmony .
this period is seen as the climax of the bruecke 's artistic achievements . the bruecke artists moved to berlin in 1911 , where big city life greatly influenced their work .
sharp angles , edgy , brittle brushwork and a subdued color palette became their defining stylistic elements .
they focused on street scenes and austere portraits . in 1913 , personal and professional differences caused the group to disband , but the artists continued to work separately , with each gaining individual recognition by the 1920s . " of course in the ' 30s with the national socialists , they were all defamed as ' degenerate ' artists , " stoike said .
" they were re-established after the second world war , but figurative art was no longer favored then since it had been exploited by the nazis for propaganda reasons . " the art of the bruecke , although expressionistic , proved too figurative for the times and fell out of fashion .
tastes for more abstract art were developing , with artists like wassily kandinsky grabbing attention on the world art stage . still , over time , the bruecke became synonymous with the german expressionist movement , and took its rightful place within the international avant-garde . renewed bruecke popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city life influenced their work , like kirchner 's " berlin street scene " these days , the bruecke is enjoying a new surge of international popularity , claims museum director moeller .
her museum has recently had an increase in requests for loans of up to 150 works from renowned art institutions around the world , such as moscow 's pushkin museum , london 's royal academy and new york 's museum of modern art , to name a few . even the french are acquiring a taste for early german expressionists , with the first bruecke exhibition ever to take place in france next year . moeller said it was the simplicity and straight-forwardness of bruecke art that made it so appealing today .
" it 's not abstract or complicated or burdened with problems the viewer has to interpret ; nor is bruecke art a conceptual art so that you need additional knowledge to understand , " she pointed out . viewers can just sit back , relax and take in the vibrant colors and clear , simple lines .
the unorthodox approach to art created back then was a stroke of fate , stoike explained . " it was a movement against the bourgeoisie society , " stoike said .
" the artists loved to work outside , close to nature and inspired by it .
i like to think of them as the first hippies , long before those of the 1960s . " author : leah mcdonnell -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen the latest exhibition at the bruecke museum is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel , combining works from its own collection as well as those on loan from the united states , england and europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 02.10.2010 the ' bruecke ' artists revolutionized german art with vibrant colors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " two girls by the water " by erich heckel the bruecke museum is a treasure trove of german expressionist art , with the movement 's artists having helped redefine the craft in the early 20th century .
now on show is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel . the largest collection of works from the german expressionist group die bruecke -lrb- " the bridge " -rrb- is housed in a modest , one-story building on the outskirts of berlin . the bruecke collective was founded in dresden in 1905 by four university students , who abandoned their studies to devote themselves to art . the founders - ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz beyl , erich heckel , and karl schmidt-rotluff - were obsessed with the desire to create a new type of art that , in their words , was " immediate and pure . " " their goal was to revolutionize art , and they did revolutionize german art because they wanted to portray inner emotions and their subjective perceptions and that was something very new at the time , " art academic kathy stoike told deutsche welle . the way the artists depicted objects and people was very new , and not understood at the time , stoike pointed out . " you see a storm of colors , and you have to imagine that the people in 1905 did n't have any color photography , any movies , and the neon lights you have today , they did n't exist , " she said .
" it was all a bit darker , and black and white . " from the heart to the canvas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this painting , " roman stilllife , " by erich heckel was stolen from the bruecke musuem in 2002 bruecke artists strove to capture their inner perception on canvas - not what they saw , but what they felt . painted by schmitt-rottluff , a sailboat seascape becomes a kaleidoscope of swirling colors , which evoke the joy and magic of a summer day at sea .
a reclining nude by kirchner , painted with bold , impulsive strokes of bright red , the shadows of her curves in blue and green , is striking and sensual , comforting and warm . the artists rejected not only the established conventions and aesthetics of classical art , but also its techniques , devising their own painting methods as they went along . though in terms of creative expression their techniques were very effective , they were also impractical , bruecke museum director magdalena moeller explained . " the artists were self-taught , " she remarked .
" they studied architecture , not art , and did n't know how to prepare canvases or work with oil paint . " the artists simply applied the paint right from the tube to the canvas .
" this was a completely unorthodox way to work with oil paints , " she said .
" and this is also why their paintings are so fragile ; the paint is not stabile on the canvas , and why today these works must be transported with such care . " bruecke at its climax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " farn in the marsch " by emil nolde , one of the great 20th-century water color painters up until 1910 , the group had developed a distinct collective style , taking as their subjects the natural beauty of landscapes and the human form .
each artist had his own individual technique , yet their works as a whole from this period possess simplicity of depiction , vibrant use of color and exquisite compositional harmony .
this period is seen as the climax of the bruecke 's artistic achievements . the bruecke artists moved to berlin in 1911 , where big city life greatly influenced their work .
sharp angles , edgy , brittle brushwork and a subdued color palette became their defining stylistic elements .
they focused on street scenes and austere portraits . in 1913 , personal and professional differences caused the group to disband , but the artists continued to work separately , with each gaining individual recognition by the 1920s . " of course in the ' 30s with the national socialists , they were all defamed as ' degenerate ' artists , " stoike said .
" they were re-established after the second world war , but figurative art was no longer favored then since it had been exploited by the nazis for propaganda reasons . " the art of the bruecke , although expressionistic , proved too figurative for the times and fell out of fashion .
tastes for more abstract art were developing , with artists like wassily kandinsky grabbing attention on the world art stage . still , over time , the bruecke became synonymous with the german expressionist movement , and took its rightful place within the international avant-garde . renewed bruecke popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city life influenced their work , like kirchner 's " berlin street scene " these days , the bruecke is enjoying a new surge of international popularity , claims museum director moeller .
her museum has recently had an increase in requests for loans of up to 150 works from renowned art institutions around the world , such as moscow 's pushkin museum , london 's royal academy and new york 's museum of modern art , to name a few . even the french are acquiring a taste for early german expressionists , with the first bruecke exhibition ever to take place in france next year . moeller said it was the simplicity and straight-forwardness of bruecke art that made it so appealing today .
" it 's not abstract or complicated or burdened with problems the viewer has to interpret ; nor is bruecke art a conceptual art so that you need additional knowledge to understand , " she pointed out . viewers can just sit back , relax and take in the vibrant colors and clear , simple lines .
the unorthodox approach to art created back then was a stroke of fate , stoike explained . " it was a movement against the bourgeoisie society , " stoike said .

now on show is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel . the largest collection of works from the german expressionist group die bruecke -lrb- " the bridge " -rrb- is housed in a modest , one-story building on the outskirts of berlin . the bruecke collective was founded in dresden in 1905 by four university students , who abandoned their studies to devote themselves to art . the founders - ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz beyl , erich heckel , and karl schmidt-rotluff - were obsessed with the desire to create a new type of art that , in their words , was " immediate and pure . " " their goal was to revolutionize art , and they did revolutionize german art because they wanted to portray inner emotions and their subjective perceptions and that was something very new at the time , " art academic kathy stoike told deutsche welle . the way the artists depicted objects and people was very new , and not understood at the time , stoike pointed out . " you see a storm of colors , and you have to imagine that the people in 1905 did n't have any color photography , any movies , and the neon lights you have today , they did n't exist , " she said .

meanwhile , the dutch christian democrats have ratified a deal to form a government with the support of wilders ' party . populist dutch politician geert wilders , known for his strident anti-islam and anti-immigration views , held a speech in a berlin hotel on saturday amid protests outside the venue .
" germany too needs a political movement that defends the national identity of the country . germany 's political identity , its economic success , is threatened by islam , " wilders told an audience of some 500 people at a hotel in berlin 's tiergarten district .
" islam is a dangerous political ideology for everyone , " wilders , who is facing prosecution in the netherlands for incitement to hatred , said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing activists in berlin protested against wilders ' visit the event sparked protests in front of the hotel .
police said some more than 100 demonstrators holding up banners reading " berlin against nazis - it 's our right to stop them " and " send geert wilders home " rallied in front of the hotel . wilders claims islam is a totalitarian religion and advocates banning the koran , the burqa and the construction of mosques .
wilders ' party gets boost on saturday , delegates at a congress of the dutch christian democratic appeal -lrb- cda -rrb- in the netherlands voted overwhelmingly in favour of entering a center-right governing coalition which would rely on the support of wilders ' freedom party -lrb- pvv -rrb- .
june 's general election delivered a surge of support for the freedom party , which won the third biggest share of the seats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal paves the way for a dutch minority government supported by wilders ' party earlier this week , the liberal vvd and wilders ' pvv approved the deal which makes concessions to wilders such as allowing the netherlands to ban the full islamic veil .
the liberals -lrb- vvd -rrb- and cda , which hold 52 seats in the 150-member parliament , would rely on wilders ' 24 freedom party -lrb- pvv -rrb- mps to get legislation passed .
saturday 's vote was preceded by heated debate and objections by some members of the cda opposed to cooperating with wilders ' party .
merkel distances herself from wilders ' visit german lawmaker rene stadtkewitz formed his freedom party amid a heated national debate over integration , particularly in relation to muslims . a controversial book by former german central bank board member thilo sarrazin claiming that muslims were undermining german society thrust the subject into the spotlight last month .
the german government has distanced itself from wilders and the invitation by stadtkewitz to invite him to berlin .
" it is not our style to utterly condemn any religion , " german chancellor angela merkel said through her spokesman steffen seibert in berlin .
merkel had previously told the committee on european affairs of the bundestag parliament that she regretted the formation of a minority dutch coalition government which depends on wilders ' party to win key votes .
the event comes as fears mounts among german mainstream political parties of the emergence of a new anti-immigration , anti-islam right wing movement . author : richard connor -lrb- ap / afp / reuters / dpa -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 02.10.2010 the ' bruecke ' artists revolutionized german art with vibrant colors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " two girls by the water " by erich heckel the bruecke museum is a treasure trove of german expressionist art , with the movement 's artists having helped redefine the craft in the early 20th century .
now on show is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel . the largest collection of works from the german expressionist group die bruecke -lrb- " the bridge " -rrb- is housed in a modest , one-story building on the outskirts of berlin . the bruecke collective was founded in dresden in 1905 by four university students , who abandoned their studies to devote themselves to art . the founders - ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz beyl , erich heckel , and karl schmidt-rotluff - were obsessed with the desire to create a new type of art that , in their words , was " immediate and pure . " " their goal was to revolutionize art , and they did revolutionize german art because they wanted to portray inner emotions and their subjective perceptions and that was something very new at the time , " art academic kathy stoike told deutsche welle . the way the artists depicted objects and people was very new , and not understood at the time , stoike pointed out . " you see a storm of colors , and you have to imagine that the people in 1905 did n't have any color photography , any movies , and the neon lights you have today , they did n't exist , " she said .
" it was all a bit darker , and black and white . " from the heart to the canvas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this painting , " roman stilllife , " by erich heckel was stolen from the bruecke musuem in 2002 bruecke artists strove to capture their inner perception on canvas - not what they saw , but what they felt . painted by schmitt-rottluff , a sailboat seascape becomes a kaleidoscope of swirling colors , which evoke the joy and magic of a summer day at sea .
a reclining nude by kirchner , painted with bold , impulsive strokes of bright red , the shadows of her curves in blue and green , is striking and sensual , comforting and warm . the artists rejected not only the established conventions and aesthetics of classical art , but also its techniques , devising their own painting methods as they went along . though in terms of creative expression their techniques were very effective , they were also impractical , bruecke museum director magdalena moeller explained . " the artists were self-taught , " she remarked .
" they studied architecture , not art , and did n't know how to prepare canvases or work with oil paint . " the artists simply applied the paint right from the tube to the canvas .
" this was a completely unorthodox way to work with oil paints , " she said .
" and this is also why their paintings are so fragile ; the paint is not stabile on the canvas , and why today these works must be transported with such care . " bruecke at its climax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " farn in the marsch " by emil nolde , one of the great 20th-century water color painters up until 1910 , the group had developed a distinct collective style , taking as their subjects the natural beauty of landscapes and the human form .
each artist had his own individual technique , yet their works as a whole from this period possess simplicity of depiction , vibrant use of color and exquisite compositional harmony .
this period is seen as the climax of the bruecke 's artistic achievements . the bruecke artists moved to berlin in 1911 , where big city life greatly influenced their work .
sharp angles , edgy , brittle brushwork and a subdued color palette became their defining stylistic elements .
they focused on street scenes and austere portraits . in 1913 , personal and professional differences caused the group to disband , but the artists continued to work separately , with each gaining individual recognition by the 1920s . " of course in the ' 30s with the national socialists , they were all defamed as ' degenerate ' artists , " stoike said .
" they were re-established after the second world war , but figurative art was no longer favored then since it had been exploited by the nazis for propaganda reasons . " the art of the bruecke , although expressionistic , proved too figurative for the times and fell out of fashion .
tastes for more abstract art were developing , with artists like wassily kandinsky grabbing attention on the world art stage . still , over time , the bruecke became synonymous with the german expressionist movement , and took its rightful place within the international avant-garde . renewed bruecke popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city life influenced their work , like kirchner 's " berlin street scene " these days , the bruecke is enjoying a new surge of international popularity , claims museum director moeller .
her museum has recently had an increase in requests for loans of up to 150 works from renowned art institutions around the world , such as moscow 's pushkin museum , london 's royal academy and new york 's museum of modern art , to name a few . even the french are acquiring a taste for early german expressionists , with the first bruecke exhibition ever to take place in france next year . moeller said it was the simplicity and straight-forwardness of bruecke art that made it so appealing today .
" it 's not abstract or complicated or burdened with problems the viewer has to interpret ; nor is bruecke art a conceptual art so that you need additional knowledge to understand , " she pointed out . viewers can just sit back , relax and take in the vibrant colors and clear , simple lines .
the unorthodox approach to art created back then was a stroke of fate , stoike explained . " it was a movement against the bourgeoisie society , " stoike said .
" the artists loved to work outside , close to nature and inspired by it .
i like to think of them as the first hippies , long before those of the 1960s . " author : leah mcdonnell -lrb- als -rrb- editor : kate bowen the latest exhibition at the bruecke museum is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel , combining works from its own collection as well as those on loan from the united states , england and europe .

german daily sueddeutsche zeitung had reported that siemens said the 15 companies had discovered the virus and informed siemens of the incidents .
the paper said five of those clients had their head office in germany .
the incidents were reported a month ago , but siemens said that the virus is not causing problems anymore , according to the paper .
germany 's biggest utitlities rwe and e.on were not affected by the virus .
the company said they succeeded in isolating the virus at a test facility for further study .
" our analyses have not yielded any conclusions on the specific purpose or the maker of the virus , " siemens told the paper .
sophisticated virus the virus has so far infected computers in indonesia , india , the united states , australia , britain , malaysia and pakistan .
the biggest target , however , has been iran and some believe the virus was designed to attack iran 's nuclear facilities .
the malware spreads via infected usb thumb drive memory sticks , exploiting vulnerabilities in the microsoft windows operating system .
the super-virus attacks software programs that run on supervisory control and data acquisition , or scada , systems , a product developed by siemens and sold around the world , including to iran .
scada is used to manage water supplies , oil rigs , power plants and other industrial facilities .
once the worm infects a system , it quickly sets up communications with a remote server computer that can be used to steal proprietary information or take control of the scada system .

the berlin wall had fallen just 11 months earlier when germans celebrated their reunited status in front of the bundestag , or parliament , in berlin .
october 3 has been a public holiday since , with the northern port city of bremen this year taking its turn as the lead city for the celebrations .
the city has been turned into a venue for concerts , street parties , parades and appearances by leading politicians .
" today , we remember the brave citizens who fought for freedom .
that 's why we 're celebrating today with a citizens ' festival , " bremen mayor and the current president of the upper house of the german parliament , jens boehrnsen said on saturday as he kicked off the festivities .

in an interview with daily bild am sonntag , merkel said she wished people in the west would appreciate more what people in the former east had achieved .
" it 's a shame that some people still do n't understand that the gdr regime was one thing , but the individual people and their achievements are another . "
speaking ahead of the anniversary , president wulff said : " 20 years of german unity is an occasion to celebrate , but also to pause for thought .

" these dates are an occasion to take pleasure in what we have achieved , to remember with gratitude and pride where we have come from and also to look forward together , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 02.10.2010 gay rights movement in germany follows path of reunification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay legal rights vary little from east to west twenty years after reunification , there is close cooperation between gay activists in eastern and western germany .
but important differences in gay life still remain . as germany celebrates the 20th anniversary of reunification , the former east-west divide in the country 's gay and lesbian rights movement has all but disappeared .
there is currently close cooperation between gay and lesbian activists in the eastern and western states , according to eduard stapel , founder of several gay rights groups in former east germany .
unlike the united states , where gay rights vary widely from state to state , the legal rights of gays and lesbians are virtually the same in the east and west .
" that 's apart from the fact that we 've made slightly more progress in eastern germany , with discrimination bans in the berlin , brandenburg and thuringia state constitutions , " stapel told deutsche welle .
" but that has little effect on everyday life . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays in berlin enjoy one of the most accepting environments social acceptance of homosexuality is also roughly the same in eastern and western states , according to a 2001 study by the opinion research group tns emnid .
the study found that nearly the same percentage of people in the east as in the west say homosexuality is no longer objectionable .
the highest percentage of acceptance was in berlin , while the lowest was in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
gay life in former east germany while there is very little documentation of gay life in former east germany , a unique exception is the 1989 film " coming out . "
it follows a young teacher in east berlin struggling to accept his gay identity , and was the first and only gay-themed film produced in east germany .
it also won the second-place silver bear prize in the 1990 berlin film festival .
the film 's premiere was coincidentally held on november 9 , 1989 , the same night east german authorities opened the border to the west and people from across germany began to tear down the berlin wall .
matthias freihof , who played the protagonist phillip , said when he was first offered the leading role in the film , he knew it would be a major boost to his career .
the director , heiner carow , was one of the most well-known and respected directors in all of east germany .
what freihof did not anticipate was the long-lasting effect " coming out " would have on gay cinema .
bildunterschrift : " coming out " won the silver bear award at the 1990 berlin film festival " i 'm on the way to different festivals almost every year , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is very astonishing for me , that this film still has the power to entertain people , to pull them into the story . "
" coming out " was made at a time of huge political upheaval in all of eastern europe , just as the east german gay and lesbian community was becoming more visible .

but important differences in gay life still remain . as germany celebrates the 20th anniversary of reunification , the former east-west divide in the country 's gay and lesbian rights movement has all but disappeared .
there is currently close cooperation between gay and lesbian activists in the eastern and western states , according to eduard stapel , founder of several gay rights groups in former east germany .
unlike the united states , where gay rights vary widely from state to state , the legal rights of gays and lesbians are virtually the same in the east and west .
" that 's apart from the fact that we 've made slightly more progress in eastern germany , with discrimination bans in the berlin , brandenburg and thuringia state constitutions , " stapel told deutsche welle .
" but that has little effect on everyday life . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays in berlin enjoy one of the most accepting environments social acceptance of homosexuality is also roughly the same in eastern and western states , according to a 2001 study by the opinion research group tns emnid .
the study found that nearly the same percentage of people in the east as in the west say homosexuality is no longer objectionable .
the highest percentage of acceptance was in berlin , while the lowest was in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
gay life in former east germany while there is very little documentation of gay life in former east germany , a unique exception is the 1989 film " coming out . "
it follows a young teacher in east berlin struggling to accept his gay identity , and was the first and only gay-themed film produced in east germany .
it also won the second-place silver bear prize in the 1990 berlin film festival .
the film 's premiere was coincidentally held on november 9 , 1989 , the same night east german authorities opened the border to the west and people from across germany began to tear down the berlin wall .
matthias freihof , who played the protagonist phillip , said when he was first offered the leading role in the film , he knew it would be a major boost to his career .
the director , heiner carow , was one of the most well-known and respected directors in all of east germany .
what freihof did not anticipate was the long-lasting effect " coming out " would have on gay cinema .
bildunterschrift : " coming out " won the silver bear award at the 1990 berlin film festival " i 'm on the way to different festivals almost every year , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is very astonishing for me , that this film still has the power to entertain people , to pull them into the story . "
" coming out " was made at a time of huge political upheaval in all of eastern europe , just as the east german gay and lesbian community was becoming more visible .
the first gay-themed theater production , a growing number of books and resources on homosexuality all marked the beginnings of an organized gay rights movement .

but important differences in gay life still remain . as germany celebrates the 20th anniversary of reunification , the former east-west divide in the country 's gay and lesbian rights movement has all but disappeared .
there is currently close cooperation between gay and lesbian activists in the eastern and western states , according to eduard stapel , founder of several gay rights groups in former east germany .
unlike the united states , where gay rights vary widely from state to state , the legal rights of gays and lesbians are virtually the same in the east and west .
" that 's apart from the fact that we 've made slightly more progress in eastern germany , with discrimination bans in the berlin , brandenburg and thuringia state constitutions , " stapel told deutsche welle .
" but that has little effect on everyday life . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays in berlin enjoy one of the most accepting environments social acceptance of homosexuality is also roughly the same in eastern and western states , according to a 2001 study by the opinion research group tns emnid .
the study found that nearly the same percentage of people in the east as in the west say homosexuality is no longer objectionable .
the highest percentage of acceptance was in berlin , while the lowest was in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
gay life in former east germany while there is very little documentation of gay life in former east germany , a unique exception is the 1989 film " coming out . "
it follows a young teacher in east berlin struggling to accept his gay identity , and was the first and only gay-themed film produced in east germany .
it also won the second-place silver bear prize in the 1990 berlin film festival .
the film 's premiere was coincidentally held on november 9 , 1989 , the same night east german authorities opened the border to the west and people from across germany began to tear down the berlin wall .
matthias freihof , who played the protagonist phillip , said when he was first offered the leading role in the film , he knew it would be a major boost to his career .
the director , heiner carow , was one of the most well-known and respected directors in all of east germany .
what freihof did not anticipate was the long-lasting effect " coming out " would have on gay cinema .
bildunterschrift : " coming out " won the silver bear award at the 1990 berlin film festival " i 'm on the way to different festivals almost every year , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is very astonishing for me , that this film still has the power to entertain people , to pull them into the story . "
" coming out " was made at a time of huge political upheaval in all of eastern europe , just as the east german gay and lesbian community was becoming more visible .
the first gay-themed theater production , a growing number of books and resources on homosexuality all marked the beginnings of an organized gay rights movement .
" there was a kind of liberation coming up in the early 80s , so the step to do a film about this subject was clear , " freihof said .
" but the officials did n't like the idea , of course , because they knew about the subject , but they did n't want to make a big thing out of it . "
reunification depoliticizes the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stapel founded many east german gay organizations under a repressive government , political activism actually flourished in east germany , stapel said .
gays rights activists , alongside feminists , human rights activists and environmentalists , formed a strong and unified civil rights movement that opposed the east german authoritarian state .
political activism there filled the void left by the absence of a real social scene , like bars , restaurants and movie theaters , stapel said .
but after the fall of the berlin wall and the emergence of capitalism in east germany , the gay community became less political and less organized .
" people in communist east germany would go wherever things were happening , and that was the case with political groups , " stapel said .
" but when all of a sudden there is a social scene , then there 's no more reason to go to political groups . "
film shows far-right extremism an important exception to the depoliticization in eastern germany is the rise of right-wing extremism .
neo-nazi groups have grown in the east since reunification , which freihof said was easily foreseen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazism has been a growing problem in the east " our film was the first film that showed the neo-nazis in east berlin , because that was something nobody was talking about from official side , " he said .
" so after the wall came down , this problem became bigger and bigger , and for us it was not surprising . "
in one scene of " coming out , " freihof 's character phillip witnesses a group of neo-nazis attacking a young man they believe is gay in a subway station .
such attacks were not uncommon , freihof said , as far-right groups became more active and increasingly targeted the gay community .
" it happened sometimes that neo-nazi groups went to gay places to fight with the people , " freihof said .
but the rise of right-wing extremism in the east since reunification and its influence on violence against gays should not be overstated , according to stapel .
one of the more pressing concerns there is discrimination in the workplace .
" many people in the east are much more afraid now than during communism of losing their jobs because of their sexuality , " he said .

politicians have been urging germans to celebrate the accomplishments achieved in the united country over the past two decades . on october 3 , 1990 germany was officially reunified after four decades of division into the soviet-controlled communist german democratic republic in the east and the federal republic of germany in the west .
the berlin wall had fallen just 11 months earlier when germans celebrated their reunited status in front of the bundestag , or parliament , in berlin .
october 3 has been a public holiday since , with the northern port city of bremen this year taking its turn as the lead city for the celebrations .
the city has been turned into a venue for concerts , street parties , parades and appearances by leading politicians .
" today , we remember the brave citizens who fought for freedom .
that 's why we 're celebrating today with a citizens ' festival , " bremen mayor and the current president of the upper house of the german parliament , jens boehrnsen said on saturday as he kicked off the festivities .
in the market square , a version of the berlin wall has been erected to display images and texts showing the story of the country 's division and reunification .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : surrounded by students , bremen mayor boehrnsen kicked off celebrations among the high points of the celebrations set to take place over the weekend are a firework display on saturday evening along with a performance by 1980s german pop sensation nena .
protests mainly peaceful around 1,500 mainly left-wing demonstrators held protests in bremen on saturday , coinciding with celebrations for the 20th anniversary of german reunification . under the motto " october 3rd is not a day to celebrate " the demonstrators marched through bremen 's city-center .
fireworks and bottles were thrown but a police spokesman said fears of large-scale riots did not materialize . ahead of the weekend celebrations leftists groups and anarchists had threatened to launch attacks and civil unrest . merkel emphasizes solidarity chancellor angela merkel and german president christian wulff are due to give speeches on sunday , with a church service also planned .
all 16 of germany 's states and cities were being represented at the festival venue .
in her weekly video address , merkel urged germans to value the freedom and democracy reunification brought to eastern germany and not just complain about the costs .
" for people from the former gdr -lrb- german democratic republic -rrb- almost everything has changed , " she said , noting the " wave of solidarity " from the former west germany .
" it 's thanks to these joint efforts that we 've been able to rebuild so quickly , " she added .
in an interview with daily bild am sonntag , merkel said she wished people in the west would appreciate more what people in the former east had achieved .
" it 's a shame that some people still do n't understand that the gdr regime was one thing , but the individual people and their achievements are another . "
speaking ahead of the anniversary , president wulff said : " 20 years of german unity is an occasion to celebrate , but also to pause for thought .
the changes that have occurred in our country in this time are immense , particularly in the east . " famous landmark is a focus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl presided over the process of german reunification in berlin , the brandenburg gate is the focal point for an entertainment program , with stage shows and attractions lined up along the avenue leading to the landmark .

kohl , aged 80 and now confined to a wheelchair , spoke of the significance of the occasion to a meeting of christian democratic party colleagues .
" these dates are an occasion to take pleasure in what we have achieved , to remember with gratitude and pride where we have come from and also to look forward together , " he said .

there is currently close cooperation between gay and lesbian activists in the eastern and western states , according to eduard stapel , founder of several gay rights groups in former east germany .
unlike the united states , where gay rights vary widely from state to state , the legal rights of gays and lesbians are virtually the same in the east and west .

deutsche welle 's marc koch stresses how far reunified germany has come in such a short time - despite errors and challenges along the way . as reunified germany turns 20 , statistics dominate the headlines : dates and figures describing the state of the german nation today .
and rightly so : many of these figures reveal that errors were also made in the last two decades .
they show that unemployment is twice as high in eastern germany as it is in the west and that people in western germany are paid better than their eastern counterparts .
while there 's no lack of clever studies about these topics , what do they really say about germany and german reunification ? not much .
the greatest project of german post-war history is not yet over , and it is not to be measured in figures .
of course , citizens of the former west germany feel the financial burden of rebuilding the east to the tune of the several billion euros of taxes that have been and will continue to be invested into the former east germany .
greater yet was the challenge for many citizens of the former german democratic republic who had to begin a new life after their country 's social , political and economic collapse . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's editor-in-chief marc koch and yet the achievements of reunification have not been fully recognized by the german public .
instead , complaint seems to reign - although these complaints are little more than pure pressure-group politics , on both sides of the country .
no one could have expected that two very different societies like east and west germany would become one in just 20 years .
anyone who says there should be no noticeable difference between the two just two decades after reunification has not grasped the magnitude of this unprecedented and historically unique event .
and that is not changed by the fact that , between the fall of the berlin wall and october 3 , 1990 , many mistakes were made and many situations misjudged .
today one thing is clear : the architects of german unity had no time for experiments , no time for a slow rapprochement between the two german states .
they had to act quickly , taking advantage of a historically unique moment in which the world as they had always known it was undergoing radical changes .
and that 's what they did .
of course , it was rash to tell the german people that reunification could happen within a few years and at a negligible cost , as then-chancellor helmut kohl did .
even today those words still serve as cheap ammunition often fired in the course of pub conversations .
but they can not diminish the achievements of kohl and all those who worked to make german unity a reality .
that 's because germany has profited by its reunification in every regard .
in the last 20 years , this country has opened up , become more colorful , more lively and more laid-back .
it has learned how to deal with contradictions , unanswered questions , and social conflicts - how to accept them rather than sweep them under the rug .
today , germany is no longer fishing in muddy waters for answers .
instead , it is now a country of open eyes and inquisitive minds .
germany is a laboratory , a society at the heart of europe that is constantly confronting changes , challenges and new experiences .
that , too , is a result of reunification , and it says more about this country than any statistic .

meanwhile , the dutch christian democrats have ratified a deal to form a government with the support of wilders ' party . populist dutch politician geert wilders , known for his strident anti-islam and anti-immigration views , held a speech in a berlin hotel on saturday amid protests outside the venue .
" germany too needs a political movement that defends the national identity of the country . germany 's political identity , its economic success , is threatened by islam , " wilders told an audience of some 500 people at a hotel in berlin 's tiergarten district .
" islam is a dangerous political ideology for everyone , " wilders , who is facing prosecution in the netherlands for incitement to hatred , said .
visit triggers protests the 47-year-old was invited to berlin by a party founded in september by rene stadtkewitz , a former member of angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- who is also a critic of islam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : left-wing activists in berlin protested against wilders ' visit the event sparked protests in front of the hotel .
police said some more than 100 demonstrators holding up banners reading " berlin against nazis - it 's our right to stop them " and " send geert wilders home " rallied in front of the hotel . wilders claims islam is a totalitarian religion and advocates banning the koran , the burqa and the construction of mosques .
wilders ' party gets boost on saturday , delegates at a congress of the dutch christian democratic appeal -lrb- cda -rrb- in the netherlands voted overwhelmingly in favour of entering a center-right governing coalition which would rely on the support of wilders ' freedom party -lrb- pvv -rrb- .
june 's general election delivered a surge of support for the freedom party , which won the third biggest share of the seats .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deal paves the way for a dutch minority government supported by wilders ' party earlier this week , the liberal vvd and wilders ' pvv approved the deal which makes concessions to wilders such as allowing the netherlands to ban the full islamic veil .
the liberals -lrb- vvd -rrb- and cda , which hold 52 seats in the 150-member parliament , would rely on wilders ' 24 freedom party -lrb- pvv -rrb- mps to get legislation passed .
saturday 's vote was preceded by heated debate and objections by some members of the cda opposed to cooperating with wilders ' party .
merkel distances herself from wilders ' visit german lawmaker rene stadtkewitz formed his freedom party amid a heated national debate over integration , particularly in relation to muslims . a controversial book by former german central bank board member thilo sarrazin claiming that muslims were undermining german society thrust the subject into the spotlight last month .
the german government has distanced itself from wilders and the invitation by stadtkewitz to invite him to berlin .
" it is not our style to utterly condemn any religion , " german chancellor angela merkel said through her spokesman steffen seibert in berlin .
merkel had previously told the committee on european affairs of the bundestag parliament that she regretted the formation of a minority dutch coalition government which depends on wilders ' party to win key votes .
the event comes as fears mounts among german mainstream political parties of the emergence of a new anti-immigration , anti-islam right wing movement . author : richard connor -lrb- ap / afp / reuters / dpa -rrb- editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

politicians have been urging germans to celebrate the accomplishments achieved in the united country over the past two decades . on october 3 , 1990 germany was officially reunified after four decades of division into the soviet-controlled communist german democratic republic in the east and the federal republic of germany in the west .
the berlin wall had fallen just 11 months earlier when germans celebrated their reunited status in front of the bundestag , or parliament , in berlin .
october 3 has been a public holiday since , with the northern port city of bremen this year taking its turn as the lead city for the celebrations .
the city has been turned into a venue for concerts , street parties , parades and appearances by leading politicians .
" today , we remember the brave citizens who fought for freedom .
that 's why we 're celebrating today with a citizens ' festival , " bremen mayor and the current president of the upper house of the german parliament , jens boehrnsen said on saturday as he kicked off the festivities .

all 16 of germany 's states and cities were being represented at the festival venue .
in her weekly video address , merkel urged germans to value the freedom and democracy reunification brought to eastern germany and not just complain about the costs .
" for people from the former gdr -lrb- german democratic republic -rrb- almost everything has changed , " she said , noting the " wave of solidarity " from the former west germany .
" it 's thanks to these joint efforts that we 've been able to rebuild so quickly , " she added .
in an interview with daily bild am sonntag , merkel said she wished people in the west would appreciate more what people in the former east had achieved .
" it 's a shame that some people still do n't understand that the gdr regime was one thing , but the individual people and their achievements are another . "
speaking ahead of the anniversary , president wulff said : " 20 years of german unity is an occasion to celebrate , but also to pause for thought .
the changes that have occurred in our country in this time are immense , particularly in the east .

kohl , aged 80 and now confined to a wheelchair , spoke of the significance of the occasion to a meeting of christian democratic party colleagues .
" these dates are an occasion to take pleasure in what we have achieved , to remember with gratitude and pride where we have come from and also to look forward together , " he said .

october 3 has been a public holiday since , with the northern port city of bremen this year taking its turn as the lead city for the celebrations .
the city has been turned into a venue for concerts , street parties , parades and appearances by leading politicians .
" today , we remember the brave citizens who fought for freedom .
that 's why we 're celebrating today with a citizens ' festival , " bremen mayor and the current president of the upper house of the german parliament , jens boehrnsen said on saturday as he kicked off the festivities .

in an interview with daily bild am sonntag , merkel said she wished people in the west would appreciate more what people in the former east had achieved .
" it 's a shame that some people still do n't understand that the gdr regime was one thing , but the individual people and their achievements are another . "
speaking ahead of the anniversary , president wulff said : " 20 years of german unity is an occasion to celebrate , but also to pause for thought .

" these dates are an occasion to take pleasure in what we have achieved , to remember with gratitude and pride where we have come from and also to look forward together , " he said .

german daily sueddeutsche zeitung had reported that siemens said the 15 companies had discovered the virus and informed siemens of the incidents .
the paper said five of those clients had their head office in germany .
the incidents were reported a month ago , but siemens said that the virus is not causing problems anymore , according to the paper .
germany 's biggest utitlities rwe and e.on were not affected by the virus .
the company said they succeeded in isolating the virus at a test facility for further study .
" our analyses have not yielded any conclusions on the specific purpose or the maker of the virus , " siemens told the paper .
sophisticated virus the virus has so far infected computers in indonesia , india , the united states , australia , britain , malaysia and pakistan .
the biggest target , however , has been iran and some believe the virus was designed to attack iran 's nuclear facilities .
the malware spreads via infected usb thumb drive memory sticks , exploiting vulnerabilities in the microsoft windows operating system .
the super-virus attacks software programs that run on supervisory control and data acquisition , or scada , systems , a product developed by siemens and sold around the world , including to iran .
scada is used to manage water supplies , oil rigs , power plants and other industrial facilities .
once the worm infects a system , it quickly sets up communications with a remote server computer that can be used to steal proprietary information or take control of the scada system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 02.10.2010 the ' bruecke ' artists revolutionized german art with vibrant colors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " two girls by the water " by erich heckel the bruecke museum is a treasure trove of german expressionist art , with the movement 's artists having helped redefine the craft in the early 20th century .
now on show is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel . the largest collection of works from the german expressionist group die bruecke -lrb- " the bridge " -rrb- is housed in a modest , one-story building on the outskirts of berlin . the bruecke collective was founded in dresden in 1905 by four university students , who abandoned their studies to devote themselves to art . the founders - ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz beyl , erich heckel , and karl schmidt-rotluff - were obsessed with the desire to create a new type of art that , in their words , was " immediate and pure . " " their goal was to revolutionize art , and they did revolutionize german art because they wanted to portray inner emotions and their subjective perceptions and that was something very new at the time , " art academic kathy stoike told deutsche welle . the way the artists depicted objects and people was very new , and not understood at the time , stoike pointed out . " you see a storm of colors , and you have to imagine that the people in 1905 did n't have any color photography , any movies , and the neon lights you have today , they did n't exist , " she said .
" it was all a bit darker , and black and white . " from the heart to the canvas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this painting , " roman stilllife , " by erich heckel was stolen from the bruecke musuem in 2002 bruecke artists strove to capture their inner perception on canvas - not what they saw , but what they felt . painted by schmitt-rottluff , a sailboat seascape becomes a kaleidoscope of swirling colors , which evoke the joy and magic of a summer day at sea .
a reclining nude by kirchner , painted with bold , impulsive strokes of bright red , the shadows of her curves in blue and green , is striking and sensual , comforting and warm . the artists rejected not only the established conventions and aesthetics of classical art , but also its techniques , devising their own painting methods as they went along . though in terms of creative expression their techniques were very effective , they were also impractical , bruecke museum director magdalena moeller explained . " the artists were self-taught , " she remarked .
" they studied architecture , not art , and did n't know how to prepare canvases or work with oil paint . " the artists simply applied the paint right from the tube to the canvas .
" this was a completely unorthodox way to work with oil paints , " she said .
" and this is also why their paintings are so fragile ; the paint is not stabile on the canvas , and why today these works must be transported with such care . " bruecke at its climax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " farn in the marsch " by emil nolde , one of the great 20th-century water color painters up until 1910 , the group had developed a distinct collective style , taking as their subjects the natural beauty of landscapes and the human form .
each artist had his own individual technique , yet their works as a whole from this period possess simplicity of depiction , vibrant use of color and exquisite compositional harmony .
this period is seen as the climax of the bruecke 's artistic achievements . the bruecke artists moved to berlin in 1911 , where big city life greatly influenced their work .
sharp angles , edgy , brittle brushwork and a subdued color palette became their defining stylistic elements .
they focused on street scenes and austere portraits . in 1913 , personal and professional differences caused the group to disband , but the artists continued to work separately , with each gaining individual recognition by the 1920s . " of course in the ' 30s with the national socialists , they were all defamed as ' degenerate ' artists , " stoike said .
" they were re-established after the second world war , but figurative art was no longer favored then since it had been exploited by the nazis for propaganda reasons . " the art of the bruecke , although expressionistic , proved too figurative for the times and fell out of fashion .
tastes for more abstract art were developing , with artists like wassily kandinsky grabbing attention on the world art stage . still , over time , the bruecke became synonymous with the german expressionist movement , and took its rightful place within the international avant-garde . renewed bruecke popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city life influenced their work , like kirchner 's " berlin street scene " these days , the bruecke is enjoying a new surge of international popularity , claims museum director moeller .
her museum has recently had an increase in requests for loans of up to 150 works from renowned art institutions around the world , such as moscow 's pushkin museum , london 's royal academy and new york 's museum of modern art , to name a few . even the french are acquiring a taste for early german expressionists , with the first bruecke exhibition ever to take place in france next year . moeller said it was the simplicity and straight-forwardness of bruecke art that made it so appealing today .
" it 's not abstract or complicated or burdened with problems the viewer has to interpret ; nor is bruecke art a conceptual art so that you need additional knowledge to understand , " she pointed out . viewers can just sit back , relax and take in the vibrant colors and clear , simple lines .
the unorthodox approach to art created back then was a stroke of fate , stoike explained . " it was a movement against the bourgeoisie society , " stoike said .
" the artists loved to work outside , close to nature and inspired by it .

now on show is a retrospective of paintings by erich heckel . the largest collection of works from the german expressionist group die bruecke -lrb- " the bridge " -rrb- is housed in a modest , one-story building on the outskirts of berlin . the bruecke collective was founded in dresden in 1905 by four university students , who abandoned their studies to devote themselves to art . the founders - ernst ludwig kirchner , fritz beyl , erich heckel , and karl schmidt-rotluff - were obsessed with the desire to create a new type of art that , in their words , was " immediate and pure . " " their goal was to revolutionize art , and they did revolutionize german art because they wanted to portray inner emotions and their subjective perceptions and that was something very new at the time , " art academic kathy stoike told deutsche welle . the way the artists depicted objects and people was very new , and not understood at the time , stoike pointed out . " you see a storm of colors , and you have to imagine that the people in 1905 did n't have any color photography , any movies , and the neon lights you have today , they did n't exist , " she said .
" it was all a bit darker , and black and white . " from the heart to the canvas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this painting , " roman stilllife , " by erich heckel was stolen from the bruecke musuem in 2002 bruecke artists strove to capture their inner perception on canvas - not what they saw , but what they felt . painted by schmitt-rottluff , a sailboat seascape becomes a kaleidoscope of swirling colors , which evoke the joy and magic of a summer day at sea .
a reclining nude by kirchner , painted with bold , impulsive strokes of bright red , the shadows of her curves in blue and green , is striking and sensual , comforting and warm . the artists rejected not only the established conventions and aesthetics of classical art , but also its techniques , devising their own painting methods as they went along . though in terms of creative expression their techniques were very effective , they were also impractical , bruecke museum director magdalena moeller explained . " the artists were self-taught , " she remarked .
" they studied architecture , not art , and did n't know how to prepare canvases or work with oil paint . " the artists simply applied the paint right from the tube to the canvas .
" this was a completely unorthodox way to work with oil paints , " she said .
" and this is also why their paintings are so fragile ; the paint is not stabile on the canvas , and why today these works must be transported with such care . " bruecke at its climax bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " farn in the marsch " by emil nolde , one of the great 20th-century water color painters up until 1910 , the group had developed a distinct collective style , taking as their subjects the natural beauty of landscapes and the human form .
each artist had his own individual technique , yet their works as a whole from this period possess simplicity of depiction , vibrant use of color and exquisite compositional harmony .
this period is seen as the climax of the bruecke 's artistic achievements . the bruecke artists moved to berlin in 1911 , where big city life greatly influenced their work .
sharp angles , edgy , brittle brushwork and a subdued color palette became their defining stylistic elements .
they focused on street scenes and austere portraits . in 1913 , personal and professional differences caused the group to disband , but the artists continued to work separately , with each gaining individual recognition by the 1920s . " of course in the ' 30s with the national socialists , they were all defamed as ' degenerate ' artists , " stoike said .
" they were re-established after the second world war , but figurative art was no longer favored then since it had been exploited by the nazis for propaganda reasons . " the art of the bruecke , although expressionistic , proved too figurative for the times and fell out of fashion .
tastes for more abstract art were developing , with artists like wassily kandinsky grabbing attention on the world art stage . still , over time , the bruecke became synonymous with the german expressionist movement , and took its rightful place within the international avant-garde . renewed bruecke popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city life influenced their work , like kirchner 's " berlin street scene " these days , the bruecke is enjoying a new surge of international popularity , claims museum director moeller .
her museum has recently had an increase in requests for loans of up to 150 works from renowned art institutions around the world , such as moscow 's pushkin museum , london 's royal academy and new york 's museum of modern art , to name a few . even the french are acquiring a taste for early german expressionists , with the first bruecke exhibition ever to take place in france next year . moeller said it was the simplicity and straight-forwardness of bruecke art that made it so appealing today .
" it 's not abstract or complicated or burdened with problems the viewer has to interpret ; nor is bruecke art a conceptual art so that you need additional knowledge to understand , " she pointed out . viewers can just sit back , relax and take in the vibrant colors and clear , simple lines .
the unorthodox approach to art created back then was a stroke of fate , stoike explained . " it was a movement against the bourgeoisie society , " stoike said .
" the artists loved to work outside , close to nature and inspired by it .

but important differences in gay life still remain . as germany celebrates the 20th anniversary of reunification , the former east-west divide in the country 's gay and lesbian rights movement has all but disappeared .
there is currently close cooperation between gay and lesbian activists in the eastern and western states , according to eduard stapel , founder of several gay rights groups in former east germany .
unlike the united states , where gay rights vary widely from state to state , the legal rights of gays and lesbians are virtually the same in the east and west .
" that 's apart from the fact that we 've made slightly more progress in eastern germany , with discrimination bans in the berlin , brandenburg and thuringia state constitutions , " stapel told deutsche welle .
" but that has little effect on everyday life . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays in berlin enjoy one of the most accepting environments social acceptance of homosexuality is also roughly the same in eastern and western states , according to a 2001 study by the opinion research group tns emnid .
the study found that nearly the same percentage of people in the east as in the west say homosexuality is no longer objectionable .
the highest percentage of acceptance was in berlin , while the lowest was in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
gay life in former east germany while there is very little documentation of gay life in former east germany , a unique exception is the 1989 film " coming out . "
it follows a young teacher in east berlin struggling to accept his gay identity , and was the first and only gay-themed film produced in east germany .
it also won the second-place silver bear prize in the 1990 berlin film festival .
the film 's premiere was coincidentally held on november 9 , 1989 , the same night east german authorities opened the border to the west and people from across germany began to tear down the berlin wall .
matthias freihof , who played the protagonist phillip , said when he was first offered the leading role in the film , he knew it would be a major boost to his career .
the director , heiner carow , was one of the most well-known and respected directors in all of east germany .
what freihof did not anticipate was the long-lasting effect " coming out " would have on gay cinema .
bildunterschrift : " coming out " won the silver bear award at the 1990 berlin film festival " i 'm on the way to different festivals almost every year , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is very astonishing for me , that this film still has the power to entertain people , to pull them into the story . "
" coming out " was made at a time of huge political upheaval in all of eastern europe , just as the east german gay and lesbian community was becoming more visible .
the first gay-themed theater production , a growing number of books and resources on homosexuality all marked the beginnings of an organized gay rights movement .
" there was a kind of liberation coming up in the early 80s , so the step to do a film about this subject was clear , " freihof said .
" but the officials did n't like the idea , of course , because they knew about the subject , but they did n't want to make a big thing out of it . "
reunification depoliticizes the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stapel founded many east german gay organizations under a repressive government , political activism actually flourished in east germany , stapel said .
gays rights activists , alongside feminists , human rights activists and environmentalists , formed a strong and unified civil rights movement that opposed the east german authoritarian state .
political activism there filled the void left by the absence of a real social scene , like bars , restaurants and movie theaters , stapel said .
but after the fall of the berlin wall and the emergence of capitalism in east germany , the gay community became less political and less organized .
" people in communist east germany would go wherever things were happening , and that was the case with political groups , " stapel said .
" but when all of a sudden there is a social scene , then there 's no more reason to go to political groups . "
film shows far-right extremism an important exception to the depoliticization in eastern germany is the rise of right-wing extremism .
neo-nazi groups have grown in the east since reunification , which freihof said was easily foreseen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazism has been a growing problem in the east " our film was the first film that showed the neo-nazis in east berlin , because that was something nobody was talking about from official side , " he said .
" so after the wall came down , this problem became bigger and bigger , and for us it was not surprising . "
in one scene of " coming out , " freihof 's character phillip witnesses a group of neo-nazis attacking a young man they believe is gay in a subway station .
such attacks were not uncommon , freihof said , as far-right groups became more active and increasingly targeted the gay community .
" it happened sometimes that neo-nazi groups went to gay places to fight with the people , " freihof said .
but the rise of right-wing extremism in the east since reunification and its influence on violence against gays should not be overstated , according to stapel .
one of the more pressing concerns there is discrimination in the workplace .
" many people in the east are much more afraid now than during communism of losing their jobs because of their sexuality , " he said .
" i do n't think that 's likely , but people are afraid . " author : andrew bowen editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" coming out " was made at a time of huge political upheaval in all of eastern europe , just as the east german gay and lesbian community was becoming more visible .
the first gay-themed theater production , a growing number of books and resources on homosexuality all marked the beginnings of an organized gay rights movement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de civil rights -pipe- 02.10.2010 gay rights movement in germany follows path of reunification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay legal rights vary little from east to west twenty years after reunification , there is close cooperation between gay activists in eastern and western germany .
but important differences in gay life still remain . as germany celebrates the 20th anniversary of reunification , the former east-west divide in the country 's gay and lesbian rights movement has all but disappeared .
there is currently close cooperation between gay and lesbian activists in the eastern and western states , according to eduard stapel , founder of several gay rights groups in former east germany .
unlike the united states , where gay rights vary widely from state to state , the legal rights of gays and lesbians are virtually the same in the east and west .
" that 's apart from the fact that we 've made slightly more progress in eastern germany , with discrimination bans in the berlin , brandenburg and thuringia state constitutions , " stapel told deutsche welle .
" but that has little effect on everyday life . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays in berlin enjoy one of the most accepting environments social acceptance of homosexuality is also roughly the same in eastern and western states , according to a 2001 study by the opinion research group tns emnid .
the study found that nearly the same percentage of people in the east as in the west say homosexuality is no longer objectionable .
the highest percentage of acceptance was in berlin , while the lowest was in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
gay life in former east germany while there is very little documentation of gay life in former east germany , a unique exception is the 1989 film " coming out . "
it follows a young teacher in east berlin struggling to accept his gay identity , and was the first and only gay-themed film produced in east germany .
it also won the second-place silver bear prize in the 1990 berlin film festival .
the film 's premiere was coincidentally held on november 9 , 1989 , the same night east german authorities opened the border to the west and people from across germany began to tear down the berlin wall .
matthias freihof , who played the protagonist phillip , said when he was first offered the leading role in the film , he knew it would be a major boost to his career .
the director , heiner carow , was one of the most well-known and respected directors in all of east germany .
what freihof did not anticipate was the long-lasting effect " coming out " would have on gay cinema .
bildunterschrift : " coming out " won the silver bear award at the 1990 berlin film festival " i 'm on the way to different festivals almost every year , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is very astonishing for me , that this film still has the power to entertain people , to pull them into the story . "
" coming out " was made at a time of huge political upheaval in all of eastern europe , just as the east german gay and lesbian community was becoming more visible .
the first gay-themed theater production , a growing number of books and resources on homosexuality all marked the beginnings of an organized gay rights movement .
" there was a kind of liberation coming up in the early 80s , so the step to do a film about this subject was clear , " freihof said .
" but the officials did n't like the idea , of course , because they knew about the subject , but they did n't want to make a big thing out of it . "
reunification depoliticizes the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stapel founded many east german gay organizations under a repressive government , political activism actually flourished in east germany , stapel said .
gays rights activists , alongside feminists , human rights activists and environmentalists , formed a strong and unified civil rights movement that opposed the east german authoritarian state .
political activism there filled the void left by the absence of a real social scene , like bars , restaurants and movie theaters , stapel said .
but after the fall of the berlin wall and the emergence of capitalism in east germany , the gay community became less political and less organized .
" people in communist east germany would go wherever things were happening , and that was the case with political groups , " stapel said .
" but when all of a sudden there is a social scene , then there 's no more reason to go to political groups . "
film shows far-right extremism an important exception to the depoliticization in eastern germany is the rise of right-wing extremism .
neo-nazi groups have grown in the east since reunification , which freihof said was easily foreseen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazism has been a growing problem in the east " our film was the first film that showed the neo-nazis in east berlin , because that was something nobody was talking about from official side , " he said .
" so after the wall came down , this problem became bigger and bigger , and for us it was not surprising . "
in one scene of " coming out , " freihof 's character phillip witnesses a group of neo-nazis attacking a young man they believe is gay in a subway station .
such attacks were not uncommon , freihof said , as far-right groups became more active and increasingly targeted the gay community .
" it happened sometimes that neo-nazi groups went to gay places to fight with the people , " freihof said .
but the rise of right-wing extremism in the east since reunification and its influence on violence against gays should not be overstated , according to stapel .
one of the more pressing concerns there is discrimination in the workplace .
" many people in the east are much more afraid now than during communism of losing their jobs because of their sexuality , " he said .
" i do n't think that 's likely , but people are afraid . " author : andrew bowen editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there is currently close cooperation between gay and lesbian activists in the eastern and western states , according to eduard stapel , founder of several gay rights groups in former east germany .
unlike the united states , where gay rights vary widely from state to state , the legal rights of gays and lesbians are virtually the same in the east and west .
" that 's apart from the fact that we 've made slightly more progress in eastern germany , with discrimination bans in the berlin , brandenburg and thuringia state constitutions , " stapel told deutsche welle .
" but that has little effect on everyday life . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gays in berlin enjoy one of the most accepting environments social acceptance of homosexuality is also roughly the same in eastern and western states , according to a 2001 study by the opinion research group tns emnid .
the study found that nearly the same percentage of people in the east as in the west say homosexuality is no longer objectionable .
the highest percentage of acceptance was in berlin , while the lowest was in the western state of rhineland-palatinate .
gay life in former east germany while there is very little documentation of gay life in former east germany , a unique exception is the 1989 film " coming out . "
it follows a young teacher in east berlin struggling to accept his gay identity , and was the first and only gay-themed film produced in east germany .
it also won the second-place silver bear prize in the 1990 berlin film festival .
the film 's premiere was coincidentally held on november 9 , 1989 , the same night east german authorities opened the border to the west and people from across germany began to tear down the berlin wall .
matthias freihof , who played the protagonist phillip , said when he was first offered the leading role in the film , he knew it would be a major boost to his career .
the director , heiner carow , was one of the most well-known and respected directors in all of east germany .
what freihof did not anticipate was the long-lasting effect " coming out " would have on gay cinema .
bildunterschrift : " coming out " won the silver bear award at the 1990 berlin film festival " i 'm on the way to different festivals almost every year , " he told deutsche welle .
" this is very astonishing for me , that this film still has the power to entertain people , to pull them into the story . "
" coming out " was made at a time of huge political upheaval in all of eastern europe , just as the east german gay and lesbian community was becoming more visible .
the first gay-themed theater production , a growing number of books and resources on homosexuality all marked the beginnings of an organized gay rights movement .
" there was a kind of liberation coming up in the early 80s , so the step to do a film about this subject was clear , " freihof said .
" but the officials did n't like the idea , of course , because they knew about the subject , but they did n't want to make a big thing out of it . "
reunification depoliticizes the east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stapel founded many east german gay organizations under a repressive government , political activism actually flourished in east germany , stapel said .
gays rights activists , alongside feminists , human rights activists and environmentalists , formed a strong and unified civil rights movement that opposed the east german authoritarian state .
political activism there filled the void left by the absence of a real social scene , like bars , restaurants and movie theaters , stapel said .
but after the fall of the berlin wall and the emergence of capitalism in east germany , the gay community became less political and less organized .
" people in communist east germany would go wherever things were happening , and that was the case with political groups , " stapel said .
" but when all of a sudden there is a social scene , then there 's no more reason to go to political groups . "
film shows far-right extremism an important exception to the depoliticization in eastern germany is the rise of right-wing extremism .
neo-nazi groups have grown in the east since reunification , which freihof said was easily foreseen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neo-nazism has been a growing problem in the east " our film was the first film that showed the neo-nazis in east berlin , because that was something nobody was talking about from official side , " he said .
" so after the wall came down , this problem became bigger and bigger , and for us it was not surprising . "
in one scene of " coming out , " freihof 's character phillip witnesses a group of neo-nazis attacking a young man they believe is gay in a subway station .
such attacks were not uncommon , freihof said , as far-right groups became more active and increasingly targeted the gay community .
" it happened sometimes that neo-nazi groups went to gay places to fight with the people , " freihof said .
but the rise of right-wing extremism in the east since reunification and its influence on violence against gays should not be overstated , according to stapel .
one of the more pressing concerns there is discrimination in the workplace .
" many people in the east are much more afraid now than during communism of losing their jobs because of their sexuality , " he said .
" i do n't think that 's likely , but people are afraid . " author : andrew bowen editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

october 3 has been a public holiday since , with the northern port city of bremen this year taking its turn as the lead city for the celebrations .
the city has been turned into a venue for concerts , street parties , parades and appearances by leading politicians .
" today , we remember the brave citizens who fought for freedom .
that 's why we 're celebrating today with a citizens ' festival , " bremen mayor and the current president of the upper house of the german parliament , jens boehrnsen said on saturday as he kicked off the festivities .
