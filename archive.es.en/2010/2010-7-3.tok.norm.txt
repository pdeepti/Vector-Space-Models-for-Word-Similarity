miroslav klose scored twice , along with goals from thomas mueller and defender arne friedrich . germany have scored four goals for the third time in the world cup , this time dispatching argentina with shocking ease in the quarterfinal .
" now we 're among the best four teams in the world , and that 's exactly where this team belongs , " coach joachim loew said after the game .
" our destiny is in our own hands now , we can achieve something really great here . "
bildunterschrift : coach joachim loew , center , had every reason to cheer as his side banged in four goals - again the germans got off to a flying start , scoring the quickest goal of the world cup this year against a shocked argentina backline , with thomas mueller heading home a free-kick in just the third minute .
the 20-year-old mueller , who was a two-goal hero against england in the previous round , has now scored four in the competition from his position on the right flank .
" it 's insane , after thrashing argentina 4-0 , i 'm almost lost for words , " mueller told reporters after the match .
" the star today , once again , was the team as a whole . "
mueller , however , will play no part in the semifinal .
the bayern munich man picked up his second yellow card of the competition from a handball call that was more than a bit questionable by the referee , meaning he will serve a one-match ban .
" i hope that my teammates get everything right in the semifnal , then i can come back and score another goal in the final , " the upbeat youngster concluded .
scorer turns provider despite this setback , mueller remained a key man going forward for joachim loew 's men , and displayed fantastic determination and awareness in the build up for germany 's second goal .
even after losing his footing , a seated mueller played a great through-ball for lukas podolski on the left wing , who delivered the perfect cross to miroslav klose in front of goal .
after argentine goalie sergio romero dived for the cross and missed , klose simply had to tap the ball into an open net .
moments later arne friedrich - pushing forward from the center of defense - put the finishing touches on a great cross from bastian schweinsteiger to make it 3-0 germany with just a quarter of an hour to play .
closing in on the record bildunterschrift : miroslav klose , left , only needs two more goals to become the world cup 's deadliest ever striker in the dying minutes , with argentina clearly broken , germany made it four , again through miroslav klose .
the veteran 's 100th game for his country could hardly have been scripted better .
with his second-half brace , the frontman grabbed his 13th and 14th career world cup goals , meaning he is now level with legendary striker gerd mueller as the most prolific german in world cup history .
he only needs one more to tie the overall record of 15 goals , held by the brazilian goal-machine ronaldo .
schweinsteiger shines holding midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who has excelled while filling the boots of injured german captain michael ballack during the competition , was awarded man of the match for his performance .

schweinsteiger has replaced ballack in style schweinsteiger set up germany 's first and third goals , but his most crucial contribution was controlling the game in the middle of the park from start to finish .
" we may have to play spain next , " the man of the match cautioned after the victory .
" they 're the best team in the world , in my view .
but we 're good enough , we believe in ourselves . "

" even before the game , they 're at it .
the way they gesture , their attempts to influence the referee .
it shows a lack of respect , but that 's just the way the argentines are . "
bastian schweinsteiger , making clear what he thinks of argentina this week .
he also shared his most vivid memory of the game between the two sides at the same quarterfinal stage of the 2006 tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger did n't mince words about argentina " what i remember most is what happened after the game , the brawl which was triggered by the argentinians , " said the germany midfielder .
referring to that fight , captain philipp lahm said he thought its genesis was simple : the argentines " do n't know how to lose . "
the post-match melee meant a suspension for schweinsteiger 's predecessor in germany 's holding midfield role , torsten frings .
the german team went on to lose their next match to italy , and many in germany still feel frings ' absence was decisive in the semi-final defeat .
schweinsteiger said nothing of the kind would happen this time .
" we will not be intimidated or respond to their provocations .
i hope the referee will be watching the game closely , " he said .
returning fire … or holding it ?
having been provoked , the argentina camp wasted little time in firing back - through the ever-passionate carlos tevez .
" i was more afraid of mexico than germany , " tevez told the argentine newspaper clarin .
" the mexicans play better football . "
ouch .
bildunterschrift : just as he was in 2006 , tevez will be a handful for german defenders like arne friedrich other than tevez 's snap , however , the south americans tried to stay low-key .
martin demichelis , who plays in germany for bayern munich , said their recent record against germany does all the talking .
" all the criticisms they make are a sign of respect and nerves .
since we beat them in march , they respect us , " he said .
argentina defeated germany in that recent friendly in munich 1-0 - a score line that flattered the comprehensively beaten hosts .
upon hearing schweinsteiger 's comments , coach diego maradona was even more dismissive .
he said his team " did n't have time to think about schweinsteiger " and ended a television interview by teasing the player .
" what 's the matter with you , schweinsteiger ?
are you getting nervous ? " said the football legend , in a mock-german accent .
switching focus just over 24 hours before the match , however , germany coach joachim loew tried to change the tone of the conversation .

" even before the game , they 're at it .
the way they gesture , their attempts to influence the referee .
it shows a lack of respect , but that 's just the way the argentines are . "
bastian schweinsteiger , making clear what he thinks of argentina this week .
he also shared his most vivid memory of the game between the two sides at the same quarterfinal stage of the 2006 tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger did n't mince words about argentina " what i remember most is what happened after the game , the brawl which was triggered by the argentinians , " said the germany midfielder .
referring to that fight , captain philipp lahm said he thought its genesis was simple : the argentines " do n't know how to lose . "
the post-match melee meant a suspension for schweinsteiger 's predecessor in germany 's holding midfield role , torsten frings .
the german team went on to lose their next match to italy , and many in germany still feel frings ' absence was decisive in the semi-final defeat .
schweinsteiger said nothing of the kind would happen this time .
" we will not be intimidated or respond to their provocations .
i hope the referee will be watching the game closely , " he said .
returning fire … or holding it ?
having been provoked , the argentina camp wasted little time in firing back - through the ever-passionate carlos tevez .
" i was more afraid of mexico than germany , " tevez told the argentine newspaper clarin .
" the mexicans play better football . "
ouch .
bildunterschrift : just as he was in 2006 , tevez will be a handful for german defenders like arne friedrich other than tevez 's snap , however , the south americans tried to stay low-key .
martin demichelis , who plays in germany for bayern munich , said their recent record against germany does all the talking .
" all the criticisms they make are a sign of respect and nerves .
since we beat them in march , they respect us , " he said .
argentina defeated germany in that recent friendly in munich 1-0 - a score line that flattered the comprehensively beaten hosts .
upon hearing schweinsteiger 's comments , coach diego maradona was even more dismissive .
he said his team " did n't have time to think about schweinsteiger " and ended a television interview by teasing the player .
" what 's the matter with you , schweinsteiger ?
are you getting nervous ? " said the football legend , in a mock-german accent .
switching focus just over 24 hours before the match , however , germany coach joachim loew tried to change the tone of the conversation .

miroslav klose scored twice , along with goals from thomas mueller and defender arne friedrich . germany have scored four goals for the third time in the world cup , this time dispatching argentina with shocking ease in the quarterfinal .
" now we 're among the best four teams in the world , and that 's exactly where this team belongs , " coach joachim loew said after the game .
" our destiny is in our own hands now , we can achieve something really great here . "
bildunterschrift : coach joachim loew , center , had every reason to cheer as his side banged in four goals - again the germans got off to a flying start , scoring the quickest goal of the world cup this year against a shocked argentina backline , with thomas mueller heading home a free-kick in just the third minute .
the 20-year-old mueller , who was a two-goal hero against england in the previous round , has now scored four in the competition from his position on the right flank .
" it 's insane , after thrashing argentina 4-0 , i 'm almost lost for words , " mueller told reporters after the match .
" the star today , once again , was the team as a whole . "
mueller , however , will play no part in the semifinal .
the bayern munich man picked up his second yellow card of the competition from a handball call that was more than a bit questionable by the referee , meaning he will serve a one-match ban .
" i hope that my teammates get everything right in the semifnal , then i can come back and score another goal in the final , " the upbeat youngster concluded .
scorer turns provider despite this setback , mueller remained a key man going forward for joachim loew 's men , and displayed fantastic determination and awareness in the build up for germany 's second goal .
even after losing his footing , a seated mueller played a great through-ball for lukas podolski on the left wing , who delivered the perfect cross to miroslav klose in front of goal .
after argentine goalie sergio romero dived for the cross and missed , klose simply had to tap the ball into an open net .
moments later arne friedrich - pushing forward from the center of defense - put the finishing touches on a great cross from bastian schweinsteiger to make it 3-0 germany with just a quarter of an hour to play .
closing in on the record bildunterschrift : miroslav klose , left , only needs two more goals to become the world cup 's deadliest ever striker in the dying minutes , with argentina clearly broken , germany made it four , again through miroslav klose .
the veteran 's 100th game for his country could hardly have been scripted better .
with his second-half brace , the frontman grabbed his 13th and 14th career world cup goals , meaning he is now level with legendary striker gerd mueller as the most prolific german in world cup history .
he only needs one more to tie the overall record of 15 goals , held by the brazilian goal-machine ronaldo .
schweinsteiger shines holding midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who has excelled while filling the boots of injured german captain michael ballack during the competition , was awarded man of the match for his performance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael who ?
schweinsteiger has replaced ballack in style schweinsteiger set up germany 's first and third goals , but his most crucial contribution was controlling the game in the middle of the park from start to finish .
" we may have to play spain next , " the man of the match cautioned after the victory .
" they 're the best team in the world , in my view .
but we 're good enough , we believe in ourselves . "
germany will now face either european champions spain or paraguay , who play on saturday evening , in the semifinals .

in front of more than 1,000 cheering onlookers at a packed concert hall in the capital bishkek , otunbayeva somberly took her oath and promised a new political era for crisis-ridden kyrgyzstan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic violence has died down since erupting in april " as president , i will spare no effort to create a new political culture for the country based on a strict adherence to the rule of law , " she told the assembled crowd .
" i must be principled and consistently make demands on all branches of government to ensure it .
the new policy can not be built on fantasies and illusions .
it must be real and effective . "
inauguration comes at delicate moment otunbayeva takes over the government as kyrgyzstan has been wracked by violence and political instability .
thousands have died in ethnic violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks since then-president kurmanbek bakiyev was removed from power in a bloody coup in april .
at least 75,000 people fled to neighboring uzbekistan , leading international aid agencies to warn of an impending humanitarian crisis in dealing with the thousands of families left homeless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of thousands remain homeless in the south the inauguration comes just days after the country overwhelmingly approved a new constitution that will make kyrgyzstan the region 's first parliamentary democracy , a move the government hopes will bring a measure of stability .
the new constitution slashes the powers of the president and sets the stage for parliamentary elections that authorities have scheduled for early october to bring in a permanent government .
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , has questioned the feasibility of kyrgyzstan 's aspirations for a parliamentary democracy , warning that it could lead to further instability in the country and the region .
he said last week on the sidelines of the g20 summit in toronto that a lack of autocratic rule in kyrgyzstan could result in a " relapse into factionalism , " giving rise to a " breeding ground for islamist extremism . "

in front of more than 1,000 cheering onlookers at a packed concert hall in the capital bishkek , otunbayeva somberly took her oath and promised a new political era for crisis-ridden kyrgyzstan .

russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , has questioned the feasibility of kyrgyzstan 's aspirations for a parliamentary democracy , warning that it could lead to further instability in the country and the region .
he said last week on the sidelines of the g20 summit in toronto that a lack of autocratic rule in kyrgyzstan could result in a " relapse into factionalism , " giving rise to a " breeding ground for islamist extremism . "

" we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .
" these children then go to hamas 's koran schools , " she said , adding that the blockade could thus only fuel radical islamism . an end to isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will not apologize for raiding aid ships social democrat mp rolf muetzenich supports mueller 's criticism of the blockade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 03.07.2010 ' mechanical doping ' mars start of tour de france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using motorized bikes is said to be the latest form of doping as the 97th tour de france gets underway in rotterdam in the netherlands this saturday , bikes are to be scanned for illegal motors , a practice that has been dubbed mechanical doping . bikes used at the tour de france , which starts in rotterdam this saturday and ends in paris on july 25 , will be scanned for illegal motors , following rumors that swiss rider fabian cancellara used so-called mechanical doping in the tour of flanders and the paris-roubaix .
in a film circulated on the video-sharing website youtube , former tour de france cyclist davide cassani reveals this new form of cheating - riding bikes that are , in fact , motorbikes in disguise .
" these machines have been around since 2004 and they have been used in races by professional cyclists , " cassani told france 's rtl radio .
" there are a lot of benefits using such a bike .
you can reach 50 kilometers an hour .
it has its motor in the frame and a battery between the pedals , " he explains .
suspicious bike swap the italian tv corporation rai has alleged that cancellara swapped bikes suspiciously during the recent paris-roubaix race before going on to victory .
the rider , however , insists the suggestion he used mechanical doping is ridiculous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's fabian cancellara has been linked with mechanical doping but the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- is erring on the side of caution - on june 18 it announced it would tighten its bike checking procedures by introducing a new type of scanner .
" from now on , race service will be subject to stricter regulation in order to ensure that only equipment that has been checked at the start or finish can be used during competitions , " the uci said in a statement .
doping scandals meanwhile , drugs doping is once again casting a shadow over the tour .
italian rider riccardo ricco tested positive three days before the off and doping revelations from former rider floyd landis have implicated seven-time winner lance armstrong , who is taking part in what he says will be his last tour this year .
ricco was handed a two-month suspended jail sentence and a 3,000 euro fine for doping during the 2008 tour de france by a french court on tuesday .
the tour 's organizers insist , however , that it is now harder than ever to cheat .
" considerable progress has been made these past two years , " says christian prudhomme , director of the tour de france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's ricco was handed a suspended sentence for doping during the 2008 tour " now cyclists have to report where they are morning , noon and night every day of the tour .
they also have to carry a biological passport which is designed to root out not only cheats who test positively in traditional tests but those who do n't but whose blood changes its composition suspiciously over time , " he explains .
riders are also subjected to surprise tests before and during the tour .
criticism from the anti-doping agency the french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- , which this year will not be taking part in the drug control process , says that relying on biological passports alone is dangerous .
the afld says additional information from customs authorities and police investigations is needed in the fight against doping .
it also accused the icu of giving preferential treatment to riders such as lance armstrong and last year 's winner alberto contador when it came to surprise testing .
the icu and the afld have a long history of clashes .
in 2009 , they worked together during the tour de france , but the partnership was a failure , according to afld president pierre bordry , who said it would have been impossible to renew the partnership this year .

" we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .
" these children then go to hamas 's koran schools , " she said , adding that the blockade could thus only fuel radical islamism . an end to isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will not apologize for raiding aid ships social democrat mp rolf muetzenich supports mueller 's criticism of the blockade .
muetzenich has called for not only humanitarian aid to gaza , but support to help the region rebuild itself economically and end its political isolation . " we must promote the message among the palestinian fractions that only a government of national unity will allow for an ongoing and just peace solution in palestine - and then be of benefit to israel , " he said . all bundestag fractions agreed that an end to the blockade would indeed benefit israel .

the gigantic eurozone rescue plan has succeeded , at least for now , in stabilizing the common european currency .
but capital markets remain skeptical .
the search for a remedy continues . in the eyes of many experts , the euro is still ailing .
but what they do n't know is whether it 's just a cold , which can be treated , or a terminal illness .
no one seems to have the right remedy .
that worries hans-olaf henkel , the former president of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- who also served as managing director of ibm deutschland : he believes the euro has failed and gives germany part of the blame .
" we have not complied with our own guidelines , which certainly would have made the euro a success , " henkel said .
together with the french government , he adds , the german government weakened the stability pact by breaching its criteria – " without an emergency , without a financial or economic crisis , and without a euro crisis . "
' greece isnt 't entirely to blame ' european parliamentarian elmar brok , a member of germany 's christian democratic union party , agrees that greece is n't entirely to blame for the euro mess .
" often the feeling in brussels is that if the big nations need to bend the rules , they change the rules , " brok said .
" but when the smaller nations try to bend the rules , they 're hung out to dry .
we need to make perfectly clear that we germans have a responsibility to restore trust in our own standing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bdi president hans-olaf henkel believes the euro has failed but the german government 's hesitant response to the crisis has shaken trust in the euro .
at the beginning of may , the european union agreed to a 750-billion-euro rescue package for the common currency – in a bid to calm turbulent financial markets .
after grinding its gears , the german government switched into the fast lane and approved 147 billion euros in aid .
andreas schmitz , president of the association of german banks , believes berlin moved too fast , however .
" if the money is already lying in front of you on the table , you grab it , " he said .
" a better idea is to dangle the money and be told that it 's all yours if you 're willing to accept certain conditions . "
european currency watchdogs observers agree the eu will have to live with its own mistakes as it searches for remedies to cure the ailing euro .
the european monetary fund , favored by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , has been sharply criticized by european currency watchdogs .
they fear such a fund would allow debt-ridden nations to pull back on their austerity efforts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts argue for giving the european commission greater economic control another idea making the rounds is the establishment of a european economic government .
france hatched the idea and , until recently , stood alone in its support .
then germany showed interest and , more recently , members of the eu summit in june backed the notion of a common economic policy .
if there is to be an agreement , christian calliess , a european affairs expert at berlin 's free university , expects member states will be willing to give the eu greater economic control rather than responsibility for drafting economic policy .
" i can imagine plenty of control options , like giving greater responsibilities to the european commission and other community bodies to oversee the budgets of member states , " calliess said .
tough action if there is a consensus in the eurozone today , it 's to combat not the symptoms but the causes of the euro 's illness .
that means getting a handle on government debt to halt speculation against the euro .
and that , says calliess , implies taking some tough action .
" in the event of an extreme case like greece , we need to have the possibility of allowing a country to file for insolvency in much the same way a company does in the private sector , " he said .
for sure , this could be a risky operation but it 's one that could prevent the euro from becoming a chronically ill , weak currency .

the gigantic eurozone rescue plan has succeeded , at least for now , in stabilizing the common european currency .
but capital markets remain skeptical .
the search for a remedy continues . in the eyes of many experts , the euro is still ailing .
but what they do n't know is whether it 's just a cold , which can be treated , or a terminal illness .
no one seems to have the right remedy .
that worries hans-olaf henkel , the former president of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- who also served as managing director of ibm deutschland : he believes the euro has failed and gives germany part of the blame .
" we have not complied with our own guidelines , which certainly would have made the euro a success , " henkel said .
together with the french government , he adds , the german government weakened the stability pact by breaching its criteria – " without an emergency , without a financial or economic crisis , and without a euro crisis . "
' greece isnt 't entirely to blame ' european parliamentarian elmar brok , a member of germany 's christian democratic union party , agrees that greece is n't entirely to blame for the euro mess .
" often the feeling in brussels is that if the big nations need to bend the rules , they change the rules , " brok said .
" but when the smaller nations try to bend the rules , they 're hung out to dry .
we need to make perfectly clear that we germans have a responsibility to restore trust in our own standing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bdi president hans-olaf henkel believes the euro has failed but the german government 's hesitant response to the crisis has shaken trust in the euro .
at the beginning of may , the european union agreed to a 750-billion-euro rescue package for the common currency – in a bid to calm turbulent financial markets .
after grinding its gears , the german government switched into the fast lane and approved 147 billion euros in aid .
andreas schmitz , president of the association of german banks , believes berlin moved too fast , however .
" if the money is already lying in front of you on the table , you grab it , " he said .
" a better idea is to dangle the money and be told that it 's all yours if you 're willing to accept certain conditions . "
european currency watchdogs observers agree the eu will have to live with its own mistakes as it searches for remedies to cure the ailing euro .
the european monetary fund , favored by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , has been sharply criticized by european currency watchdogs .
they fear such a fund would allow debt-ridden nations to pull back on their austerity efforts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts argue for giving the european commission greater economic control another idea making the rounds is the establishment of a european economic government .
france hatched the idea and , until recently , stood alone in its support .
then germany showed interest and , more recently , members of the eu summit in june backed the notion of a common economic policy .
if there is to be an agreement , christian calliess , a european affairs expert at berlin 's free university , expects member states will be willing to give the eu greater economic control rather than responsibility for drafting economic policy .
" i can imagine plenty of control options , like giving greater responsibilities to the european commission and other community bodies to oversee the budgets of member states , " calliess said .
tough action if there is a consensus in the eurozone today , it 's to combat not the symptoms but the causes of the euro 's illness .
that means getting a handle on government debt to halt speculation against the euro .
and that , says calliess , implies taking some tough action .
" in the event of an extreme case like greece , we need to have the possibility of allowing a country to file for insolvency in much the same way a company does in the private sector , " he said .
for sure , this could be a risky operation but it 's one that could prevent the euro from becoming a chronically ill , weak currency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 03.07.2010 germany calls for an end to israel 's gaza blockade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mps say ending the blockade would benefit israel the german parliament has united in denouncing israel 's handling of gaza , calling for an end to the blockade . germany 's government called friday for an immediate end to the blockade of the gaza strip after a unanimous vote in the country 's bundestag parliament condemning israel 's handling of the territory . " we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .
" these children then go to hamas 's koran schools , " she said , adding that the blockade could thus only fuel radical islamism . an end to isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will not apologize for raiding aid ships social democrat mp rolf muetzenich supports mueller 's criticism of the blockade .
muetzenich has called for not only humanitarian aid to gaza , but support to help the region rebuild itself economically and end its political isolation . " we must promote the message among the palestinian fractions that only a government of national unity will allow for an ongoing and just peace solution in palestine - and then be of benefit to israel , " he said . all bundestag fractions agreed that an end to the blockade would indeed benefit israel .
" yet we must not lose sight of israel 's security needs , " said christian democrat philipp missfelder - to the applause of the house . author : bettina marx / dl -lrb- dpa -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .
" these children then go to hamas 's koran schools , " she said , adding that the blockade could thus only fuel radical islamism . an end to isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will not apologize for raiding aid ships social democrat mp rolf muetzenich supports mueller 's criticism of the blockade .
muetzenich has called for not only humanitarian aid to gaza , but support to help the region rebuild itself economically and end its political isolation . " we must promote the message among the palestinian fractions that only a government of national unity will allow for an ongoing and just peace solution in palestine - and then be of benefit to israel , " he said . all bundestag fractions agreed that an end to the blockade would indeed benefit israel .
" yet we must not lose sight of israel 's security needs , " said christian democrat philipp missfelder - to the applause of the house . author : bettina marx / dl -lrb- dpa -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a film circulated on the video-sharing website youtube , former tour de france cyclist davide cassani reveals this new form of cheating - riding bikes that are , in fact , motorbikes in disguise .
" these machines have been around since 2004 and they have been used in races by professional cyclists , " cassani told france 's rtl radio .
" there are a lot of benefits using such a bike .
you can reach 50 kilometers an hour .
it has its motor in the frame and a battery between the pedals , " he explains .
suspicious bike swap the italian tv corporation rai has alleged that cancellara swapped bikes suspiciously during the recent paris-roubaix race before going on to victory .
the rider , however , insists the suggestion he used mechanical doping is ridiculous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's fabian cancellara has been linked with mechanical doping but the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- is erring on the side of caution - on june 18 it announced it would tighten its bike checking procedures by introducing a new type of scanner .
" from now on , race service will be subject to stricter regulation in order to ensure that only equipment that has been checked at the start or finish can be used during competitions , " the uci said in a statement .
doping scandals meanwhile , drugs doping is once again casting a shadow over the tour .
italian rider riccardo ricco tested positive three days before the off and doping revelations from former rider floyd landis have implicated seven-time winner lance armstrong , who is taking part in what he says will be his last tour this year .
ricco was handed a two-month suspended jail sentence and a 3,000 euro fine for doping during the 2008 tour de france by a french court on tuesday .
the tour 's organizers insist , however , that it is now harder than ever to cheat .
" considerable progress has been made these past two years , " says christian prudhomme , director of the tour de france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's ricco was handed a suspended sentence for doping during the 2008 tour " now cyclists have to report where they are morning , noon and night every day of the tour .
they also have to carry a biological passport which is designed to root out not only cheats who test positively in traditional tests but those who do n't but whose blood changes its composition suspiciously over time , " he explains .
riders are also subjected to surprise tests before and during the tour .
criticism from the anti-doping agency the french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- , which this year will not be taking part in the drug control process , says that relying on biological passports alone is dangerous .
the afld says additional information from customs authorities and police investigations is needed in the fight against doping .
it also accused the icu of giving preferential treatment to riders such as lance armstrong and last year 's winner alberto contador when it came to surprise testing .
the icu and the afld have a long history of clashes .
in 2009 , they worked together during the tour de france , but the partnership was a failure , according to afld president pierre bordry , who said it would have been impossible to renew the partnership this year .

the us company hopes to succeed in a market where numerous german food retailers and internet startups so far have struggled - or failed . consumers in germany can now turn to amazon to purchase not only books , movies and other popular merchandise but also groceries , including fresh fruit , vegetables and meat .
the new online offering covers more than 35,000 products .
most of them are supplied by a network of more than 60 suppliers , including froodies , gourmantis and moevenpick .
same-day delivery delivery for edibles is the same as amazon 's normal service in germany , which is free for purchases above 20 euros .
and , initially in berlin and frankfurt , the company guarantees same-day delivery for orders made before 11 am .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is hoping that convenience will spur people to buy food online amazon has been selling a range of food products in the united states since 2006 , adding perishables like grapes and steaks a couple years ago .
but online food sales have been anything but easy .
prior to the launch of its own online grocery offer , the company made numerous investments in web-to-doorstep grocery delivery ventures in the us during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s .
homegrocer.com , kozo.com and webvan were among them .
all failed , largely due to the need to build up a massive logistical infrastructure .
short distances to stores since then , amazon claims it has learned to work with regional partners to overcome challenges such as sourcing local products and providing an uncomplicated delivery infrastructure .
this regional partnership model is what the company hopes to transplant successfully in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edeka is one of several big german supermarkets to test the waters for online food sales like the us , germany has seen its fair share of online grocers come and go .
" all of the big food retailers in germany , like edeka , real and rewe , have launched online delivery services , then discontinued them only to try again , but so far without huge success , " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert told deutsche welle .
" germany is a country of short distances to stores .
people are simply used to going to stores to buy their groceries . "
online food sales in germany , according to wolfgang adelwarth at market-research company gfk , account for less than 1 percent of the country 's 150-billion-plus grocery market .
trend toward convenience " i see a very limited market for online food sales , " adelwarth told deutsche welle .
" there is a market for speciality products , like wine , and there is a group of young professionals who are too busy too shop in stores , but beyond that i do n't see huge demand in germany . "
still , eggert points to a trend toward convenience among german consumers , both young and old , that could spur online food sales .
but a successful online grocery delivery service in the country , he warns , will not come quickly or cheaply .
" it will take time and money , which amazon has , " eggert said .
" the company clearly sees an opportunity . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 03.07.2010 online giant amazon enters the grocery business in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon started selling books , but has gone far beyond that amazon has begun selling food , including fresh products , to consumers in germany .
the us company hopes to succeed in a market where numerous german food retailers and internet startups so far have struggled - or failed . consumers in germany can now turn to amazon to purchase not only books , movies and other popular merchandise but also groceries , including fresh fruit , vegetables and meat .
the new online offering covers more than 35,000 products .
most of them are supplied by a network of more than 60 suppliers , including froodies , gourmantis and moevenpick .
same-day delivery delivery for edibles is the same as amazon 's normal service in germany , which is free for purchases above 20 euros .
and , initially in berlin and frankfurt , the company guarantees same-day delivery for orders made before 11 am .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is hoping that convenience will spur people to buy food online amazon has been selling a range of food products in the united states since 2006 , adding perishables like grapes and steaks a couple years ago .
but online food sales have been anything but easy .
prior to the launch of its own online grocery offer , the company made numerous investments in web-to-doorstep grocery delivery ventures in the us during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s .
homegrocer.com , kozo.com and webvan were among them .
all failed , largely due to the need to build up a massive logistical infrastructure .
short distances to stores since then , amazon claims it has learned to work with regional partners to overcome challenges such as sourcing local products and providing an uncomplicated delivery infrastructure .
this regional partnership model is what the company hopes to transplant successfully in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edeka is one of several big german supermarkets to test the waters for online food sales like the us , germany has seen its fair share of online grocers come and go .
" all of the big food retailers in germany , like edeka , real and rewe , have launched online delivery services , then discontinued them only to try again , but so far without huge success , " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert told deutsche welle .
" germany is a country of short distances to stores .
people are simply used to going to stores to buy their groceries . "
online food sales in germany , according to wolfgang adelwarth at market-research company gfk , account for less than 1 percent of the country 's 150-billion-plus grocery market .
trend toward convenience " i see a very limited market for online food sales , " adelwarth told deutsche welle .
" there is a market for speciality products , like wine , and there is a group of young professionals who are too busy too shop in stores , but beyond that i do n't see huge demand in germany . "
still , eggert points to a trend toward convenience among german consumers , both young and old , that could spur online food sales .
but a successful online grocery delivery service in the country , he warns , will not come quickly or cheaply .
" it will take time and money , which amazon has , " eggert said .
" the company clearly sees an opportunity . "

" now we 're among the best four teams in the world , and that 's exactly where this team belongs , " coach joachim loew said after the game .
" our destiny is in our own hands now , we can achieve something really great here . "
bildunterschrift : coach joachim loew , center , had every reason to cheer as his side banged in four goals - again the germans got off to a flying start , scoring the quickest goal of the world cup this year against a shocked argentina backline , with thomas mueller heading home a free-kick in just the third minute .
the 20-year-old mueller , who was a two-goal hero against england in the previous round , has now scored four in the competition from his position on the right flank .
" it 's insane , after thrashing argentina 4-0 , i 'm almost lost for words , " mueller told reporters after the match .
" the star today , once again , was the team as a whole . "
mueller , however , will play no part in the semifinal .
the bayern munich man picked up his second yellow card of the competition from a handball call that was more than a bit questionable by the referee , meaning he will serve a one-match ban .
" i hope that my teammates get everything right in the semifnal , then i can come back and score another goal in the final , " the upbeat youngster concluded .
scorer turns provider despite this setback , mueller remained a key man going forward for joachim loew 's men , and displayed fantastic determination and awareness in the build up for germany 's second goal .
even after losing his footing , a seated mueller played a great through-ball for lukas podolski on the left wing , who delivered the perfect cross to miroslav klose in front of goal .
after argentine goalie sergio romero dived for the cross and missed , klose simply had to tap the ball into an open net .
moments later arne friedrich - pushing forward from the center of defense - put the finishing touches on a great cross from bastian schweinsteiger to make it 3-0 germany with just a quarter of an hour to play .

with his second-half brace , the frontman grabbed his 13th and 14th career world cup goals , meaning he is now level with legendary striker gerd mueller as the most prolific german in world cup history .
he only needs one more to tie the overall record of 15 goals , held by the brazilian goal-machine ronaldo .

" even before the game , they 're at it .
the way they gesture , their attempts to influence the referee .
it shows a lack of respect , but that 's just the way the argentines are . "
bastian schweinsteiger , making clear what he thinks of argentina this week .
he also shared his most vivid memory of the game between the two sides at the same quarterfinal stage of the 2006 tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger did n't mince words about argentina " what i remember most is what happened after the game , the brawl which was triggered by the argentinians , " said the germany midfielder .
referring to that fight , captain philipp lahm said he thought its genesis was simple : the argentines " do n't know how to lose . "
the post-match melee meant a suspension for schweinsteiger 's predecessor in germany 's holding midfield role , torsten frings .
the german team went on to lose their next match to italy , and many in germany still feel frings ' absence was decisive in the semi-final defeat .
schweinsteiger said nothing of the kind would happen this time .
" we will not be intimidated or respond to their provocations .
i hope the referee will be watching the game closely , " he said .
returning fire … or holding it ?
having been provoked , the argentina camp wasted little time in firing back - through the ever-passionate carlos tevez .
" i was more afraid of mexico than germany , " tevez told the argentine newspaper clarin .
" the mexicans play better football . "
ouch .
bildunterschrift : just as he was in 2006 , tevez will be a handful for german defenders like arne friedrich other than tevez 's snap , however , the south americans tried to stay low-key .
martin demichelis , who plays in germany for bayern munich , said their recent record against germany does all the talking .
" all the criticisms they make are a sign of respect and nerves .
since we beat them in march , they respect us , " he said .
argentina defeated germany in that recent friendly in munich 1-0 - a score line that flattered the comprehensively beaten hosts .
upon hearing schweinsteiger 's comments , coach diego maradona was even more dismissive .
he said his team " did n't have time to think about schweinsteiger " and ended a television interview by teasing the player .
" what 's the matter with you , schweinsteiger ?
are you getting nervous ? " said the football legend , in a mock-german accent .
switching focus just over 24 hours before the match , however , germany coach joachim loew tried to change the tone of the conversation .
firstly with kindness , as he spoke of his memories of maradona the player he galvanized the whole football world with the way he played .
he was simply magic , " said loew , who never played a starring role on the pitch himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona-fan loew is known for his nose for good football " 1986 and 1990 were the culmination of maradona 's career and he left a mark on football like no other player has ever done before or since . "
he then shared his own thoughts on the post-match fight in 2006 - which he had witnessed as an assistant coach .
" if you ask me , i think that game was at no time brutal or unfair until after the penalties .
it was tightly contested but not marred by unfairness .
the problem in 2006 started after the game had been decided , " said loew .
still , loew said his team would not come out feeling overburdened by the history between the two teams , which includes not just the 2006 brawl but two consecutive world cup finals in 1986 and 1990 , with each side getting the better of the other once .
" we will not be shivering in the changing rooms , hoping the referee wo n't start the game , " said loew .
" in matches like these , " he added , " i do n't really have to help the players with any motivational tricks . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 03.07.2010 online giant amazon enters the grocery business in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon started selling books , but has gone far beyond that amazon has begun selling food , including fresh products , to consumers in germany .
the us company hopes to succeed in a market where numerous german food retailers and internet startups so far have struggled - or failed . consumers in germany can now turn to amazon to purchase not only books , movies and other popular merchandise but also groceries , including fresh fruit , vegetables and meat .
the new online offering covers more than 35,000 products .
most of them are supplied by a network of more than 60 suppliers , including froodies , gourmantis and moevenpick .
same-day delivery delivery for edibles is the same as amazon 's normal service in germany , which is free for purchases above 20 euros .
and , initially in berlin and frankfurt , the company guarantees same-day delivery for orders made before 11 am .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is hoping that convenience will spur people to buy food online amazon has been selling a range of food products in the united states since 2006 , adding perishables like grapes and steaks a couple years ago .
but online food sales have been anything but easy .
prior to the launch of its own online grocery offer , the company made numerous investments in web-to-doorstep grocery delivery ventures in the us during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s .
homegrocer.com , kozo.com and webvan were among them .
all failed , largely due to the need to build up a massive logistical infrastructure .
short distances to stores since then , amazon claims it has learned to work with regional partners to overcome challenges such as sourcing local products and providing an uncomplicated delivery infrastructure .
this regional partnership model is what the company hopes to transplant successfully in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edeka is one of several big german supermarkets to test the waters for online food sales like the us , germany has seen its fair share of online grocers come and go .
" all of the big food retailers in germany , like edeka , real and rewe , have launched online delivery services , then discontinued them only to try again , but so far without huge success , " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert told deutsche welle .
" germany is a country of short distances to stores .
people are simply used to going to stores to buy their groceries . "
online food sales in germany , according to wolfgang adelwarth at market-research company gfk , account for less than 1 percent of the country 's 150-billion-plus grocery market .
trend toward convenience " i see a very limited market for online food sales , " adelwarth told deutsche welle .
" there is a market for speciality products , like wine , and there is a group of young professionals who are too busy too shop in stores , but beyond that i do n't see huge demand in germany . "
still , eggert points to a trend toward convenience among german consumers , both young and old , that could spur online food sales .
but a successful online grocery delivery service in the country , he warns , will not come quickly or cheaply .
" it will take time and money , which amazon has , " eggert said .
" the company clearly sees an opportunity . "

and so it was , but few had predicted what a mismatch that would be . on saturday afternoon , germany delighted its fans - and struck a blow for fans of teamwork everywhere - by leveling an argentina side long on reputation and individual skill but short on ideas .
from start to finish , germany 's tactical discipline was miles ahead of argentina , and their combination play created far more goal-scoring chances .
the 4-0 finish was surprising , but richly deserved too .
argentina 's vaunted danger men - lionel messi , carlos tevez , and gonzalo higuain - never got into gear , seeming to have no answer to germany 's dogged defending , and wary of making a mistake that could touch off a german counter .
" our defensive effort was unbelievable , " said germany coach joachim loew after the match .
" messi , and also higuain and tevez were taken out of the game , and we hardly even fouled them .
we tackled at a very high level - exactly what i like to see . "
to be fair , argentina were put on the back foot early , giving up a soft goal in the third minute .
in a sense , this seemed fated .
bildunterschrift : a schweinsteiger cross , a mueller goal , a whole different ballgame the south americans ' defensive frailties had shown up in prior games in this tournament , as when martin demichelis errors gifted goals to south korea and mexico , but in those cases argentina had been cruising to victory and thus went unpunished for their sloppy play .
this time was different .
nicolas otamendi 's lackadaisical marking allowed thomas mueller to break the ice in a game - a costly error , as it turned out .
argentina did take more possession as the first half went on , but never did much with it , probing around the edge of the penalty area to no avail .
germany 's passing on its frequent counter-attacks , meanwhile , was crisp , purposeful , and foreshadowed the goals that would later flood in .
plan b with the likes of messi and tevez making little headway through the middle and higuain starved of service , argentina turned to the flanks .
many of their offensive moves in the latter stages of the first half were played through angel di maria , who took advantage of the space he found out on the wings .
his crosses , however , were not good enough to break the german defense - and the times his play did test german goalkeeper manuel neuer were when he shot from distance .
argentina 's second half started brightly , with the team 's build-up play becoming more energetic and direct , but germany , in its short bursts of possession , still appeared more dangerous .
so while it was against the run of play in possession terms , germany 's second , pivotal goal in the 68th minute did not come as a surprise .
in a move reminiscent of so many we have seen from germany over the past few weeks , they got forward in numbers and put the ball exactly where it needed to be when it counted .
bildunterschrift : germany 's second goal settled the contest - argentina never looked like scoring again scary good germany are so locked-in at the moment , even thomas mueller 's slipping to the ground in the midst of the attack that led to the goal was not enough to slow it down .
the ball he fed to lukas podolski was all the more sweet in that he delivered it sitting down .

and so it was , but few had predicted what a mismatch that would be . on saturday afternoon , germany delighted its fans - and struck a blow for fans of teamwork everywhere - by leveling an argentina side long on reputation and individual skill but short on ideas .
from start to finish , germany 's tactical discipline was miles ahead of argentina , and their combination play created far more goal-scoring chances .
the 4-0 finish was surprising , but richly deserved too .
argentina 's vaunted danger men - lionel messi , carlos tevez , and gonzalo higuain - never got into gear , seeming to have no answer to germany 's dogged defending , and wary of making a mistake that could touch off a german counter .
" our defensive effort was unbelievable , " said germany coach joachim loew after the match .
" messi , and also higuain and tevez were taken out of the game , and we hardly even fouled them .
we tackled at a very high level - exactly what i like to see . "
to be fair , argentina were put on the back foot early , giving up a soft goal in the third minute .
in a sense , this seemed fated .
bildunterschrift : a schweinsteiger cross , a mueller goal , a whole different ballgame the south americans ' defensive frailties had shown up in prior games in this tournament , as when martin demichelis errors gifted goals to south korea and mexico , but in those cases argentina had been cruising to victory and thus went unpunished for their sloppy play .
this time was different .
nicolas otamendi 's lackadaisical marking allowed thomas mueller to break the ice in a game - a costly error , as it turned out .
argentina did take more possession as the first half went on , but never did much with it , probing around the edge of the penalty area to no avail .
germany 's passing on its frequent counter-attacks , meanwhile , was crisp , purposeful , and foreshadowed the goals that would later flood in .
plan b with the likes of messi and tevez making little headway through the middle and higuain starved of service , argentina turned to the flanks .
many of their offensive moves in the latter stages of the first half were played through angel di maria , who took advantage of the space he found out on the wings .
his crosses , however , were not good enough to break the german defense - and the times his play did test german goalkeeper manuel neuer were when he shot from distance .
argentina 's second half started brightly , with the team 's build-up play becoming more energetic and direct , but germany , in its short bursts of possession , still appeared more dangerous .
so while it was against the run of play in possession terms , germany 's second , pivotal goal in the 68th minute did not come as a surprise .
in a move reminiscent of so many we have seen from germany over the past few weeks , they got forward in numbers and put the ball exactly where it needed to be when it counted .
bildunterschrift : germany 's second goal settled the contest - argentina never looked like scoring again scary good germany are so locked-in at the moment , even thomas mueller 's slipping to the ground in the midst of the attack that led to the goal was not enough to slow it down .
the ball he fed to lukas podolski was all the more sweet in that he delivered it sitting down .
from then on , argentina were broken .
their defense put in nary a challenge to schweinsteiger as he made his run toward goal on germany 's third in the 74th minute , allowing him to lay off to arne friedrich for a tap-in .
and the fourth , a coast-to coast bum-rush involving just four easy passes , showed there was just one team still on the pitch in the game 's penultimate minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona admitted his side had been well beaten argentina coach diego maradona looked shell-shocked after the game .
all the freedom he 'd given his stars to create , all the praise he 'd lavished on them had come to naught against a team with a plan , and the men to execute it .

" our destiny is in our own hands now , we can achieve something really great here . "
bildunterschrift : coach joachim loew , center , had every reason to cheer as his side banged in four goals - again the germans got off to a flying start , scoring the quickest goal of the world cup this year against a shocked argentina backline , with thomas mueller heading home a free-kick in just the third minute .
the 20-year-old mueller , who was a two-goal hero against england in the previous round , has now scored four in the competition from his position on the right flank .
" it 's insane , after thrashing argentina 4-0 , i 'm almost lost for words , " mueller told reporters after the match .
" the star today , once again , was the team as a whole . "
mueller , however , will play no part in the semifinal .
the bayern munich man picked up his second yellow card of the competition from a handball call that was more than a bit questionable by the referee , meaning he will serve a one-match ban .

with his second-half brace , the frontman grabbed his 13th and 14th career world cup goals , meaning he is now level with legendary striker gerd mueller as the most prolific german in world cup history .
he only needs one more to tie the overall record of 15 goals , held by the brazilian goal-machine ronaldo .
schweinsteiger shines holding midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who has excelled while filling the boots of injured german captain michael ballack during the competition , was awarded man of the match for his performance .

schweinsteiger has replaced ballack in style schweinsteiger set up germany 's first and third goals , but his most crucial contribution was controlling the game in the middle of the park from start to finish .
" we may have to play spain next , " the man of the match cautioned after the victory .

he only needs one more to tie the overall record of 15 goals , held by the brazilian goal-machine ronaldo .

schweinsteiger has replaced ballack in style schweinsteiger set up germany 's first and third goals , but his most crucial contribution was controlling the game in the middle of the park from start to finish .

" they 're the best team in the world , in my view .
but we 're good enough , we believe in ourselves . "

the us company hopes to succeed in a market where numerous german food retailers and internet startups so far have struggled - or failed . consumers in germany can now turn to amazon to purchase not only books , movies and other popular merchandise but also groceries , including fresh fruit , vegetables and meat .
the new online offering covers more than 35,000 products .
most of them are supplied by a network of more than 60 suppliers , including froodies , gourmantis and moevenpick .
same-day delivery delivery for edibles is the same as amazon 's normal service in germany , which is free for purchases above 20 euros .
and , initially in berlin and frankfurt , the company guarantees same-day delivery for orders made before 11 am .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is hoping that convenience will spur people to buy food online amazon has been selling a range of food products in the united states since 2006 , adding perishables like grapes and steaks a couple years ago .
but online food sales have been anything but easy .
prior to the launch of its own online grocery offer , the company made numerous investments in web-to-doorstep grocery delivery ventures in the us during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s .
homegrocer.com , kozo.com and webvan were among them .
all failed , largely due to the need to build up a massive logistical infrastructure .
short distances to stores since then , amazon claims it has learned to work with regional partners to overcome challenges such as sourcing local products and providing an uncomplicated delivery infrastructure .
this regional partnership model is what the company hopes to transplant successfully in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edeka is one of several big german supermarkets to test the waters for online food sales like the us , germany has seen its fair share of online grocers come and go .
" all of the big food retailers in germany , like edeka , real and rewe , have launched online delivery services , then discontinued them only to try again , but so far without huge success , " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert told deutsche welle .
" germany is a country of short distances to stores .
people are simply used to going to stores to buy their groceries . "
online food sales in germany , according to wolfgang adelwarth at market-research company gfk , account for less than 1 percent of the country 's 150-billion-plus grocery market .
trend toward convenience " i see a very limited market for online food sales , " adelwarth told deutsche welle .
" there is a market for speciality products , like wine , and there is a group of young professionals who are too busy too shop in stores , but beyond that i do n't see huge demand in germany . "
still , eggert points to a trend toward convenience among german consumers , both young and old , that could spur online food sales .
but a successful online grocery delivery service in the country , he warns , will not come quickly or cheaply .
" it will take time and money , which amazon has , " eggert said .
" the company clearly sees an opportunity . "

the gigantic eurozone rescue plan has succeeded , at least for now , in stabilizing the common european currency .
but capital markets remain skeptical .
the search for a remedy continues . in the eyes of many experts , the euro is still ailing .
but what they do n't know is whether it 's just a cold , which can be treated , or a terminal illness .
no one seems to have the right remedy .
that worries hans-olaf henkel , the former president of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- who also served as managing director of ibm deutschland : he believes the euro has failed and gives germany part of the blame .
" we have not complied with our own guidelines , which certainly would have made the euro a success , " henkel said .
together with the french government , he adds , the german government weakened the stability pact by breaching its criteria – " without an emergency , without a financial or economic crisis , and without a euro crisis . "
' greece isnt 't entirely to blame ' european parliamentarian elmar brok , a member of germany 's christian democratic union party , agrees that greece is n't entirely to blame for the euro mess .
" often the feeling in brussels is that if the big nations need to bend the rules , they change the rules , " brok said .
" but when the smaller nations try to bend the rules , they 're hung out to dry .
we need to make perfectly clear that we germans have a responsibility to restore trust in our own standing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bdi president hans-olaf henkel believes the euro has failed but the german government 's hesitant response to the crisis has shaken trust in the euro .
at the beginning of may , the european union agreed to a 750-billion-euro rescue package for the common currency – in a bid to calm turbulent financial markets .
after grinding its gears , the german government switched into the fast lane and approved 147 billion euros in aid .
andreas schmitz , president of the association of german banks , believes berlin moved too fast , however .
" if the money is already lying in front of you on the table , you grab it , " he said .
" a better idea is to dangle the money and be told that it 's all yours if you 're willing to accept certain conditions . "
european currency watchdogs observers agree the eu will have to live with its own mistakes as it searches for remedies to cure the ailing euro .
the european monetary fund , favored by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , has been sharply criticized by european currency watchdogs .
they fear such a fund would allow debt-ridden nations to pull back on their austerity efforts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts argue for giving the european commission greater economic control another idea making the rounds is the establishment of a european economic government .
france hatched the idea and , until recently , stood alone in its support .
then germany showed interest and , more recently , members of the eu summit in june backed the notion of a common economic policy .
if there is to be an agreement , christian calliess , a european affairs expert at berlin 's free university , expects member states will be willing to give the eu greater economic control rather than responsibility for drafting economic policy .
" i can imagine plenty of control options , like giving greater responsibilities to the european commission and other community bodies to oversee the budgets of member states , " calliess said .
tough action if there is a consensus in the eurozone today , it 's to combat not the symptoms but the causes of the euro 's illness .
that means getting a handle on government debt to halt speculation against the euro .
and that , says calliess , implies taking some tough action .
" in the event of an extreme case like greece , we need to have the possibility of allowing a country to file for insolvency in much the same way a company does in the private sector , " he said .
for sure , this could be a risky operation but it 's one that could prevent the euro from becoming a chronically ill , weak currency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 03.07.2010 germany calls for an end to israel 's gaza blockade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mps say ending the blockade would benefit israel the german parliament has united in denouncing israel 's handling of gaza , calling for an end to the blockade . germany 's government called friday for an immediate end to the blockade of the gaza strip after a unanimous vote in the country 's bundestag parliament condemning israel 's handling of the territory . " we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .
" these children then go to hamas 's koran schools , " she said , adding that the blockade could thus only fuel radical islamism . an end to isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will not apologize for raiding aid ships social democrat mp rolf muetzenich supports mueller 's criticism of the blockade .
muetzenich has called for not only humanitarian aid to gaza , but support to help the region rebuild itself economically and end its political isolation . " we must promote the message among the palestinian fractions that only a government of national unity will allow for an ongoing and just peace solution in palestine - and then be of benefit to israel , " he said . all bundestag fractions agreed that an end to the blockade would indeed benefit israel .
" yet we must not lose sight of israel 's security needs , " said christian democrat philipp missfelder - to the applause of the house . author : bettina marx / dl -lrb- dpa -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 03.07.2010 online giant amazon enters the grocery business in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon started selling books , but has gone far beyond that amazon has begun selling food , including fresh products , to consumers in germany .
the us company hopes to succeed in a market where numerous german food retailers and internet startups so far have struggled - or failed . consumers in germany can now turn to amazon to purchase not only books , movies and other popular merchandise but also groceries , including fresh fruit , vegetables and meat .
the new online offering covers more than 35,000 products .
most of them are supplied by a network of more than 60 suppliers , including froodies , gourmantis and moevenpick .
same-day delivery delivery for edibles is the same as amazon 's normal service in germany , which is free for purchases above 20 euros .
and , initially in berlin and frankfurt , the company guarantees same-day delivery for orders made before 11 am .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is hoping that convenience will spur people to buy food online amazon has been selling a range of food products in the united states since 2006 , adding perishables like grapes and steaks a couple years ago .
but online food sales have been anything but easy .
prior to the launch of its own online grocery offer , the company made numerous investments in web-to-doorstep grocery delivery ventures in the us during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s .
homegrocer.com , kozo.com and webvan were among them .
all failed , largely due to the need to build up a massive logistical infrastructure .
short distances to stores since then , amazon claims it has learned to work with regional partners to overcome challenges such as sourcing local products and providing an uncomplicated delivery infrastructure .
this regional partnership model is what the company hopes to transplant successfully in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edeka is one of several big german supermarkets to test the waters for online food sales like the us , germany has seen its fair share of online grocers come and go .
" all of the big food retailers in germany , like edeka , real and rewe , have launched online delivery services , then discontinued them only to try again , but so far without huge success , " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert told deutsche welle .
" germany is a country of short distances to stores .
people are simply used to going to stores to buy their groceries . "
online food sales in germany , according to wolfgang adelwarth at market-research company gfk , account for less than 1 percent of the country 's 150-billion-plus grocery market .
trend toward convenience " i see a very limited market for online food sales , " adelwarth told deutsche welle .
" there is a market for speciality products , like wine , and there is a group of young professionals who are too busy too shop in stores , but beyond that i do n't see huge demand in germany . "
still , eggert points to a trend toward convenience among german consumers , both young and old , that could spur online food sales .
but a successful online grocery delivery service in the country , he warns , will not come quickly or cheaply .
" it will take time and money , which amazon has , " eggert said .
" the company clearly sees an opportunity . "

the gigantic eurozone rescue plan has succeeded , at least for now , in stabilizing the common european currency .
but capital markets remain skeptical .
the search for a remedy continues . in the eyes of many experts , the euro is still ailing .
but what they do n't know is whether it 's just a cold , which can be treated , or a terminal illness .
no one seems to have the right remedy .
that worries hans-olaf henkel , the former president of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- who also served as managing director of ibm deutschland : he believes the euro has failed and gives germany part of the blame .
" we have not complied with our own guidelines , which certainly would have made the euro a success , " henkel said .
together with the french government , he adds , the german government weakened the stability pact by breaching its criteria – " without an emergency , without a financial or economic crisis , and without a euro crisis . "
' greece isnt 't entirely to blame ' european parliamentarian elmar brok , a member of germany 's christian democratic union party , agrees that greece is n't entirely to blame for the euro mess .
" often the feeling in brussels is that if the big nations need to bend the rules , they change the rules , " brok said .
" but when the smaller nations try to bend the rules , they 're hung out to dry .
we need to make perfectly clear that we germans have a responsibility to restore trust in our own standing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bdi president hans-olaf henkel believes the euro has failed but the german government 's hesitant response to the crisis has shaken trust in the euro .
at the beginning of may , the european union agreed to a 750-billion-euro rescue package for the common currency – in a bid to calm turbulent financial markets .
after grinding its gears , the german government switched into the fast lane and approved 147 billion euros in aid .
andreas schmitz , president of the association of german banks , believes berlin moved too fast , however .
" if the money is already lying in front of you on the table , you grab it , " he said .
" a better idea is to dangle the money and be told that it 's all yours if you 're willing to accept certain conditions . "
european currency watchdogs observers agree the eu will have to live with its own mistakes as it searches for remedies to cure the ailing euro .
the european monetary fund , favored by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , has been sharply criticized by european currency watchdogs .
they fear such a fund would allow debt-ridden nations to pull back on their austerity efforts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts argue for giving the european commission greater economic control another idea making the rounds is the establishment of a european economic government .
france hatched the idea and , until recently , stood alone in its support .
then germany showed interest and , more recently , members of the eu summit in june backed the notion of a common economic policy .
if there is to be an agreement , christian calliess , a european affairs expert at berlin 's free university , expects member states will be willing to give the eu greater economic control rather than responsibility for drafting economic policy .
" i can imagine plenty of control options , like giving greater responsibilities to the european commission and other community bodies to oversee the budgets of member states , " calliess said .
tough action if there is a consensus in the eurozone today , it 's to combat not the symptoms but the causes of the euro 's illness .
that means getting a handle on government debt to halt speculation against the euro .
and that , says calliess , implies taking some tough action .
" in the event of an extreme case like greece , we need to have the possibility of allowing a country to file for insolvency in much the same way a company does in the private sector , " he said .
for sure , this could be a risky operation but it 's one that could prevent the euro from becoming a chronically ill , weak currency .

and so it was , but few had predicted what a mismatch that would be . on saturday afternoon , germany delighted its fans - and struck a blow for fans of teamwork everywhere - by leveling an argentina side long on reputation and individual skill but short on ideas .
from start to finish , germany 's tactical discipline was miles ahead of argentina , and their combination play created far more goal-scoring chances .
the 4-0 finish was surprising , but richly deserved too .
argentina 's vaunted danger men - lionel messi , carlos tevez , and gonzalo higuain - never got into gear , seeming to have no answer to germany 's dogged defending , and wary of making a mistake that could touch off a german counter .
" our defensive effort was unbelievable , " said germany coach joachim loew after the match .
" messi , and also higuain and tevez were taken out of the game , and we hardly even fouled them .
we tackled at a very high level - exactly what i like to see . "
to be fair , argentina were put on the back foot early , giving up a soft goal in the third minute .
in a sense , this seemed fated .
bildunterschrift : a schweinsteiger cross , a mueller goal , a whole different ballgame the south americans ' defensive frailties had shown up in prior games in this tournament , as when martin demichelis errors gifted goals to south korea and mexico , but in those cases argentina had been cruising to victory and thus went unpunished for their sloppy play .
this time was different .
nicolas otamendi 's lackadaisical marking allowed thomas mueller to break the ice in a game - a costly error , as it turned out .
argentina did take more possession as the first half went on , but never did much with it , probing around the edge of the penalty area to no avail .
germany 's passing on its frequent counter-attacks , meanwhile , was crisp , purposeful , and foreshadowed the goals that would later flood in .
plan b with the likes of messi and tevez making little headway through the middle and higuain starved of service , argentina turned to the flanks .
many of their offensive moves in the latter stages of the first half were played through angel di maria , who took advantage of the space he found out on the wings .
his crosses , however , were not good enough to break the german defense - and the times his play did test german goalkeeper manuel neuer were when he shot from distance .
argentina 's second half started brightly , with the team 's build-up play becoming more energetic and direct , but germany , in its short bursts of possession , still appeared more dangerous .
so while it was against the run of play in possession terms , germany 's second , pivotal goal in the 68th minute did not come as a surprise .
in a move reminiscent of so many we have seen from germany over the past few weeks , they got forward in numbers and put the ball exactly where it needed to be when it counted .
bildunterschrift : germany 's second goal settled the contest - argentina never looked like scoring again scary good germany are so locked-in at the moment , even thomas mueller 's slipping to the ground in the midst of the attack that led to the goal was not enough to slow it down .
the ball he fed to lukas podolski was all the more sweet in that he delivered it sitting down .
from then on , argentina were broken .
their defense put in nary a challenge to schweinsteiger as he made his run toward goal on germany 's third in the 74th minute , allowing him to lay off to arne friedrich for a tap-in .
and the fourth , a coast-to coast bum-rush involving just four easy passes , showed there was just one team still on the pitch in the game 's penultimate minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona admitted his side had been well beaten argentina coach diego maradona looked shell-shocked after the game .
all the freedom he 'd given his stars to create , all the praise he 'd lavished on them had come to naught against a team with a plan , and the men to execute it .
" we studied germany well and defined exactly who was playing where but from the first cross they got a goal and suddenly it was a different match , " said maradona .
" they had more ideas and better control of the ball .
they took advantage of the opportunities they had . "
enough said .

" we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .
" these children then go to hamas 's koran schools , " she said , adding that the blockade could thus only fuel radical islamism . an end to isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will not apologize for raiding aid ships social democrat mp rolf muetzenich supports mueller 's criticism of the blockade .
muetzenich has called for not only humanitarian aid to gaza , but support to help the region rebuild itself economically and end its political isolation . " we must promote the message among the palestinian fractions that only a government of national unity will allow for an ongoing and just peace solution in palestine - and then be of benefit to israel , " he said . all bundestag fractions agreed that an end to the blockade would indeed benefit israel .
" yet we must not lose sight of israel 's security needs , " said christian democrat philipp missfelder - to the applause of the house . author : bettina marx / dl -lrb- dpa -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spain will face germany in the semis , after jogi loew 's men thrashed argentina . the match between spain and paraguay was a comparatively stale one , after germany 's up-tempo drubbing of argentina earlier on saturday .
david villa scored for the spaniards late on , but it was a tough route towards the semifinal for his side .
paraguay sat deep , looking to stifle the european champions spain , who played their characteristically composed , but somehow impotent passing game .
spain were confident in possession , sometimes stringing dozens of uninterrupted passes together , but they crafted few real goal scoring opportunities .
for all spain 's possession , paraguay had the ball in the net shortly before half time , with borussia dortmund 's nelson valdez latching on to a long free-kick . the goal was disallowed , perhaps wrongly , in a borderline offside decision .
bildunterschrift : neither side really pulled in the right direction livelier second half in the second half both sides squandered chances from the penalty spot in the space of a few minutes .
paraguay 's oscar cardozo was pulled down in the box , got back up to take the spot-kick himself , but iker casillas made a fairly comfortable save .
in the very next attack david villa won a penalty for spain .
xavi alonso stepped up and scored , but the shot had to be retaken after spanish players rushed into the area before alonso struck .
at the second attempt alonso 's shot was saved in almost the exact same manner as cardozo 's had been moments earlier .
these misses at least provided a necessary spark to the match , and on 82 minutes david villa finally scored the decisive goal for spain , but even then the ball seemed unwilling to cross the goal line .
andres iniesta put pedro clean through , but the substitute 's shot rebounded off the post .
villa was in the right place at the right time , and side-footed the rebound towards goal .
his shot eventually went in , but only after hitting the inside of both posts .
the final few minutes were a frenetic affair , with chances at both ends and spanish defender sergio ramos taking a nasty kick to the face , but in the end the score remained 1-0 spain .
germany watched with interest as victors , spain will go on to face joachim loew 's german side in the semifinals on wednesday .
german midfielder bastian schweinsteiger magnanimously said he believed spain to be the best team in the world , just after his side had staked a claim to that honor with their 4-0 demolition of many people 's tournament favorites argentina .
he did say , however , that germany had what it takes to beat them .
now he will have his chance to find out whether he 's right .

and so it was , but few had predicted what a mismatch that would be . on saturday afternoon , germany delighted its fans - and struck a blow for fans of teamwork everywhere - by leveling an argentina side long on reputation and individual skill but short on ideas .
from start to finish , germany 's tactical discipline was miles ahead of argentina , and their combination play created far more goal-scoring chances .
the 4-0 finish was surprising , but richly deserved too .
argentina 's vaunted danger men - lionel messi , carlos tevez , and gonzalo higuain - never got into gear , seeming to have no answer to germany 's dogged defending , and wary of making a mistake that could touch off a german counter .
" our defensive effort was unbelievable , " said germany coach joachim loew after the match .
" messi , and also higuain and tevez were taken out of the game , and we hardly even fouled them .
we tackled at a very high level - exactly what i like to see . "
to be fair , argentina were put on the back foot early , giving up a soft goal in the third minute .
in a sense , this seemed fated .
bildunterschrift : a schweinsteiger cross , a mueller goal , a whole different ballgame the south americans ' defensive frailties had shown up in prior games in this tournament , as when martin demichelis errors gifted goals to south korea and mexico , but in those cases argentina had been cruising to victory and thus went unpunished for their sloppy play .
this time was different .
nicolas otamendi 's lackadaisical marking allowed thomas mueller to break the ice in a game - a costly error , as it turned out .
argentina did take more possession as the first half went on , but never did much with it , probing around the edge of the penalty area to no avail .
germany 's passing on its frequent counter-attacks , meanwhile , was crisp , purposeful , and foreshadowed the goals that would later flood in .
plan b with the likes of messi and tevez making little headway through the middle and higuain starved of service , argentina turned to the flanks .
many of their offensive moves in the latter stages of the first half were played through angel di maria , who took advantage of the space he found out on the wings .
his crosses , however , were not good enough to break the german defense - and the times his play did test german goalkeeper manuel neuer were when he shot from distance .
argentina 's second half started brightly , with the team 's build-up play becoming more energetic and direct , but germany , in its short bursts of possession , still appeared more dangerous .
so while it was against the run of play in possession terms , germany 's second , pivotal goal in the 68th minute did not come as a surprise .
in a move reminiscent of so many we have seen from germany over the past few weeks , they got forward in numbers and put the ball exactly where it needed to be when it counted .
bildunterschrift : germany 's second goal settled the contest - argentina never looked like scoring again scary good germany are so locked-in at the moment , even thomas mueller 's slipping to the ground in the midst of the attack that led to the goal was not enough to slow it down .
the ball he fed to lukas podolski was all the more sweet in that he delivered it sitting down .
from then on , argentina were broken .
their defense put in nary a challenge to schweinsteiger as he made his run toward goal on germany 's third in the 74th minute , allowing him to lay off to arne friedrich for a tap-in .
and the fourth , a coast-to coast bum-rush involving just four easy passes , showed there was just one team still on the pitch in the game 's penultimate minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona admitted his side had been well beaten argentina coach diego maradona looked shell-shocked after the game .
all the freedom he 'd given his stars to create , all the praise he 'd lavished on them had come to naught against a team with a plan , and the men to execute it .
" we studied germany well and defined exactly who was playing where but from the first cross they got a goal and suddenly it was a different match , " said maradona .
" they had more ideas and better control of the ball .
they took advantage of the opportunities they had . "
enough said .

miroslav klose scored twice , along with goals from thomas mueller and defender arne friedrich . germany have scored four goals for the third time in the world cup , this time dispatching argentina with shocking ease in the quarterfinal .
" now we 're among the best four teams in the world , and that 's exactly where this team belongs , " coach joachim loew said after the game .
" our destiny is in our own hands now , we can achieve something really great here . "
bildunterschrift : coach joachim loew , center , had every reason to cheer as his side banged in four goals - again the germans got off to a flying start , scoring the quickest goal of the world cup this year against a shocked argentina backline , with thomas mueller heading home a free-kick in just the third minute .
the 20-year-old mueller , who was a two-goal hero against england in the previous round , has now scored four in the competition from his position on the right flank .
" it 's insane , after thrashing argentina 4-0 , i 'm almost lost for words , " mueller told reporters after the match .
" the star today , once again , was the team as a whole . "
mueller , however , will play no part in the semifinal .
the bayern munich man picked up his second yellow card of the competition from a handball call that was more than a bit questionable by the referee , meaning he will serve a one-match ban .
" i hope that my teammates get everything right in the semifnal , then i can come back and score another goal in the final , " the upbeat youngster concluded .
scorer turns provider despite this setback , mueller remained a key man going forward for joachim loew 's men , and displayed fantastic determination and awareness in the build up for germany 's second goal .
even after losing his footing , a seated mueller played a great through-ball for lukas podolski on the left wing , who delivered the perfect cross to miroslav klose in front of goal .
after argentine goalie sergio romero dived for the cross and missed , klose simply had to tap the ball into an open net .
moments later arne friedrich - pushing forward from the center of defense - put the finishing touches on a great cross from bastian schweinsteiger to make it 3-0 germany with just a quarter of an hour to play .
closing in on the record bildunterschrift : miroslav klose , left , only needs two more goals to become the world cup 's deadliest ever striker in the dying minutes , with argentina clearly broken , germany made it four , again through miroslav klose .
the veteran 's 100th game for his country could hardly have been scripted better .
with his second-half brace , the frontman grabbed his 13th and 14th career world cup goals , meaning he is now level with legendary striker gerd mueller as the most prolific german in world cup history .
he only needs one more to tie the overall record of 15 goals , held by the brazilian goal-machine ronaldo .
schweinsteiger shines holding midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who has excelled while filling the boots of injured german captain michael ballack during the competition , was awarded man of the match for his performance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael who ?
schweinsteiger has replaced ballack in style schweinsteiger set up germany 's first and third goals , but his most crucial contribution was controlling the game in the middle of the park from start to finish .
" we may have to play spain next , " the man of the match cautioned after the victory .
" they 're the best team in the world , in my view .
but we 're good enough , we believe in ourselves . "
germany will now face either european champions spain or paraguay , who play on saturday evening , in the semifinals .

in front of more than 1,000 cheering onlookers at a packed concert hall in the capital bishkek , otunbayeva somberly took her oath and promised a new political era for crisis-ridden kyrgyzstan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic violence has died down since erupting in april " as president , i will spare no effort to create a new political culture for the country based on a strict adherence to the rule of law , " she told the assembled crowd .
" i must be principled and consistently make demands on all branches of government to ensure it .
the new policy can not be built on fantasies and illusions .
it must be real and effective . "
inauguration comes at delicate moment otunbayeva takes over the government as kyrgyzstan has been wracked by violence and political instability .
thousands have died in ethnic violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks since then-president kurmanbek bakiyev was removed from power in a bloody coup in april .
at least 75,000 people fled to neighboring uzbekistan , leading international aid agencies to warn of an impending humanitarian crisis in dealing with the thousands of families left homeless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of thousands remain homeless in the south the inauguration comes just days after the country overwhelmingly approved a new constitution that will make kyrgyzstan the region 's first parliamentary democracy , a move the government hopes will bring a measure of stability .
the new constitution slashes the powers of the president and sets the stage for parliamentary elections that authorities have scheduled for early october to bring in a permanent government .
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , has questioned the feasibility of kyrgyzstan 's aspirations for a parliamentary democracy , warning that it could lead to further instability in the country and the region .
he said last week on the sidelines of the g20 summit in toronto that a lack of autocratic rule in kyrgyzstan could result in a " relapse into factionalism , " giving rise to a " breeding ground for islamist extremism . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 03.07.2010 germany calls for an end to israel 's gaza blockade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mps say ending the blockade would benefit israel the german parliament has united in denouncing israel 's handling of gaza , calling for an end to the blockade . germany 's government called friday for an immediate end to the blockade of the gaza strip after a unanimous vote in the country 's bundestag parliament condemning israel 's handling of the territory . " we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .

" we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 03.07.2010 ' mechanical doping ' mars start of tour de france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using motorized bikes is said to be the latest form of doping as the 97th tour de france gets underway in rotterdam in the netherlands this saturday , bikes are to be scanned for illegal motors , a practice that has been dubbed mechanical doping . bikes used at the tour de france , which starts in rotterdam this saturday and ends in paris on july 25 , will be scanned for illegal motors , following rumors that swiss rider fabian cancellara used so-called mechanical doping in the tour of flanders and the paris-roubaix .
in a film circulated on the video-sharing website youtube , former tour de france cyclist davide cassani reveals this new form of cheating - riding bikes that are , in fact , motorbikes in disguise .
" these machines have been around since 2004 and they have been used in races by professional cyclists , " cassani told france 's rtl radio .
" there are a lot of benefits using such a bike .
you can reach 50 kilometers an hour .
it has its motor in the frame and a battery between the pedals , " he explains .
suspicious bike swap the italian tv corporation rai has alleged that cancellara swapped bikes suspiciously during the recent paris-roubaix race before going on to victory .
the rider , however , insists the suggestion he used mechanical doping is ridiculous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's fabian cancellara has been linked with mechanical doping but the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- is erring on the side of caution - on june 18 it announced it would tighten its bike checking procedures by introducing a new type of scanner .
" from now on , race service will be subject to stricter regulation in order to ensure that only equipment that has been checked at the start or finish can be used during competitions , " the uci said in a statement .
doping scandals meanwhile , drugs doping is once again casting a shadow over the tour .
italian rider riccardo ricco tested positive three days before the off and doping revelations from former rider floyd landis have implicated seven-time winner lance armstrong , who is taking part in what he says will be his last tour this year .
ricco was handed a two-month suspended jail sentence and a 3,000 euro fine for doping during the 2008 tour de france by a french court on tuesday .
the tour 's organizers insist , however , that it is now harder than ever to cheat .
" considerable progress has been made these past two years , " says christian prudhomme , director of the tour de france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's ricco was handed a suspended sentence for doping during the 2008 tour " now cyclists have to report where they are morning , noon and night every day of the tour .
they also have to carry a biological passport which is designed to root out not only cheats who test positively in traditional tests but those who do n't but whose blood changes its composition suspiciously over time , " he explains .
riders are also subjected to surprise tests before and during the tour .
criticism from the anti-doping agency the french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- , which this year will not be taking part in the drug control process , says that relying on biological passports alone is dangerous .
the afld says additional information from customs authorities and police investigations is needed in the fight against doping .
it also accused the icu of giving preferential treatment to riders such as lance armstrong and last year 's winner alberto contador when it came to surprise testing .
the icu and the afld have a long history of clashes .
in 2009 , they worked together during the tour de france , but the partnership was a failure , according to afld president pierre bordry , who said it would have been impossible to renew the partnership this year .

the gigantic eurozone rescue plan has succeeded , at least for now , in stabilizing the common european currency .
but capital markets remain skeptical .
the search for a remedy continues . in the eyes of many experts , the euro is still ailing .
but what they do n't know is whether it 's just a cold , which can be treated , or a terminal illness .
no one seems to have the right remedy .
that worries hans-olaf henkel , the former president of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- who also served as managing director of ibm deutschland : he believes the euro has failed and gives germany part of the blame .
" we have not complied with our own guidelines , which certainly would have made the euro a success , " henkel said .
together with the french government , he adds , the german government weakened the stability pact by breaching its criteria – " without an emergency , without a financial or economic crisis , and without a euro crisis . "
' greece isnt 't entirely to blame ' european parliamentarian elmar brok , a member of germany 's christian democratic union party , agrees that greece is n't entirely to blame for the euro mess .
" often the feeling in brussels is that if the big nations need to bend the rules , they change the rules , " brok said .
" but when the smaller nations try to bend the rules , they 're hung out to dry .
we need to make perfectly clear that we germans have a responsibility to restore trust in our own standing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bdi president hans-olaf henkel believes the euro has failed but the german government 's hesitant response to the crisis has shaken trust in the euro .
at the beginning of may , the european union agreed to a 750-billion-euro rescue package for the common currency – in a bid to calm turbulent financial markets .
after grinding its gears , the german government switched into the fast lane and approved 147 billion euros in aid .
andreas schmitz , president of the association of german banks , believes berlin moved too fast , however .
" if the money is already lying in front of you on the table , you grab it , " he said .
" a better idea is to dangle the money and be told that it 's all yours if you 're willing to accept certain conditions . "
european currency watchdogs observers agree the eu will have to live with its own mistakes as it searches for remedies to cure the ailing euro .
the european monetary fund , favored by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , has been sharply criticized by european currency watchdogs .
they fear such a fund would allow debt-ridden nations to pull back on their austerity efforts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts argue for giving the european commission greater economic control another idea making the rounds is the establishment of a european economic government .
france hatched the idea and , until recently , stood alone in its support .
then germany showed interest and , more recently , members of the eu summit in june backed the notion of a common economic policy .
if there is to be an agreement , christian calliess , a european affairs expert at berlin 's free university , expects member states will be willing to give the eu greater economic control rather than responsibility for drafting economic policy .
" i can imagine plenty of control options , like giving greater responsibilities to the european commission and other community bodies to oversee the budgets of member states , " calliess said .
tough action if there is a consensus in the eurozone today , it 's to combat not the symptoms but the causes of the euro 's illness .
that means getting a handle on government debt to halt speculation against the euro .
and that , says calliess , implies taking some tough action .
" in the event of an extreme case like greece , we need to have the possibility of allowing a country to file for insolvency in much the same way a company does in the private sector , " he said .
for sure , this could be a risky operation but it 's one that could prevent the euro from becoming a chronically ill , weak currency .

in a film circulated on the video-sharing website youtube , former tour de france cyclist davide cassani reveals this new form of cheating - riding bikes that are , in fact , motorbikes in disguise .
" these machines have been around since 2004 and they have been used in races by professional cyclists , " cassani told france 's rtl radio .
" there are a lot of benefits using such a bike .
you can reach 50 kilometers an hour .
it has its motor in the frame and a battery between the pedals , " he explains .
suspicious bike swap the italian tv corporation rai has alleged that cancellara swapped bikes suspiciously during the recent paris-roubaix race before going on to victory .
the rider , however , insists the suggestion he used mechanical doping is ridiculous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's fabian cancellara has been linked with mechanical doping but the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- is erring on the side of caution - on june 18 it announced it would tighten its bike checking procedures by introducing a new type of scanner .
" from now on , race service will be subject to stricter regulation in order to ensure that only equipment that has been checked at the start or finish can be used during competitions , " the uci said in a statement .
doping scandals meanwhile , drugs doping is once again casting a shadow over the tour .
italian rider riccardo ricco tested positive three days before the off and doping revelations from former rider floyd landis have implicated seven-time winner lance armstrong , who is taking part in what he says will be his last tour this year .
ricco was handed a two-month suspended jail sentence and a 3,000 euro fine for doping during the 2008 tour de france by a french court on tuesday .
the tour 's organizers insist , however , that it is now harder than ever to cheat .
" considerable progress has been made these past two years , " says christian prudhomme , director of the tour de france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's ricco was handed a suspended sentence for doping during the 2008 tour " now cyclists have to report where they are morning , noon and night every day of the tour .
they also have to carry a biological passport which is designed to root out not only cheats who test positively in traditional tests but those who do n't but whose blood changes its composition suspiciously over time , " he explains .
riders are also subjected to surprise tests before and during the tour .
criticism from the anti-doping agency the french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- , which this year will not be taking part in the drug control process , says that relying on biological passports alone is dangerous .
the afld says additional information from customs authorities and police investigations is needed in the fight against doping .
it also accused the icu of giving preferential treatment to riders such as lance armstrong and last year 's winner alberto contador when it came to surprise testing .
the icu and the afld have a long history of clashes .
in 2009 , they worked together during the tour de france , but the partnership was a failure , according to afld president pierre bordry , who said it would have been impossible to renew the partnership this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 03.07.2010 ailing euro needs a cure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the euro become history ?
the gigantic eurozone rescue plan has succeeded , at least for now , in stabilizing the common european currency .
but capital markets remain skeptical .
the search for a remedy continues . in the eyes of many experts , the euro is still ailing .
but what they do n't know is whether it 's just a cold , which can be treated , or a terminal illness .
no one seems to have the right remedy .
that worries hans-olaf henkel , the former president of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- who also served as managing director of ibm deutschland : he believes the euro has failed and gives germany part of the blame .
" we have not complied with our own guidelines , which certainly would have made the euro a success , " henkel said .
together with the french government , he adds , the german government weakened the stability pact by breaching its criteria – " without an emergency , without a financial or economic crisis , and without a euro crisis . "
' greece isnt 't entirely to blame ' european parliamentarian elmar brok , a member of germany 's christian democratic union party , agrees that greece is n't entirely to blame for the euro mess .
" often the feeling in brussels is that if the big nations need to bend the rules , they change the rules , " brok said .
" but when the smaller nations try to bend the rules , they 're hung out to dry .
we need to make perfectly clear that we germans have a responsibility to restore trust in our own standing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bdi president hans-olaf henkel believes the euro has failed but the german government 's hesitant response to the crisis has shaken trust in the euro .
at the beginning of may , the european union agreed to a 750-billion-euro rescue package for the common currency – in a bid to calm turbulent financial markets .
after grinding its gears , the german government switched into the fast lane and approved 147 billion euros in aid .
andreas schmitz , president of the association of german banks , believes berlin moved too fast , however .
" if the money is already lying in front of you on the table , you grab it , " he said .
" a better idea is to dangle the money and be told that it 's all yours if you 're willing to accept certain conditions . "
european currency watchdogs observers agree the eu will have to live with its own mistakes as it searches for remedies to cure the ailing euro .
the european monetary fund , favored by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , has been sharply criticized by european currency watchdogs .
they fear such a fund would allow debt-ridden nations to pull back on their austerity efforts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts argue for giving the european commission greater economic control another idea making the rounds is the establishment of a european economic government .
france hatched the idea and , until recently , stood alone in its support .
then germany showed interest and , more recently , members of the eu summit in june backed the notion of a common economic policy .
if there is to be an agreement , christian calliess , a european affairs expert at berlin 's free university , expects member states will be willing to give the eu greater economic control rather than responsibility for drafting economic policy .
" i can imagine plenty of control options , like giving greater responsibilities to the european commission and other community bodies to oversee the budgets of member states , " calliess said .
tough action if there is a consensus in the eurozone today , it 's to combat not the symptoms but the causes of the euro 's illness .
that means getting a handle on government debt to halt speculation against the euro .
and that , says calliess , implies taking some tough action .
" in the event of an extreme case like greece , we need to have the possibility of allowing a country to file for insolvency in much the same way a company does in the private sector , " he said .
for sure , this could be a risky operation but it 's one that could prevent the euro from becoming a chronically ill , weak currency .

" even before the game , they 're at it .
the way they gesture , their attempts to influence the referee .
it shows a lack of respect , but that 's just the way the argentines are . "
bastian schweinsteiger , making clear what he thinks of argentina this week .
he also shared his most vivid memory of the game between the two sides at the same quarterfinal stage of the 2006 tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger did n't mince words about argentina " what i remember most is what happened after the game , the brawl which was triggered by the argentinians , " said the germany midfielder .
referring to that fight , captain philipp lahm said he thought its genesis was simple : the argentines " do n't know how to lose . "
the post-match melee meant a suspension for schweinsteiger 's predecessor in germany 's holding midfield role , torsten frings .
the german team went on to lose their next match to italy , and many in germany still feel frings ' absence was decisive in the semi-final defeat .
schweinsteiger said nothing of the kind would happen this time .
" we will not be intimidated or respond to their provocations .
i hope the referee will be watching the game closely , " he said .
returning fire … or holding it ?
having been provoked , the argentina camp wasted little time in firing back - through the ever-passionate carlos tevez .
" i was more afraid of mexico than germany , " tevez told the argentine newspaper clarin .
" the mexicans play better football . "
ouch .
bildunterschrift : just as he was in 2006 , tevez will be a handful for german defenders like arne friedrich other than tevez 's snap , however , the south americans tried to stay low-key .
martin demichelis , who plays in germany for bayern munich , said their recent record against germany does all the talking .
" all the criticisms they make are a sign of respect and nerves .
since we beat them in march , they respect us , " he said .
argentina defeated germany in that recent friendly in munich 1-0 - a score line that flattered the comprehensively beaten hosts .
upon hearing schweinsteiger 's comments , coach diego maradona was even more dismissive .
he said his team " did n't have time to think about schweinsteiger " and ended a television interview by teasing the player .
" what 's the matter with you , schweinsteiger ?
are you getting nervous ? " said the football legend , in a mock-german accent .
switching focus just over 24 hours before the match , however , germany coach joachim loew tried to change the tone of the conversation .
firstly with kindness , as he spoke of his memories of maradona the player he galvanized the whole football world with the way he played .
he was simply magic , " said loew , who never played a starring role on the pitch himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona-fan loew is known for his nose for good football " 1986 and 1990 were the culmination of maradona 's career and he left a mark on football like no other player has ever done before or since . "
he then shared his own thoughts on the post-match fight in 2006 - which he had witnessed as an assistant coach .
" if you ask me , i think that game was at no time brutal or unfair until after the penalties .
it was tightly contested but not marred by unfairness .
the problem in 2006 started after the game had been decided , " said loew .
still , loew said his team would not come out feeling overburdened by the history between the two teams , which includes not just the 2006 brawl but two consecutive world cup finals in 1986 and 1990 , with each side getting the better of the other once .
" we will not be shivering in the changing rooms , hoping the referee wo n't start the game , " said loew .
" in matches like these , " he added , " i do n't really have to help the players with any motivational tricks . "

" we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .
" these children then go to hamas 's koran schools , " she said , adding that the blockade could thus only fuel radical islamism . an end to isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will not apologize for raiding aid ships social democrat mp rolf muetzenich supports mueller 's criticism of the blockade .
muetzenich has called for not only humanitarian aid to gaza , but support to help the region rebuild itself economically and end its political isolation . " we must promote the message among the palestinian fractions that only a government of national unity will allow for an ongoing and just peace solution in palestine - and then be of benefit to israel , " he said . all bundestag fractions agreed that an end to the blockade would indeed benefit israel .
" yet we must not lose sight of israel 's security needs , " said christian democrat philipp missfelder - to the applause of the house . author : bettina marx / dl -lrb- dpa -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch world cup -pipe- 03.07.2010 spain finally eke out a win over paraguay , with germany waiting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa 's late goal rescued the spaniards from extra time it took the european champions 82 rather unconvincing minutes , but spain finally managed to put one past a resilient paraguayan defense .
spain will face germany in the semis , after jogi loew 's men thrashed argentina . the match between spain and paraguay was a comparatively stale one , after germany 's up-tempo drubbing of argentina earlier on saturday .
david villa scored for the spaniards late on , but it was a tough route towards the semifinal for his side .
paraguay sat deep , looking to stifle the european champions spain , who played their characteristically composed , but somehow impotent passing game .
spain were confident in possession , sometimes stringing dozens of uninterrupted passes together , but they crafted few real goal scoring opportunities .
for all spain 's possession , paraguay had the ball in the net shortly before half time , with borussia dortmund 's nelson valdez latching on to a long free-kick . the goal was disallowed , perhaps wrongly , in a borderline offside decision .
bildunterschrift : neither side really pulled in the right direction livelier second half in the second half both sides squandered chances from the penalty spot in the space of a few minutes .
paraguay 's oscar cardozo was pulled down in the box , got back up to take the spot-kick himself , but iker casillas made a fairly comfortable save .
in the very next attack david villa won a penalty for spain .
xavi alonso stepped up and scored , but the shot had to be retaken after spanish players rushed into the area before alonso struck .
at the second attempt alonso 's shot was saved in almost the exact same manner as cardozo 's had been moments earlier .
these misses at least provided a necessary spark to the match , and on 82 minutes david villa finally scored the decisive goal for spain , but even then the ball seemed unwilling to cross the goal line .
andres iniesta put pedro clean through , but the substitute 's shot rebounded off the post .
villa was in the right place at the right time , and side-footed the rebound towards goal .
his shot eventually went in , but only after hitting the inside of both posts .
the final few minutes were a frenetic affair , with chances at both ends and spanish defender sergio ramos taking a nasty kick to the face , but in the end the score remained 1-0 spain .
germany watched with interest as victors , spain will go on to face joachim loew 's german side in the semifinals on wednesday .
german midfielder bastian schweinsteiger magnanimously said he believed spain to be the best team in the world , just after his side had staked a claim to that honor with their 4-0 demolition of many people 's tournament favorites argentina .
he did say , however , that germany had what it takes to beat them .
now he will have his chance to find out whether he 's right .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 03.07.2010 ' mechanical doping ' mars start of tour de france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using motorized bikes is said to be the latest form of doping as the 97th tour de france gets underway in rotterdam in the netherlands this saturday , bikes are to be scanned for illegal motors , a practice that has been dubbed mechanical doping . bikes used at the tour de france , which starts in rotterdam this saturday and ends in paris on july 25 , will be scanned for illegal motors , following rumors that swiss rider fabian cancellara used so-called mechanical doping in the tour of flanders and the paris-roubaix .
in a film circulated on the video-sharing website youtube , former tour de france cyclist davide cassani reveals this new form of cheating - riding bikes that are , in fact , motorbikes in disguise .
" these machines have been around since 2004 and they have been used in races by professional cyclists , " cassani told france 's rtl radio .
" there are a lot of benefits using such a bike .
you can reach 50 kilometers an hour .
it has its motor in the frame and a battery between the pedals , " he explains .
suspicious bike swap the italian tv corporation rai has alleged that cancellara swapped bikes suspiciously during the recent paris-roubaix race before going on to victory .
the rider , however , insists the suggestion he used mechanical doping is ridiculous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's fabian cancellara has been linked with mechanical doping but the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- is erring on the side of caution - on june 18 it announced it would tighten its bike checking procedures by introducing a new type of scanner .
" from now on , race service will be subject to stricter regulation in order to ensure that only equipment that has been checked at the start or finish can be used during competitions , " the uci said in a statement .
doping scandals meanwhile , drugs doping is once again casting a shadow over the tour .
italian rider riccardo ricco tested positive three days before the off and doping revelations from former rider floyd landis have implicated seven-time winner lance armstrong , who is taking part in what he says will be his last tour this year .
ricco was handed a two-month suspended jail sentence and a 3,000 euro fine for doping during the 2008 tour de france by a french court on tuesday .
the tour 's organizers insist , however , that it is now harder than ever to cheat .
" considerable progress has been made these past two years , " says christian prudhomme , director of the tour de france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's ricco was handed a suspended sentence for doping during the 2008 tour " now cyclists have to report where they are morning , noon and night every day of the tour .
they also have to carry a biological passport which is designed to root out not only cheats who test positively in traditional tests but those who do n't but whose blood changes its composition suspiciously over time , " he explains .
riders are also subjected to surprise tests before and during the tour .
criticism from the anti-doping agency the french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- , which this year will not be taking part in the drug control process , says that relying on biological passports alone is dangerous .
the afld says additional information from customs authorities and police investigations is needed in the fight against doping .
it also accused the icu of giving preferential treatment to riders such as lance armstrong and last year 's winner alberto contador when it came to surprise testing .
the icu and the afld have a long history of clashes .
in 2009 , they worked together during the tour de france , but the partnership was a failure , according to afld president pierre bordry , who said it would have been impossible to renew the partnership this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 03.07.2010 online giant amazon enters the grocery business in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon started selling books , but has gone far beyond that amazon has begun selling food , including fresh products , to consumers in germany .
the us company hopes to succeed in a market where numerous german food retailers and internet startups so far have struggled - or failed . consumers in germany can now turn to amazon to purchase not only books , movies and other popular merchandise but also groceries , including fresh fruit , vegetables and meat .
the new online offering covers more than 35,000 products .
most of them are supplied by a network of more than 60 suppliers , including froodies , gourmantis and moevenpick .
same-day delivery delivery for edibles is the same as amazon 's normal service in germany , which is free for purchases above 20 euros .
and , initially in berlin and frankfurt , the company guarantees same-day delivery for orders made before 11 am .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is hoping that convenience will spur people to buy food online amazon has been selling a range of food products in the united states since 2006 , adding perishables like grapes and steaks a couple years ago .
but online food sales have been anything but easy .
prior to the launch of its own online grocery offer , the company made numerous investments in web-to-doorstep grocery delivery ventures in the us during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s .
homegrocer.com , kozo.com and webvan were among them .
all failed , largely due to the need to build up a massive logistical infrastructure .
short distances to stores since then , amazon claims it has learned to work with regional partners to overcome challenges such as sourcing local products and providing an uncomplicated delivery infrastructure .
this regional partnership model is what the company hopes to transplant successfully in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edeka is one of several big german supermarkets to test the waters for online food sales like the us , germany has seen its fair share of online grocers come and go .
" all of the big food retailers in germany , like edeka , real and rewe , have launched online delivery services , then discontinued them only to try again , but so far without huge success , " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert told deutsche welle .
" germany is a country of short distances to stores .
people are simply used to going to stores to buy their groceries . "
online food sales in germany , according to wolfgang adelwarth at market-research company gfk , account for less than 1 percent of the country 's 150-billion-plus grocery market .
trend toward convenience " i see a very limited market for online food sales , " adelwarth told deutsche welle .
" there is a market for speciality products , like wine , and there is a group of young professionals who are too busy too shop in stores , but beyond that i do n't see huge demand in germany . "
still , eggert points to a trend toward convenience among german consumers , both young and old , that could spur online food sales .
but a successful online grocery delivery service in the country , he warns , will not come quickly or cheaply .
" it will take time and money , which amazon has , " eggert said .
" the company clearly sees an opportunity . "

" i must be principled and consistently make demands on all branches of government to ensure it .
the new policy can not be built on fantasies and illusions .
it must be real and effective . "
inauguration comes at delicate moment otunbayeva takes over the government as kyrgyzstan has been wracked by violence and political instability .
thousands have died in ethnic violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks since then-president kurmanbek bakiyev was removed from power in a bloody coup in april .
at least 75,000 people fled to neighboring uzbekistan , leading international aid agencies to warn of an impending humanitarian crisis in dealing with the thousands of families left homeless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of thousands remain homeless in the south the inauguration comes just days after the country overwhelmingly approved a new constitution that will make kyrgyzstan the region 's first parliamentary democracy , a move the government hopes will bring a measure of stability .
the new constitution slashes the powers of the president and sets the stage for parliamentary elections that authorities have scheduled for early october to bring in a permanent government .
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , has questioned the feasibility of kyrgyzstan 's aspirations for a parliamentary democracy , warning that it could lead to further instability in the country and the region .
he said last week on the sidelines of the g20 summit in toronto that a lack of autocratic rule in kyrgyzstan could result in a " relapse into factionalism , " giving rise to a " breeding ground for islamist extremism . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of thousands remain homeless in the south the inauguration comes just days after the country overwhelmingly approved a new constitution that will make kyrgyzstan the region 's first parliamentary democracy , a move the government hopes will bring a measure of stability .
the new constitution slashes the powers of the president and sets the stage for parliamentary elections that authorities have scheduled for early october to bring in a permanent government .
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , has questioned the feasibility of kyrgyzstan 's aspirations for a parliamentary democracy , warning that it could lead to further instability in the country and the region .
he said last week on the sidelines of the g20 summit in toronto that a lack of autocratic rule in kyrgyzstan could result in a " relapse into factionalism , " giving rise to a " breeding ground for islamist extremism . "

the gigantic eurozone rescue plan has succeeded , at least for now , in stabilizing the common european currency .
but capital markets remain skeptical .
the search for a remedy continues . in the eyes of many experts , the euro is still ailing .
but what they do n't know is whether it 's just a cold , which can be treated , or a terminal illness .
no one seems to have the right remedy .
that worries hans-olaf henkel , the former president of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- who also served as managing director of ibm deutschland : he believes the euro has failed and gives germany part of the blame .
" we have not complied with our own guidelines , which certainly would have made the euro a success , " henkel said .
together with the french government , he adds , the german government weakened the stability pact by breaching its criteria – " without an emergency , without a financial or economic crisis , and without a euro crisis . "
' greece isnt 't entirely to blame ' european parliamentarian elmar brok , a member of germany 's christian democratic union party , agrees that greece is n't entirely to blame for the euro mess .
" often the feeling in brussels is that if the big nations need to bend the rules , they change the rules , " brok said .
" but when the smaller nations try to bend the rules , they 're hung out to dry .
we need to make perfectly clear that we germans have a responsibility to restore trust in our own standing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bdi president hans-olaf henkel believes the euro has failed but the german government 's hesitant response to the crisis has shaken trust in the euro .
at the beginning of may , the european union agreed to a 750-billion-euro rescue package for the common currency – in a bid to calm turbulent financial markets .
after grinding its gears , the german government switched into the fast lane and approved 147 billion euros in aid .
andreas schmitz , president of the association of german banks , believes berlin moved too fast , however .
" if the money is already lying in front of you on the table , you grab it , " he said .
" a better idea is to dangle the money and be told that it 's all yours if you 're willing to accept certain conditions . "
european currency watchdogs observers agree the eu will have to live with its own mistakes as it searches for remedies to cure the ailing euro .
the european monetary fund , favored by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , has been sharply criticized by european currency watchdogs .
they fear such a fund would allow debt-ridden nations to pull back on their austerity efforts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts argue for giving the european commission greater economic control another idea making the rounds is the establishment of a european economic government .
france hatched the idea and , until recently , stood alone in its support .
then germany showed interest and , more recently , members of the eu summit in june backed the notion of a common economic policy .
if there is to be an agreement , christian calliess , a european affairs expert at berlin 's free university , expects member states will be willing to give the eu greater economic control rather than responsibility for drafting economic policy .
" i can imagine plenty of control options , like giving greater responsibilities to the european commission and other community bodies to oversee the budgets of member states , " calliess said .
tough action if there is a consensus in the eurozone today , it 's to combat not the symptoms but the causes of the euro 's illness .
that means getting a handle on government debt to halt speculation against the euro .
and that , says calliess , implies taking some tough action .
" in the event of an extreme case like greece , we need to have the possibility of allowing a country to file for insolvency in much the same way a company does in the private sector , " he said .
for sure , this could be a risky operation but it 's one that could prevent the euro from becoming a chronically ill , weak currency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 03.07.2010 ' mechanical doping ' mars start of tour de france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using motorized bikes is said to be the latest form of doping as the 97th tour de france gets underway in rotterdam in the netherlands this saturday , bikes are to be scanned for illegal motors , a practice that has been dubbed mechanical doping . bikes used at the tour de france , which starts in rotterdam this saturday and ends in paris on july 25 , will be scanned for illegal motors , following rumors that swiss rider fabian cancellara used so-called mechanical doping in the tour of flanders and the paris-roubaix .
in a film circulated on the video-sharing website youtube , former tour de france cyclist davide cassani reveals this new form of cheating - riding bikes that are , in fact , motorbikes in disguise .
" these machines have been around since 2004 and they have been used in races by professional cyclists , " cassani told france 's rtl radio .
" there are a lot of benefits using such a bike .
you can reach 50 kilometers an hour .
it has its motor in the frame and a battery between the pedals , " he explains .
suspicious bike swap the italian tv corporation rai has alleged that cancellara swapped bikes suspiciously during the recent paris-roubaix race before going on to victory .
the rider , however , insists the suggestion he used mechanical doping is ridiculous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's fabian cancellara has been linked with mechanical doping but the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- is erring on the side of caution - on june 18 it announced it would tighten its bike checking procedures by introducing a new type of scanner .
" from now on , race service will be subject to stricter regulation in order to ensure that only equipment that has been checked at the start or finish can be used during competitions , " the uci said in a statement .
doping scandals meanwhile , drugs doping is once again casting a shadow over the tour .
italian rider riccardo ricco tested positive three days before the off and doping revelations from former rider floyd landis have implicated seven-time winner lance armstrong , who is taking part in what he says will be his last tour this year .
ricco was handed a two-month suspended jail sentence and a 3,000 euro fine for doping during the 2008 tour de france by a french court on tuesday .
the tour 's organizers insist , however , that it is now harder than ever to cheat .
" considerable progress has been made these past two years , " says christian prudhomme , director of the tour de france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's ricco was handed a suspended sentence for doping during the 2008 tour " now cyclists have to report where they are morning , noon and night every day of the tour .
they also have to carry a biological passport which is designed to root out not only cheats who test positively in traditional tests but those who do n't but whose blood changes its composition suspiciously over time , " he explains .
riders are also subjected to surprise tests before and during the tour .
criticism from the anti-doping agency the french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- , which this year will not be taking part in the drug control process , says that relying on biological passports alone is dangerous .
the afld says additional information from customs authorities and police investigations is needed in the fight against doping .
it also accused the icu of giving preferential treatment to riders such as lance armstrong and last year 's winner alberto contador when it came to surprise testing .
the icu and the afld have a long history of clashes .
in 2009 , they worked together during the tour de france , but the partnership was a failure , according to afld president pierre bordry , who said it would have been impossible to renew the partnership this year .

spain will face germany in the semis , after jogi loew 's men thrashed argentina . the match between spain and paraguay was a comparatively stale one , after germany 's up-tempo drubbing of argentina earlier on saturday .
david villa scored for the spaniards late on , but it was a tough route towards the semifinal for his side .
paraguay sat deep , looking to stifle the european champions spain , who played their characteristically composed , but somehow impotent passing game .
spain were confident in possession , sometimes stringing dozens of uninterrupted passes together , but they crafted few real goal scoring opportunities .
for all spain 's possession , paraguay had the ball in the net shortly before half time , with borussia dortmund 's nelson valdez latching on to a long free-kick . the goal was disallowed , perhaps wrongly , in a borderline offside decision .
bildunterschrift : neither side really pulled in the right direction livelier second half in the second half both sides squandered chances from the penalty spot in the space of a few minutes .
paraguay 's oscar cardozo was pulled down in the box , got back up to take the spot-kick himself , but iker casillas made a fairly comfortable save .
in the very next attack david villa won a penalty for spain .
xavi alonso stepped up and scored , but the shot had to be retaken after spanish players rushed into the area before alonso struck .
at the second attempt alonso 's shot was saved in almost the exact same manner as cardozo 's had been moments earlier .
these misses at least provided a necessary spark to the match , and on 82 minutes david villa finally scored the decisive goal for spain , but even then the ball seemed unwilling to cross the goal line .
andres iniesta put pedro clean through , but the substitute 's shot rebounded off the post .
villa was in the right place at the right time , and side-footed the rebound towards goal .
his shot eventually went in , but only after hitting the inside of both posts .
the final few minutes were a frenetic affair , with chances at both ends and spanish defender sergio ramos taking a nasty kick to the face , but in the end the score remained 1-0 spain .
germany watched with interest as victors , spain will go on to face joachim loew 's german side in the semifinals on wednesday .
german midfielder bastian schweinsteiger magnanimously said he believed spain to be the best team in the world , just after his side had staked a claim to that honor with their 4-0 demolition of many people 's tournament favorites argentina .
he did say , however , that germany had what it takes to beat them .
now he will have his chance to find out whether he 's right .

miroslav klose scored twice , along with goals from thomas mueller and defender arne friedrich . germany have scored four goals for the third time in the world cup , this time dispatching argentina with shocking ease in the quarterfinal .
" now we 're among the best four teams in the world , and that 's exactly where this team belongs , " coach joachim loew said after the game .
" our destiny is in our own hands now , we can achieve something really great here . "
bildunterschrift : coach joachim loew , center , had every reason to cheer as his side banged in four goals - again the germans got off to a flying start , scoring the quickest goal of the world cup this year against a shocked argentina backline , with thomas mueller heading home a free-kick in just the third minute .
the 20-year-old mueller , who was a two-goal hero against england in the previous round , has now scored four in the competition from his position on the right flank .
" it 's insane , after thrashing argentina 4-0 , i 'm almost lost for words , " mueller told reporters after the match .
" the star today , once again , was the team as a whole . "
mueller , however , will play no part in the semifinal .
the bayern munich man picked up his second yellow card of the competition from a handball call that was more than a bit questionable by the referee , meaning he will serve a one-match ban .
" i hope that my teammates get everything right in the semifnal , then i can come back and score another goal in the final , " the upbeat youngster concluded .
scorer turns provider despite this setback , mueller remained a key man going forward for joachim loew 's men , and displayed fantastic determination and awareness in the build up for germany 's second goal .
even after losing his footing , a seated mueller played a great through-ball for lukas podolski on the left wing , who delivered the perfect cross to miroslav klose in front of goal .
after argentine goalie sergio romero dived for the cross and missed , klose simply had to tap the ball into an open net .
moments later arne friedrich - pushing forward from the center of defense - put the finishing touches on a great cross from bastian schweinsteiger to make it 3-0 germany with just a quarter of an hour to play .
closing in on the record bildunterschrift : miroslav klose , left , only needs two more goals to become the world cup 's deadliest ever striker in the dying minutes , with argentina clearly broken , germany made it four , again through miroslav klose .
the veteran 's 100th game for his country could hardly have been scripted better .
with his second-half brace , the frontman grabbed his 13th and 14th career world cup goals , meaning he is now level with legendary striker gerd mueller as the most prolific german in world cup history .
he only needs one more to tie the overall record of 15 goals , held by the brazilian goal-machine ronaldo .
schweinsteiger shines holding midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who has excelled while filling the boots of injured german captain michael ballack during the competition , was awarded man of the match for his performance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael who ?
schweinsteiger has replaced ballack in style schweinsteiger set up germany 's first and third goals , but his most crucial contribution was controlling the game in the middle of the park from start to finish .
" we may have to play spain next , " the man of the match cautioned after the victory .
" they 're the best team in the world , in my view .
but we 're good enough , we believe in ourselves . "
germany will now face either european champions spain or paraguay , who play on saturday evening , in the semifinals .

" our destiny is in our own hands now , we can achieve something really great here . "
bildunterschrift : coach joachim loew , center , had every reason to cheer as his side banged in four goals - again the germans got off to a flying start , scoring the quickest goal of the world cup this year against a shocked argentina backline , with thomas mueller heading home a free-kick in just the third minute .
the 20-year-old mueller , who was a two-goal hero against england in the previous round , has now scored four in the competition from his position on the right flank .
" it 's insane , after thrashing argentina 4-0 , i 'm almost lost for words , " mueller told reporters after the match .
" the star today , once again , was the team as a whole . "
mueller , however , will play no part in the semifinal .
the bayern munich man picked up his second yellow card of the competition from a handball call that was more than a bit questionable by the referee , meaning he will serve a one-match ban .
" i hope that my teammates get everything right in the semifnal , then i can come back and score another goal in the final , " the upbeat youngster concluded .
scorer turns provider despite this setback , mueller remained a key man going forward for joachim loew 's men , and displayed fantastic determination and awareness in the build up for germany 's second goal .
even after losing his footing , a seated mueller played a great through-ball for lukas podolski on the left wing , who delivered the perfect cross to miroslav klose in front of goal .
after argentine goalie sergio romero dived for the cross and missed , klose simply had to tap the ball into an open net .
moments later arne friedrich - pushing forward from the center of defense - put the finishing touches on a great cross from bastian schweinsteiger to make it 3-0 germany with just a quarter of an hour to play .
closing in on the record bildunterschrift : miroslav klose , left , only needs two more goals to become the world cup 's deadliest ever striker in the dying minutes , with argentina clearly broken , germany made it four , again through miroslav klose .
the veteran 's 100th game for his country could hardly have been scripted better .
with his second-half brace , the frontman grabbed his 13th and 14th career world cup goals , meaning he is now level with legendary striker gerd mueller as the most prolific german in world cup history .
he only needs one more to tie the overall record of 15 goals , held by the brazilian goal-machine ronaldo .
schweinsteiger shines holding midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who has excelled while filling the boots of injured german captain michael ballack during the competition , was awarded man of the match for his performance .

schweinsteiger has replaced ballack in style schweinsteiger set up germany 's first and third goals , but his most crucial contribution was controlling the game in the middle of the park from start to finish .
" we may have to play spain next , " the man of the match cautioned after the victory .
" they 're the best team in the world , in my view .
but we 're good enough , we believe in ourselves . "
germany will now face either european champions spain or paraguay , who play on saturday evening , in the semifinals .

" even before the game , they 're at it .
the way they gesture , their attempts to influence the referee .
it shows a lack of respect , but that 's just the way the argentines are . "
bastian schweinsteiger , making clear what he thinks of argentina this week .
he also shared his most vivid memory of the game between the two sides at the same quarterfinal stage of the 2006 tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger did n't mince words about argentina " what i remember most is what happened after the game , the brawl which was triggered by the argentinians , " said the germany midfielder .
referring to that fight , captain philipp lahm said he thought its genesis was simple : the argentines " do n't know how to lose . "
the post-match melee meant a suspension for schweinsteiger 's predecessor in germany 's holding midfield role , torsten frings .
the german team went on to lose their next match to italy , and many in germany still feel frings ' absence was decisive in the semi-final defeat .
schweinsteiger said nothing of the kind would happen this time .
" we will not be intimidated or respond to their provocations .
i hope the referee will be watching the game closely , " he said .
returning fire … or holding it ?
having been provoked , the argentina camp wasted little time in firing back - through the ever-passionate carlos tevez .
" i was more afraid of mexico than germany , " tevez told the argentine newspaper clarin .
" the mexicans play better football . "
ouch .
bildunterschrift : just as he was in 2006 , tevez will be a handful for german defenders like arne friedrich other than tevez 's snap , however , the south americans tried to stay low-key .
martin demichelis , who plays in germany for bayern munich , said their recent record against germany does all the talking .
" all the criticisms they make are a sign of respect and nerves .
since we beat them in march , they respect us , " he said .
argentina defeated germany in that recent friendly in munich 1-0 - a score line that flattered the comprehensively beaten hosts .
upon hearing schweinsteiger 's comments , coach diego maradona was even more dismissive .
he said his team " did n't have time to think about schweinsteiger " and ended a television interview by teasing the player .
" what 's the matter with you , schweinsteiger ?
are you getting nervous ? " said the football legend , in a mock-german accent .
switching focus just over 24 hours before the match , however , germany coach joachim loew tried to change the tone of the conversation .
firstly with kindness , as he spoke of his memories of maradona the player he galvanized the whole football world with the way he played .
he was simply magic , " said loew , who never played a starring role on the pitch himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona-fan loew is known for his nose for good football " 1986 and 1990 were the culmination of maradona 's career and he left a mark on football like no other player has ever done before or since . "
he then shared his own thoughts on the post-match fight in 2006 - which he had witnessed as an assistant coach .
" if you ask me , i think that game was at no time brutal or unfair until after the penalties .
it was tightly contested but not marred by unfairness .
the problem in 2006 started after the game had been decided , " said loew .
still , loew said his team would not come out feeling overburdened by the history between the two teams , which includes not just the 2006 brawl but two consecutive world cup finals in 1986 and 1990 , with each side getting the better of the other once .
" we will not be shivering in the changing rooms , hoping the referee wo n't start the game , " said loew .
" in matches like these , " he added , " i do n't really have to help the players with any motivational tricks . "

spain will face germany in the semis , after jogi loew 's men thrashed argentina . the match between spain and paraguay was a comparatively stale one , after germany 's up-tempo drubbing of argentina earlier on saturday .
david villa scored for the spaniards late on , but it was a tough route towards the semifinal for his side .
paraguay sat deep , looking to stifle the european champions spain , who played their characteristically composed , but somehow impotent passing game .
spain were confident in possession , sometimes stringing dozens of uninterrupted passes together , but they crafted few real goal scoring opportunities .
for all spain 's possession , paraguay had the ball in the net shortly before half time , with borussia dortmund 's nelson valdez latching on to a long free-kick . the goal was disallowed , perhaps wrongly , in a borderline offside decision .
bildunterschrift : neither side really pulled in the right direction livelier second half in the second half both sides squandered chances from the penalty spot in the space of a few minutes .
paraguay 's oscar cardozo was pulled down in the box , got back up to take the spot-kick himself , but iker casillas made a fairly comfortable save .
in the very next attack david villa won a penalty for spain .
xavi alonso stepped up and scored , but the shot had to be retaken after spanish players rushed into the area before alonso struck .
at the second attempt alonso 's shot was saved in almost the exact same manner as cardozo 's had been moments earlier .
these misses at least provided a necessary spark to the match , and on 82 minutes david villa finally scored the decisive goal for spain , but even then the ball seemed unwilling to cross the goal line .
andres iniesta put pedro clean through , but the substitute 's shot rebounded off the post .
villa was in the right place at the right time , and side-footed the rebound towards goal .
his shot eventually went in , but only after hitting the inside of both posts .
the final few minutes were a frenetic affair , with chances at both ends and spanish defender sergio ramos taking a nasty kick to the face , but in the end the score remained 1-0 spain .
germany watched with interest as victors , spain will go on to face joachim loew 's german side in the semifinals on wednesday .
german midfielder bastian schweinsteiger magnanimously said he believed spain to be the best team in the world , just after his side had staked a claim to that honor with their 4-0 demolition of many people 's tournament favorites argentina .
he did say , however , that germany had what it takes to beat them .

in front of more than 1,000 cheering onlookers at a packed concert hall in the capital bishkek , otunbayeva somberly took her oath and promised a new political era for crisis-ridden kyrgyzstan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic violence has died down since erupting in april " as president , i will spare no effort to create a new political culture for the country based on a strict adherence to the rule of law , " she told the assembled crowd .
" i must be principled and consistently make demands on all branches of government to ensure it .
the new policy can not be built on fantasies and illusions .
it must be real and effective . "
inauguration comes at delicate moment otunbayeva takes over the government as kyrgyzstan has been wracked by violence and political instability .
thousands have died in ethnic violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks since then-president kurmanbek bakiyev was removed from power in a bloody coup in april .
at least 75,000 people fled to neighboring uzbekistan , leading international aid agencies to warn of an impending humanitarian crisis in dealing with the thousands of families left homeless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of thousands remain homeless in the south the inauguration comes just days after the country overwhelmingly approved a new constitution that will make kyrgyzstan the region 's first parliamentary democracy , a move the government hopes will bring a measure of stability .
the new constitution slashes the powers of the president and sets the stage for parliamentary elections that authorities have scheduled for early october to bring in a permanent government .
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , has questioned the feasibility of kyrgyzstan 's aspirations for a parliamentary democracy , warning that it could lead to further instability in the country and the region .
he said last week on the sidelines of the g20 summit in toronto that a lack of autocratic rule in kyrgyzstan could result in a " relapse into factionalism , " giving rise to a " breeding ground for islamist extremism . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 03.07.2010 ailing euro needs a cure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the euro become history ?
the gigantic eurozone rescue plan has succeeded , at least for now , in stabilizing the common european currency .
but capital markets remain skeptical .
the search for a remedy continues . in the eyes of many experts , the euro is still ailing .
but what they do n't know is whether it 's just a cold , which can be treated , or a terminal illness .
no one seems to have the right remedy .
that worries hans-olaf henkel , the former president of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- who also served as managing director of ibm deutschland : he believes the euro has failed and gives germany part of the blame .
" we have not complied with our own guidelines , which certainly would have made the euro a success , " henkel said .
together with the french government , he adds , the german government weakened the stability pact by breaching its criteria – " without an emergency , without a financial or economic crisis , and without a euro crisis . "
' greece isnt 't entirely to blame ' european parliamentarian elmar brok , a member of germany 's christian democratic union party , agrees that greece is n't entirely to blame for the euro mess .
" often the feeling in brussels is that if the big nations need to bend the rules , they change the rules , " brok said .
" but when the smaller nations try to bend the rules , they 're hung out to dry .
we need to make perfectly clear that we germans have a responsibility to restore trust in our own standing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bdi president hans-olaf henkel believes the euro has failed but the german government 's hesitant response to the crisis has shaken trust in the euro .
at the beginning of may , the european union agreed to a 750-billion-euro rescue package for the common currency – in a bid to calm turbulent financial markets .
after grinding its gears , the german government switched into the fast lane and approved 147 billion euros in aid .
andreas schmitz , president of the association of german banks , believes berlin moved too fast , however .
" if the money is already lying in front of you on the table , you grab it , " he said .
" a better idea is to dangle the money and be told that it 's all yours if you 're willing to accept certain conditions . "
european currency watchdogs observers agree the eu will have to live with its own mistakes as it searches for remedies to cure the ailing euro .
the european monetary fund , favored by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , has been sharply criticized by european currency watchdogs .
they fear such a fund would allow debt-ridden nations to pull back on their austerity efforts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts argue for giving the european commission greater economic control another idea making the rounds is the establishment of a european economic government .
france hatched the idea and , until recently , stood alone in its support .
then germany showed interest and , more recently , members of the eu summit in june backed the notion of a common economic policy .
if there is to be an agreement , christian calliess , a european affairs expert at berlin 's free university , expects member states will be willing to give the eu greater economic control rather than responsibility for drafting economic policy .
" i can imagine plenty of control options , like giving greater responsibilities to the european commission and other community bodies to oversee the budgets of member states , " calliess said .
tough action if there is a consensus in the eurozone today , it 's to combat not the symptoms but the causes of the euro 's illness .
that means getting a handle on government debt to halt speculation against the euro .
and that , says calliess , implies taking some tough action .
" in the event of an extreme case like greece , we need to have the possibility of allowing a country to file for insolvency in much the same way a company does in the private sector , " he said .
for sure , this could be a risky operation but it 's one that could prevent the euro from becoming a chronically ill , weak currency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 03.07.2010 online giant amazon enters the grocery business in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon started selling books , but has gone far beyond that amazon has begun selling food , including fresh products , to consumers in germany .
the us company hopes to succeed in a market where numerous german food retailers and internet startups so far have struggled - or failed . consumers in germany can now turn to amazon to purchase not only books , movies and other popular merchandise but also groceries , including fresh fruit , vegetables and meat .
the new online offering covers more than 35,000 products .
most of them are supplied by a network of more than 60 suppliers , including froodies , gourmantis and moevenpick .
same-day delivery delivery for edibles is the same as amazon 's normal service in germany , which is free for purchases above 20 euros .
and , initially in berlin and frankfurt , the company guarantees same-day delivery for orders made before 11 am .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is hoping that convenience will spur people to buy food online amazon has been selling a range of food products in the united states since 2006 , adding perishables like grapes and steaks a couple years ago .
but online food sales have been anything but easy .
prior to the launch of its own online grocery offer , the company made numerous investments in web-to-doorstep grocery delivery ventures in the us during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s .
homegrocer.com , kozo.com and webvan were among them .
all failed , largely due to the need to build up a massive logistical infrastructure .
short distances to stores since then , amazon claims it has learned to work with regional partners to overcome challenges such as sourcing local products and providing an uncomplicated delivery infrastructure .
this regional partnership model is what the company hopes to transplant successfully in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edeka is one of several big german supermarkets to test the waters for online food sales like the us , germany has seen its fair share of online grocers come and go .
" all of the big food retailers in germany , like edeka , real and rewe , have launched online delivery services , then discontinued them only to try again , but so far without huge success , " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert told deutsche welle .
" germany is a country of short distances to stores .
people are simply used to going to stores to buy their groceries . "
online food sales in germany , according to wolfgang adelwarth at market-research company gfk , account for less than 1 percent of the country 's 150-billion-plus grocery market .
trend toward convenience " i see a very limited market for online food sales , " adelwarth told deutsche welle .
" there is a market for speciality products , like wine , and there is a group of young professionals who are too busy too shop in stores , but beyond that i do n't see huge demand in germany . "
still , eggert points to a trend toward convenience among german consumers , both young and old , that could spur online food sales .
but a successful online grocery delivery service in the country , he warns , will not come quickly or cheaply .
" it will take time and money , which amazon has , " eggert said .
" the company clearly sees an opportunity . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 03.07.2010 germany calls for an end to israel 's gaza blockade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mps say ending the blockade would benefit israel the german parliament has united in denouncing israel 's handling of gaza , calling for an end to the blockade . germany 's government called friday for an immediate end to the blockade of the gaza strip after a unanimous vote in the country 's bundestag parliament condemning israel 's handling of the territory . " we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .
" these children then go to hamas 's koran schools , " she said , adding that the blockade could thus only fuel radical islamism . an end to isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will not apologize for raiding aid ships social democrat mp rolf muetzenich supports mueller 's criticism of the blockade .
muetzenich has called for not only humanitarian aid to gaza , but support to help the region rebuild itself economically and end its political isolation . " we must promote the message among the palestinian fractions that only a government of national unity will allow for an ongoing and just peace solution in palestine - and then be of benefit to israel , " he said . all bundestag fractions agreed that an end to the blockade would indeed benefit israel .
" yet we must not lose sight of israel 's security needs , " said christian democrat philipp missfelder - to the applause of the house . author : bettina marx / dl -lrb- dpa -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and so it was , but few had predicted what a mismatch that would be . on saturday afternoon , germany delighted its fans - and struck a blow for fans of teamwork everywhere - by leveling an argentina side long on reputation and individual skill but short on ideas .
from start to finish , germany 's tactical discipline was miles ahead of argentina , and their combination play created far more goal-scoring chances .
the 4-0 finish was surprising , but richly deserved too .
argentina 's vaunted danger men - lionel messi , carlos tevez , and gonzalo higuain - never got into gear , seeming to have no answer to germany 's dogged defending , and wary of making a mistake that could touch off a german counter .
" our defensive effort was unbelievable , " said germany coach joachim loew after the match .
" messi , and also higuain and tevez were taken out of the game , and we hardly even fouled them .
we tackled at a very high level - exactly what i like to see . "
to be fair , argentina were put on the back foot early , giving up a soft goal in the third minute .
in a sense , this seemed fated .
bildunterschrift : a schweinsteiger cross , a mueller goal , a whole different ballgame the south americans ' defensive frailties had shown up in prior games in this tournament , as when martin demichelis errors gifted goals to south korea and mexico , but in those cases argentina had been cruising to victory and thus went unpunished for their sloppy play .
this time was different .
nicolas otamendi 's lackadaisical marking allowed thomas mueller to break the ice in a game - a costly error , as it turned out .
argentina did take more possession as the first half went on , but never did much with it , probing around the edge of the penalty area to no avail .
germany 's passing on its frequent counter-attacks , meanwhile , was crisp , purposeful , and foreshadowed the goals that would later flood in .
plan b with the likes of messi and tevez making little headway through the middle and higuain starved of service , argentina turned to the flanks .
many of their offensive moves in the latter stages of the first half were played through angel di maria , who took advantage of the space he found out on the wings .

and so it was , but few had predicted what a mismatch that would be . on saturday afternoon , germany delighted its fans - and struck a blow for fans of teamwork everywhere - by leveling an argentina side long on reputation and individual skill but short on ideas .
from start to finish , germany 's tactical discipline was miles ahead of argentina , and their combination play created far more goal-scoring chances .
the 4-0 finish was surprising , but richly deserved too .
argentina 's vaunted danger men - lionel messi , carlos tevez , and gonzalo higuain - never got into gear , seeming to have no answer to germany 's dogged defending , and wary of making a mistake that could touch off a german counter .
" our defensive effort was unbelievable , " said germany coach joachim loew after the match .
" messi , and also higuain and tevez were taken out of the game , and we hardly even fouled them .
we tackled at a very high level - exactly what i like to see . "
to be fair , argentina were put on the back foot early , giving up a soft goal in the third minute .
in a sense , this seemed fated .
bildunterschrift : a schweinsteiger cross , a mueller goal , a whole different ballgame the south americans ' defensive frailties had shown up in prior games in this tournament , as when martin demichelis errors gifted goals to south korea and mexico , but in those cases argentina had been cruising to victory and thus went unpunished for their sloppy play .
this time was different .
nicolas otamendi 's lackadaisical marking allowed thomas mueller to break the ice in a game - a costly error , as it turned out .
argentina did take more possession as the first half went on , but never did much with it , probing around the edge of the penalty area to no avail .
germany 's passing on its frequent counter-attacks , meanwhile , was crisp , purposeful , and foreshadowed the goals that would later flood in .
plan b with the likes of messi and tevez making little headway through the middle and higuain starved of service , argentina turned to the flanks .
many of their offensive moves in the latter stages of the first half were played through angel di maria , who took advantage of the space he found out on the wings .

in front of more than 1,000 cheering onlookers at a packed concert hall in the capital bishkek , otunbayeva somberly took her oath and promised a new political era for crisis-ridden kyrgyzstan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic violence has died down since erupting in april " as president , i will spare no effort to create a new political culture for the country based on a strict adherence to the rule of law , " she told the assembled crowd .
" i must be principled and consistently make demands on all branches of government to ensure it .
the new policy can not be built on fantasies and illusions .
it must be real and effective . "
inauguration comes at delicate moment otunbayeva takes over the government as kyrgyzstan has been wracked by violence and political instability .
thousands have died in ethnic violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks since then-president kurmanbek bakiyev was removed from power in a bloody coup in april .
at least 75,000 people fled to neighboring uzbekistan , leading international aid agencies to warn of an impending humanitarian crisis in dealing with the thousands of families left homeless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of thousands remain homeless in the south the inauguration comes just days after the country overwhelmingly approved a new constitution that will make kyrgyzstan the region 's first parliamentary democracy , a move the government hopes will bring a measure of stability .
the new constitution slashes the powers of the president and sets the stage for parliamentary elections that authorities have scheduled for early october to bring in a permanent government .
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , has questioned the feasibility of kyrgyzstan 's aspirations for a parliamentary democracy , warning that it could lead to further instability in the country and the region .
he said last week on the sidelines of the g20 summit in toronto that a lack of autocratic rule in kyrgyzstan could result in a " relapse into factionalism , " giving rise to a " breeding ground for islamist extremism . "

in a film circulated on the video-sharing website youtube , former tour de france cyclist davide cassani reveals this new form of cheating - riding bikes that are , in fact , motorbikes in disguise .
" these machines have been around since 2004 and they have been used in races by professional cyclists , " cassani told france 's rtl radio .
" there are a lot of benefits using such a bike .
you can reach 50 kilometers an hour .
it has its motor in the frame and a battery between the pedals , " he explains .
suspicious bike swap the italian tv corporation rai has alleged that cancellara swapped bikes suspiciously during the recent paris-roubaix race before going on to victory .
the rider , however , insists the suggestion he used mechanical doping is ridiculous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's fabian cancellara has been linked with mechanical doping but the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- is erring on the side of caution - on june 18 it announced it would tighten its bike checking procedures by introducing a new type of scanner .
" from now on , race service will be subject to stricter regulation in order to ensure that only equipment that has been checked at the start or finish can be used during competitions , " the uci said in a statement .
doping scandals meanwhile , drugs doping is once again casting a shadow over the tour .
italian rider riccardo ricco tested positive three days before the off and doping revelations from former rider floyd landis have implicated seven-time winner lance armstrong , who is taking part in what he says will be his last tour this year .
ricco was handed a two-month suspended jail sentence and a 3,000 euro fine for doping during the 2008 tour de france by a french court on tuesday .
the tour 's organizers insist , however , that it is now harder than ever to cheat .
" considerable progress has been made these past two years , " says christian prudhomme , director of the tour de france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's ricco was handed a suspended sentence for doping during the 2008 tour " now cyclists have to report where they are morning , noon and night every day of the tour .
they also have to carry a biological passport which is designed to root out not only cheats who test positively in traditional tests but those who do n't but whose blood changes its composition suspiciously over time , " he explains .
riders are also subjected to surprise tests before and during the tour .
criticism from the anti-doping agency the french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- , which this year will not be taking part in the drug control process , says that relying on biological passports alone is dangerous .
the afld says additional information from customs authorities and police investigations is needed in the fight against doping .
it also accused the icu of giving preferential treatment to riders such as lance armstrong and last year 's winner alberto contador when it came to surprise testing .
the icu and the afld have a long history of clashes .
in 2009 , they worked together during the tour de france , but the partnership was a failure , according to afld president pierre bordry , who said it would have been impossible to renew the partnership this year .

in a film circulated on the video-sharing website youtube , former tour de france cyclist davide cassani reveals this new form of cheating - riding bikes that are , in fact , motorbikes in disguise .
" these machines have been around since 2004 and they have been used in races by professional cyclists , " cassani told france 's rtl radio .
" there are a lot of benefits using such a bike .
you can reach 50 kilometers an hour .
it has its motor in the frame and a battery between the pedals , " he explains .
suspicious bike swap the italian tv corporation rai has alleged that cancellara swapped bikes suspiciously during the recent paris-roubaix race before going on to victory .
the rider , however , insists the suggestion he used mechanical doping is ridiculous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's fabian cancellara has been linked with mechanical doping but the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- is erring on the side of caution - on june 18 it announced it would tighten its bike checking procedures by introducing a new type of scanner .
" from now on , race service will be subject to stricter regulation in order to ensure that only equipment that has been checked at the start or finish can be used during competitions , " the uci said in a statement .
doping scandals meanwhile , drugs doping is once again casting a shadow over the tour .
italian rider riccardo ricco tested positive three days before the off and doping revelations from former rider floyd landis have implicated seven-time winner lance armstrong , who is taking part in what he says will be his last tour this year .
ricco was handed a two-month suspended jail sentence and a 3,000 euro fine for doping during the 2008 tour de france by a french court on tuesday .
the tour 's organizers insist , however , that it is now harder than ever to cheat .
" considerable progress has been made these past two years , " says christian prudhomme , director of the tour de france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's ricco was handed a suspended sentence for doping during the 2008 tour " now cyclists have to report where they are morning , noon and night every day of the tour .
they also have to carry a biological passport which is designed to root out not only cheats who test positively in traditional tests but those who do n't but whose blood changes its composition suspiciously over time , " he explains .
riders are also subjected to surprise tests before and during the tour .
criticism from the anti-doping agency the french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- , which this year will not be taking part in the drug control process , says that relying on biological passports alone is dangerous .
the afld says additional information from customs authorities and police investigations is needed in the fight against doping .
it also accused the icu of giving preferential treatment to riders such as lance armstrong and last year 's winner alberto contador when it came to surprise testing .
the icu and the afld have a long history of clashes .
in 2009 , they worked together during the tour de france , but the partnership was a failure , according to afld president pierre bordry , who said it would have been impossible to renew the partnership this year .

miroslav klose scored twice , along with goals from thomas mueller and defender arne friedrich . germany have scored four goals for the third time in the world cup , this time dispatching argentina with shocking ease in the quarterfinal .
" now we 're among the best four teams in the world , and that 's exactly where this team belongs , " coach joachim loew said after the game .
" our destiny is in our own hands now , we can achieve something really great here . "
bildunterschrift : coach joachim loew , center , had every reason to cheer as his side banged in four goals - again the germans got off to a flying start , scoring the quickest goal of the world cup this year against a shocked argentina backline , with thomas mueller heading home a free-kick in just the third minute .
the 20-year-old mueller , who was a two-goal hero against england in the previous round , has now scored four in the competition from his position on the right flank .
" it 's insane , after thrashing argentina 4-0 , i 'm almost lost for words , " mueller told reporters after the match .
" the star today , once again , was the team as a whole . "
mueller , however , will play no part in the semifinal .
the bayern munich man picked up his second yellow card of the competition from a handball call that was more than a bit questionable by the referee , meaning he will serve a one-match ban .
" i hope that my teammates get everything right in the semifnal , then i can come back and score another goal in the final , " the upbeat youngster concluded .

even after losing his footing , a seated mueller played a great through-ball for lukas podolski on the left wing , who delivered the perfect cross to miroslav klose in front of goal .
after argentine goalie sergio romero dived for the cross and missed , klose simply had to tap the ball into an open net .

the veteran 's 100th game for his country could hardly have been scripted better .
with his second-half brace , the frontman grabbed his 13th and 14th career world cup goals , meaning he is now level with legendary striker gerd mueller as the most prolific german in world cup history .
he only needs one more to tie the overall record of 15 goals , held by the brazilian goal-machine ronaldo .

schweinsteiger has replaced ballack in style schweinsteiger set up germany 's first and third goals , but his most crucial contribution was controlling the game in the middle of the park from start to finish .

" they 're the best team in the world , in my view .
but we 're good enough , we believe in ourselves . "
germany will now face either european champions spain or paraguay , who play on saturday evening , in the semifinals .

miroslav klose scored twice , along with goals from thomas mueller and defender arne friedrich . germany have scored four goals for the third time in the world cup , this time dispatching argentina with shocking ease in the quarterfinal .
" now we 're among the best four teams in the world , and that 's exactly where this team belongs , " coach joachim loew said after the game .
" our destiny is in our own hands now , we can achieve something really great here . "
bildunterschrift : coach joachim loew , center , had every reason to cheer as his side banged in four goals - again the germans got off to a flying start , scoring the quickest goal of the world cup this year against a shocked argentina backline , with thomas mueller heading home a free-kick in just the third minute .
the 20-year-old mueller , who was a two-goal hero against england in the previous round , has now scored four in the competition from his position on the right flank .
" it 's insane , after thrashing argentina 4-0 , i 'm almost lost for words , " mueller told reporters after the match .
" the star today , once again , was the team as a whole . "
mueller , however , will play no part in the semifinal .
the bayern munich man picked up his second yellow card of the competition from a handball call that was more than a bit questionable by the referee , meaning he will serve a one-match ban .

and so it was , but few had predicted what a mismatch that would be . on saturday afternoon , germany delighted its fans - and struck a blow for fans of teamwork everywhere - by leveling an argentina side long on reputation and individual skill but short on ideas .
from start to finish , germany 's tactical discipline was miles ahead of argentina , and their combination play created far more goal-scoring chances .
the 4-0 finish was surprising , but richly deserved too .
argentina 's vaunted danger men - lionel messi , carlos tevez , and gonzalo higuain - never got into gear , seeming to have no answer to germany 's dogged defending , and wary of making a mistake that could touch off a german counter .
" our defensive effort was unbelievable , " said germany coach joachim loew after the match .
" messi , and also higuain and tevez were taken out of the game , and we hardly even fouled them .
we tackled at a very high level - exactly what i like to see . "
to be fair , argentina were put on the back foot early , giving up a soft goal in the third minute .
in a sense , this seemed fated .
bildunterschrift : a schweinsteiger cross , a mueller goal , a whole different ballgame the south americans ' defensive frailties had shown up in prior games in this tournament , as when martin demichelis errors gifted goals to south korea and mexico , but in those cases argentina had been cruising to victory and thus went unpunished for their sloppy play .
this time was different .
nicolas otamendi 's lackadaisical marking allowed thomas mueller to break the ice in a game - a costly error , as it turned out .
argentina did take more possession as the first half went on , but never did much with it , probing around the edge of the penalty area to no avail .
germany 's passing on its frequent counter-attacks , meanwhile , was crisp , purposeful , and foreshadowed the goals that would later flood in .
plan b with the likes of messi and tevez making little headway through the middle and higuain starved of service , argentina turned to the flanks .
many of their offensive moves in the latter stages of the first half were played through angel di maria , who took advantage of the space he found out on the wings .
his crosses , however , were not good enough to break the german defense - and the times his play did test german goalkeeper manuel neuer were when he shot from distance .
argentina 's second half started brightly , with the team 's build-up play becoming more energetic and direct , but germany , in its short bursts of possession , still appeared more dangerous .
so while it was against the run of play in possession terms , germany 's second , pivotal goal in the 68th minute did not come as a surprise .
in a move reminiscent of so many we have seen from germany over the past few weeks , they got forward in numbers and put the ball exactly where it needed to be when it counted .
bildunterschrift : germany 's second goal settled the contest - argentina never looked like scoring again scary good germany are so locked-in at the moment , even thomas mueller 's slipping to the ground in the midst of the attack that led to the goal was not enough to slow it down .
the ball he fed to lukas podolski was all the more sweet in that he delivered it sitting down .
from then on , argentina were broken .
their defense put in nary a challenge to schweinsteiger as he made his run toward goal on germany 's third in the 74th minute , allowing him to lay off to arne friedrich for a tap-in .
and the fourth , a coast-to coast bum-rush involving just four easy passes , showed there was just one team still on the pitch in the game 's penultimate minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona admitted his side had been well beaten argentina coach diego maradona looked shell-shocked after the game .
all the freedom he 'd given his stars to create , all the praise he 'd lavished on them had come to naught against a team with a plan , and the men to execute it .
" we studied germany well and defined exactly who was playing where but from the first cross they got a goal and suddenly it was a different match , " said maradona .
" they had more ideas and better control of the ball .
they took advantage of the opportunities they had . "
enough said .

and so it was , but few had predicted what a mismatch that would be . on saturday afternoon , germany delighted its fans - and struck a blow for fans of teamwork everywhere - by leveling an argentina side long on reputation and individual skill but short on ideas .
from start to finish , germany 's tactical discipline was miles ahead of argentina , and their combination play created far more goal-scoring chances .
the 4-0 finish was surprising , but richly deserved too .
argentina 's vaunted danger men - lionel messi , carlos tevez , and gonzalo higuain - never got into gear , seeming to have no answer to germany 's dogged defending , and wary of making a mistake that could touch off a german counter .
" our defensive effort was unbelievable , " said germany coach joachim loew after the match .
" messi , and also higuain and tevez were taken out of the game , and we hardly even fouled them .
we tackled at a very high level - exactly what i like to see . "
to be fair , argentina were put on the back foot early , giving up a soft goal in the third minute .
in a sense , this seemed fated .
bildunterschrift : a schweinsteiger cross , a mueller goal , a whole different ballgame the south americans ' defensive frailties had shown up in prior games in this tournament , as when martin demichelis errors gifted goals to south korea and mexico , but in those cases argentina had been cruising to victory and thus went unpunished for their sloppy play .
this time was different .
nicolas otamendi 's lackadaisical marking allowed thomas mueller to break the ice in a game - a costly error , as it turned out .
argentina did take more possession as the first half went on , but never did much with it , probing around the edge of the penalty area to no avail .
germany 's passing on its frequent counter-attacks , meanwhile , was crisp , purposeful , and foreshadowed the goals that would later flood in .
plan b with the likes of messi and tevez making little headway through the middle and higuain starved of service , argentina turned to the flanks .
many of their offensive moves in the latter stages of the first half were played through angel di maria , who took advantage of the space he found out on the wings .
his crosses , however , were not good enough to break the german defense - and the times his play did test german goalkeeper manuel neuer were when he shot from distance .
argentina 's second half started brightly , with the team 's build-up play becoming more energetic and direct , but germany , in its short bursts of possession , still appeared more dangerous .
so while it was against the run of play in possession terms , germany 's second , pivotal goal in the 68th minute did not come as a surprise .
in a move reminiscent of so many we have seen from germany over the past few weeks , they got forward in numbers and put the ball exactly where it needed to be when it counted .
bildunterschrift : germany 's second goal settled the contest - argentina never looked like scoring again scary good germany are so locked-in at the moment , even thomas mueller 's slipping to the ground in the midst of the attack that led to the goal was not enough to slow it down .
the ball he fed to lukas podolski was all the more sweet in that he delivered it sitting down .
from then on , argentina were broken .
their defense put in nary a challenge to schweinsteiger as he made his run toward goal on germany 's third in the 74th minute , allowing him to lay off to arne friedrich for a tap-in .
and the fourth , a coast-to coast bum-rush involving just four easy passes , showed there was just one team still on the pitch in the game 's penultimate minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona admitted his side had been well beaten argentina coach diego maradona looked shell-shocked after the game .
all the freedom he 'd given his stars to create , all the praise he 'd lavished on them had come to naught against a team with a plan , and the men to execute it .
" we studied germany well and defined exactly who was playing where but from the first cross they got a goal and suddenly it was a different match , " said maradona .
" they had more ideas and better control of the ball .
they took advantage of the opportunities they had . "
enough said .

argentina 's second half started brightly , with the team 's build-up play becoming more energetic and direct , but germany , in its short bursts of possession , still appeared more dangerous .
so while it was against the run of play in possession terms , germany 's second , pivotal goal in the 68th minute did not come as a surprise .
in a move reminiscent of so many we have seen from germany over the past few weeks , they got forward in numbers and put the ball exactly where it needed to be when it counted .
bildunterschrift : germany 's second goal settled the contest - argentina never looked like scoring again scary good germany are so locked-in at the moment , even thomas mueller 's slipping to the ground in the midst of the attack that led to the goal was not enough to slow it down .
the ball he fed to lukas podolski was all the more sweet in that he delivered it sitting down .
from then on , argentina were broken .
their defense put in nary a challenge to schweinsteiger as he made his run toward goal on germany 's third in the 74th minute , allowing him to lay off to arne friedrich for a tap-in .
and the fourth , a coast-to coast bum-rush involving just four easy passes , showed there was just one team still on the pitch in the game 's penultimate minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona admitted his side had been well beaten argentina coach diego maradona looked shell-shocked after the game .
all the freedom he 'd given his stars to create , all the praise he 'd lavished on them had come to naught against a team with a plan , and the men to execute it .
" we studied germany well and defined exactly who was playing where but from the first cross they got a goal and suddenly it was a different match , " said maradona .
" they had more ideas and better control of the ball .
they took advantage of the opportunities they had . "
enough said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch world cup -pipe- 03.07.2010 spain finally eke out a win over paraguay , with germany waiting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa 's late goal rescued the spaniards from extra time it took the european champions 82 rather unconvincing minutes , but spain finally managed to put one past a resilient paraguayan defense .
spain will face germany in the semis , after jogi loew 's men thrashed argentina . the match between spain and paraguay was a comparatively stale one , after germany 's up-tempo drubbing of argentina earlier on saturday .
david villa scored for the spaniards late on , but it was a tough route towards the semifinal for his side .
paraguay sat deep , looking to stifle the european champions spain , who played their characteristically composed , but somehow impotent passing game .
spain were confident in possession , sometimes stringing dozens of uninterrupted passes together , but they crafted few real goal scoring opportunities .
for all spain 's possession , paraguay had the ball in the net shortly before half time , with borussia dortmund 's nelson valdez latching on to a long free-kick . the goal was disallowed , perhaps wrongly , in a borderline offside decision .
bildunterschrift : neither side really pulled in the right direction livelier second half in the second half both sides squandered chances from the penalty spot in the space of a few minutes .
paraguay 's oscar cardozo was pulled down in the box , got back up to take the spot-kick himself , but iker casillas made a fairly comfortable save .
in the very next attack david villa won a penalty for spain .
xavi alonso stepped up and scored , but the shot had to be retaken after spanish players rushed into the area before alonso struck .
at the second attempt alonso 's shot was saved in almost the exact same manner as cardozo 's had been moments earlier .
these misses at least provided a necessary spark to the match , and on 82 minutes david villa finally scored the decisive goal for spain , but even then the ball seemed unwilling to cross the goal line .
andres iniesta put pedro clean through , but the substitute 's shot rebounded off the post .
villa was in the right place at the right time , and side-footed the rebound towards goal .
his shot eventually went in , but only after hitting the inside of both posts .
the final few minutes were a frenetic affair , with chances at both ends and spanish defender sergio ramos taking a nasty kick to the face , but in the end the score remained 1-0 spain .
germany watched with interest as victors , spain will go on to face joachim loew 's german side in the semifinals on wednesday .
german midfielder bastian schweinsteiger magnanimously said he believed spain to be the best team in the world , just after his side had staked a claim to that honor with their 4-0 demolition of many people 's tournament favorites argentina .
he did say , however , that germany had what it takes to beat them .
now he will have his chance to find out whether he 's right .

" we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .

" we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .
" these children then go to hamas 's koran schools , " she said , adding that the blockade could thus only fuel radical islamism . an end to isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will not apologize for raiding aid ships social democrat mp rolf muetzenich supports mueller 's criticism of the blockade .

in front of more than 1,000 cheering onlookers at a packed concert hall in the capital bishkek , otunbayeva somberly took her oath and promised a new political era for crisis-ridden kyrgyzstan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic violence has died down since erupting in april " as president , i will spare no effort to create a new political culture for the country based on a strict adherence to the rule of law , " she told the assembled crowd .
" i must be principled and consistently make demands on all branches of government to ensure it .
the new policy can not be built on fantasies and illusions .
it must be real and effective . "
inauguration comes at delicate moment otunbayeva takes over the government as kyrgyzstan has been wracked by violence and political instability .
thousands have died in ethnic violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks since then-president kurmanbek bakiyev was removed from power in a bloody coup in april .
at least 75,000 people fled to neighboring uzbekistan , leading international aid agencies to warn of an impending humanitarian crisis in dealing with the thousands of families left homeless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of thousands remain homeless in the south the inauguration comes just days after the country overwhelmingly approved a new constitution that will make kyrgyzstan the region 's first parliamentary democracy , a move the government hopes will bring a measure of stability .
the new constitution slashes the powers of the president and sets the stage for parliamentary elections that authorities have scheduled for early october to bring in a permanent government .
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , has questioned the feasibility of kyrgyzstan 's aspirations for a parliamentary democracy , warning that it could lead to further instability in the country and the region .
he said last week on the sidelines of the g20 summit in toronto that a lack of autocratic rule in kyrgyzstan could result in a " relapse into factionalism , " giving rise to a " breeding ground for islamist extremism . "

referring to that fight , captain philipp lahm said he thought its genesis was simple : the argentines " do n't know how to lose . "

returning fire … or holding it ?

argentina defeated germany in that recent friendly in munich 1-0 - a score line that flattered the comprehensively beaten hosts .

he said his team " did n't have time to think about schweinsteiger " and ended a television interview by teasing the player .

" even before the game , they 're at it .
the way they gesture , their attempts to influence the referee .
it shows a lack of respect , but that 's just the way the argentines are . "
bastian schweinsteiger , making clear what he thinks of argentina this week .
he also shared his most vivid memory of the game between the two sides at the same quarterfinal stage of the 2006 tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger did n't mince words about argentina " what i remember most is what happened after the game , the brawl which was triggered by the argentinians , " said the germany midfielder .
referring to that fight , captain philipp lahm said he thought its genesis was simple : the argentines " do n't know how to lose . "
the post-match melee meant a suspension for schweinsteiger 's predecessor in germany 's holding midfield role , torsten frings .
the german team went on to lose their next match to italy , and many in germany still feel frings ' absence was decisive in the semi-final defeat .
schweinsteiger said nothing of the kind would happen this time .
" we will not be intimidated or respond to their provocations .
i hope the referee will be watching the game closely , " he said .
returning fire … or holding it ?
having been provoked , the argentina camp wasted little time in firing back - through the ever-passionate carlos tevez .
" i was more afraid of mexico than germany , " tevez told the argentine newspaper clarin .
" the mexicans play better football . "
ouch .
bildunterschrift : just as he was in 2006 , tevez will be a handful for german defenders like arne friedrich other than tevez 's snap , however , the south americans tried to stay low-key .
martin demichelis , who plays in germany for bayern munich , said their recent record against germany does all the talking .
" all the criticisms they make are a sign of respect and nerves .
since we beat them in march , they respect us , " he said .
argentina defeated germany in that recent friendly in munich 1-0 - a score line that flattered the comprehensively beaten hosts .
upon hearing schweinsteiger 's comments , coach diego maradona was even more dismissive .
he said his team " did n't have time to think about schweinsteiger " and ended a television interview by teasing the player .
" what 's the matter with you , schweinsteiger ?
are you getting nervous ? " said the football legend , in a mock-german accent .
switching focus just over 24 hours before the match , however , germany coach joachim loew tried to change the tone of the conversation .
firstly with kindness , as he spoke of his memories of maradona the player he galvanized the whole football world with the way he played .
he was simply magic , " said loew , who never played a starring role on the pitch himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona-fan loew is known for his nose for good football " 1986 and 1990 were the culmination of maradona 's career and he left a mark on football like no other player has ever done before or since . "
he then shared his own thoughts on the post-match fight in 2006 - which he had witnessed as an assistant coach .
" if you ask me , i think that game was at no time brutal or unfair until after the penalties .
it was tightly contested but not marred by unfairness .
the problem in 2006 started after the game had been decided , " said loew .
still , loew said his team would not come out feeling overburdened by the history between the two teams , which includes not just the 2006 brawl but two consecutive world cup finals in 1986 and 1990 , with each side getting the better of the other once .
" we will not be shivering in the changing rooms , hoping the referee wo n't start the game , " said loew .
" in matches like these , " he added , " i do n't really have to help the players with any motivational tricks . "

the us company hopes to succeed in a market where numerous german food retailers and internet startups so far have struggled - or failed . consumers in germany can now turn to amazon to purchase not only books , movies and other popular merchandise but also groceries , including fresh fruit , vegetables and meat .
the new online offering covers more than 35,000 products .
most of them are supplied by a network of more than 60 suppliers , including froodies , gourmantis and moevenpick .
same-day delivery delivery for edibles is the same as amazon 's normal service in germany , which is free for purchases above 20 euros .
and , initially in berlin and frankfurt , the company guarantees same-day delivery for orders made before 11 am .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is hoping that convenience will spur people to buy food online amazon has been selling a range of food products in the united states since 2006 , adding perishables like grapes and steaks a couple years ago .
but online food sales have been anything but easy .
prior to the launch of its own online grocery offer , the company made numerous investments in web-to-doorstep grocery delivery ventures in the us during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s .
homegrocer.com , kozo.com and webvan were among them .
all failed , largely due to the need to build up a massive logistical infrastructure .
short distances to stores since then , amazon claims it has learned to work with regional partners to overcome challenges such as sourcing local products and providing an uncomplicated delivery infrastructure .
this regional partnership model is what the company hopes to transplant successfully in germany .

" all of the big food retailers in germany , like edeka , real and rewe , have launched online delivery services , then discontinued them only to try again , but so far without huge success , " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert told deutsche welle .
" germany is a country of short distances to stores .
people are simply used to going to stores to buy their groceries . "
online food sales in germany , according to wolfgang adelwarth at market-research company gfk , account for less than 1 percent of the country 's 150-billion-plus grocery market .
trend toward convenience " i see a very limited market for online food sales , " adelwarth told deutsche welle .
" there is a market for speciality products , like wine , and there is a group of young professionals who are too busy too shop in stores , but beyond that i do n't see huge demand in germany . "
still , eggert points to a trend toward convenience among german consumers , both young and old , that could spur online food sales .
but a successful online grocery delivery service in the country , he warns , will not come quickly or cheaply .
" it will take time and money , which amazon has , " eggert said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edeka is one of several big german supermarkets to test the waters for online food sales like the us , germany has seen its fair share of online grocers come and go .
" all of the big food retailers in germany , like edeka , real and rewe , have launched online delivery services , then discontinued them only to try again , but so far without huge success , " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert told deutsche welle .
" germany is a country of short distances to stores .
people are simply used to going to stores to buy their groceries . "
online food sales in germany , according to wolfgang adelwarth at market-research company gfk , account for less than 1 percent of the country 's 150-billion-plus grocery market .
trend toward convenience " i see a very limited market for online food sales , " adelwarth told deutsche welle .
" there is a market for speciality products , like wine , and there is a group of young professionals who are too busy too shop in stores , but beyond that i do n't see huge demand in germany . "
still , eggert points to a trend toward convenience among german consumers , both young and old , that could spur online food sales .
but a successful online grocery delivery service in the country , he warns , will not come quickly or cheaply .
" it will take time and money , which amazon has , " eggert said .
" the company clearly sees an opportunity . "

the gigantic eurozone rescue plan has succeeded , at least for now , in stabilizing the common european currency .
but capital markets remain skeptical .
the search for a remedy continues . in the eyes of many experts , the euro is still ailing .
but what they do n't know is whether it 's just a cold , which can be treated , or a terminal illness .
no one seems to have the right remedy .
that worries hans-olaf henkel , the former president of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- who also served as managing director of ibm deutschland : he believes the euro has failed and gives germany part of the blame .
" we have not complied with our own guidelines , which certainly would have made the euro a success , " henkel said .
together with the french government , he adds , the german government weakened the stability pact by breaching its criteria – " without an emergency , without a financial or economic crisis , and without a euro crisis . "
' greece isnt 't entirely to blame ' european parliamentarian elmar brok , a member of germany 's christian democratic union party , agrees that greece is n't entirely to blame for the euro mess .
" often the feeling in brussels is that if the big nations need to bend the rules , they change the rules , " brok said .
" but when the smaller nations try to bend the rules , they 're hung out to dry .
we need to make perfectly clear that we germans have a responsibility to restore trust in our own standing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bdi president hans-olaf henkel believes the euro has failed but the german government 's hesitant response to the crisis has shaken trust in the euro .
at the beginning of may , the european union agreed to a 750-billion-euro rescue package for the common currency – in a bid to calm turbulent financial markets .
after grinding its gears , the german government switched into the fast lane and approved 147 billion euros in aid .
andreas schmitz , president of the association of german banks , believes berlin moved too fast , however .
" if the money is already lying in front of you on the table , you grab it , " he said .
" a better idea is to dangle the money and be told that it 's all yours if you 're willing to accept certain conditions . "
european currency watchdogs observers agree the eu will have to live with its own mistakes as it searches for remedies to cure the ailing euro .
the european monetary fund , favored by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , has been sharply criticized by european currency watchdogs .
they fear such a fund would allow debt-ridden nations to pull back on their austerity efforts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts argue for giving the european commission greater economic control another idea making the rounds is the establishment of a european economic government .
france hatched the idea and , until recently , stood alone in its support .
then germany showed interest and , more recently , members of the eu summit in june backed the notion of a common economic policy .
if there is to be an agreement , christian calliess , a european affairs expert at berlin 's free university , expects member states will be willing to give the eu greater economic control rather than responsibility for drafting economic policy .
" i can imagine plenty of control options , like giving greater responsibilities to the european commission and other community bodies to oversee the budgets of member states , " calliess said .
tough action if there is a consensus in the eurozone today , it 's to combat not the symptoms but the causes of the euro 's illness .
that means getting a handle on government debt to halt speculation against the euro .
and that , says calliess , implies taking some tough action .
" in the event of an extreme case like greece , we need to have the possibility of allowing a country to file for insolvency in much the same way a company does in the private sector , " he said .
for sure , this could be a risky operation but it 's one that could prevent the euro from becoming a chronically ill , weak currency .

the gigantic eurozone rescue plan has succeeded , at least for now , in stabilizing the common european currency .
but capital markets remain skeptical .
the search for a remedy continues . in the eyes of many experts , the euro is still ailing .
but what they do n't know is whether it 's just a cold , which can be treated , or a terminal illness .
no one seems to have the right remedy .
that worries hans-olaf henkel , the former president of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- who also served as managing director of ibm deutschland : he believes the euro has failed and gives germany part of the blame .
" we have not complied with our own guidelines , which certainly would have made the euro a success , " henkel said .
together with the french government , he adds , the german government weakened the stability pact by breaching its criteria – " without an emergency , without a financial or economic crisis , and without a euro crisis . "
' greece isnt 't entirely to blame ' european parliamentarian elmar brok , a member of germany 's christian democratic union party , agrees that greece is n't entirely to blame for the euro mess .
" often the feeling in brussels is that if the big nations need to bend the rules , they change the rules , " brok said .
" but when the smaller nations try to bend the rules , they 're hung out to dry .
we need to make perfectly clear that we germans have a responsibility to restore trust in our own standing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bdi president hans-olaf henkel believes the euro has failed but the german government 's hesitant response to the crisis has shaken trust in the euro .
at the beginning of may , the european union agreed to a 750-billion-euro rescue package for the common currency – in a bid to calm turbulent financial markets .
after grinding its gears , the german government switched into the fast lane and approved 147 billion euros in aid .
andreas schmitz , president of the association of german banks , believes berlin moved too fast , however .
" if the money is already lying in front of you on the table , you grab it , " he said .
" a better idea is to dangle the money and be told that it 's all yours if you 're willing to accept certain conditions . "
european currency watchdogs observers agree the eu will have to live with its own mistakes as it searches for remedies to cure the ailing euro .
the european monetary fund , favored by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , has been sharply criticized by european currency watchdogs .
they fear such a fund would allow debt-ridden nations to pull back on their austerity efforts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts argue for giving the european commission greater economic control another idea making the rounds is the establishment of a european economic government .
france hatched the idea and , until recently , stood alone in its support .
then germany showed interest and , more recently , members of the eu summit in june backed the notion of a common economic policy .
if there is to be an agreement , christian calliess , a european affairs expert at berlin 's free university , expects member states will be willing to give the eu greater economic control rather than responsibility for drafting economic policy .
" i can imagine plenty of control options , like giving greater responsibilities to the european commission and other community bodies to oversee the budgets of member states , " calliess said .
tough action if there is a consensus in the eurozone today , it 's to combat not the symptoms but the causes of the euro 's illness .
that means getting a handle on government debt to halt speculation against the euro .
and that , says calliess , implies taking some tough action .
" in the event of an extreme case like greece , we need to have the possibility of allowing a country to file for insolvency in much the same way a company does in the private sector , " he said .
for sure , this could be a risky operation but it 's one that could prevent the euro from becoming a chronically ill , weak currency .

" even before the game , they 're at it .
the way they gesture , their attempts to influence the referee .
it shows a lack of respect , but that 's just the way the argentines are . "
bastian schweinsteiger , making clear what he thinks of argentina this week .
he also shared his most vivid memory of the game between the two sides at the same quarterfinal stage of the 2006 tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger did n't mince words about argentina " what i remember most is what happened after the game , the brawl which was triggered by the argentinians , " said the germany midfielder .
referring to that fight , captain philipp lahm said he thought its genesis was simple : the argentines " do n't know how to lose . "
the post-match melee meant a suspension for schweinsteiger 's predecessor in germany 's holding midfield role , torsten frings .
the german team went on to lose their next match to italy , and many in germany still feel frings ' absence was decisive in the semi-final defeat .
schweinsteiger said nothing of the kind would happen this time .
" we will not be intimidated or respond to their provocations .
i hope the referee will be watching the game closely , " he said .
returning fire … or holding it ?
having been provoked , the argentina camp wasted little time in firing back - through the ever-passionate carlos tevez .
" i was more afraid of mexico than germany , " tevez told the argentine newspaper clarin .
" the mexicans play better football . "
ouch .
bildunterschrift : just as he was in 2006 , tevez will be a handful for german defenders like arne friedrich other than tevez 's snap , however , the south americans tried to stay low-key .
martin demichelis , who plays in germany for bayern munich , said their recent record against germany does all the talking .
" all the criticisms they make are a sign of respect and nerves .
since we beat them in march , they respect us , " he said .
argentina defeated germany in that recent friendly in munich 1-0 - a score line that flattered the comprehensively beaten hosts .
upon hearing schweinsteiger 's comments , coach diego maradona was even more dismissive .
he said his team " did n't have time to think about schweinsteiger " and ended a television interview by teasing the player .
" what 's the matter with you , schweinsteiger ?
are you getting nervous ? " said the football legend , in a mock-german accent .
switching focus just over 24 hours before the match , however , germany coach joachim loew tried to change the tone of the conversation .
firstly with kindness , as he spoke of his memories of maradona the player he galvanized the whole football world with the way he played .
he was simply magic , " said loew , who never played a starring role on the pitch himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona-fan loew is known for his nose for good football " 1986 and 1990 were the culmination of maradona 's career and he left a mark on football like no other player has ever done before or since . "
he then shared his own thoughts on the post-match fight in 2006 - which he had witnessed as an assistant coach .
" if you ask me , i think that game was at no time brutal or unfair until after the penalties .
it was tightly contested but not marred by unfairness .
the problem in 2006 started after the game had been decided , " said loew .
still , loew said his team would not come out feeling overburdened by the history between the two teams , which includes not just the 2006 brawl but two consecutive world cup finals in 1986 and 1990 , with each side getting the better of the other once .
" we will not be shivering in the changing rooms , hoping the referee wo n't start the game , " said loew .
" in matches like these , " he added , " i do n't really have to help the players with any motivational tricks . "

the us company hopes to succeed in a market where numerous german food retailers and internet startups so far have struggled - or failed . consumers in germany can now turn to amazon to purchase not only books , movies and other popular merchandise but also groceries , including fresh fruit , vegetables and meat .
the new online offering covers more than 35,000 products .
most of them are supplied by a network of more than 60 suppliers , including froodies , gourmantis and moevenpick .
same-day delivery delivery for edibles is the same as amazon 's normal service in germany , which is free for purchases above 20 euros .
and , initially in berlin and frankfurt , the company guarantees same-day delivery for orders made before 11 am .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is hoping that convenience will spur people to buy food online amazon has been selling a range of food products in the united states since 2006 , adding perishables like grapes and steaks a couple years ago .
but online food sales have been anything but easy .
prior to the launch of its own online grocery offer , the company made numerous investments in web-to-doorstep grocery delivery ventures in the us during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s .
homegrocer.com , kozo.com and webvan were among them .
all failed , largely due to the need to build up a massive logistical infrastructure .
short distances to stores since then , amazon claims it has learned to work with regional partners to overcome challenges such as sourcing local products and providing an uncomplicated delivery infrastructure .
this regional partnership model is what the company hopes to transplant successfully in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edeka is one of several big german supermarkets to test the waters for online food sales like the us , germany has seen its fair share of online grocers come and go .
" all of the big food retailers in germany , like edeka , real and rewe , have launched online delivery services , then discontinued them only to try again , but so far without huge success , " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert told deutsche welle .
" germany is a country of short distances to stores .
people are simply used to going to stores to buy their groceries . "
online food sales in germany , according to wolfgang adelwarth at market-research company gfk , account for less than 1 percent of the country 's 150-billion-plus grocery market .
trend toward convenience " i see a very limited market for online food sales , " adelwarth told deutsche welle .
" there is a market for speciality products , like wine , and there is a group of young professionals who are too busy too shop in stores , but beyond that i do n't see huge demand in germany . "
still , eggert points to a trend toward convenience among german consumers , both young and old , that could spur online food sales .
but a successful online grocery delivery service in the country , he warns , will not come quickly or cheaply .
" it will take time and money , which amazon has , " eggert said .
" the company clearly sees an opportunity . "

spain will face germany in the semis , after jogi loew 's men thrashed argentina . the match between spain and paraguay was a comparatively stale one , after germany 's up-tempo drubbing of argentina earlier on saturday .
david villa scored for the spaniards late on , but it was a tough route towards the semifinal for his side .
paraguay sat deep , looking to stifle the european champions spain , who played their characteristically composed , but somehow impotent passing game .
spain were confident in possession , sometimes stringing dozens of uninterrupted passes together , but they crafted few real goal scoring opportunities .
for all spain 's possession , paraguay had the ball in the net shortly before half time , with borussia dortmund 's nelson valdez latching on to a long free-kick . the goal was disallowed , perhaps wrongly , in a borderline offside decision .
bildunterschrift : neither side really pulled in the right direction livelier second half in the second half both sides squandered chances from the penalty spot in the space of a few minutes .
paraguay 's oscar cardozo was pulled down in the box , got back up to take the spot-kick himself , but iker casillas made a fairly comfortable save .
in the very next attack david villa won a penalty for spain .
xavi alonso stepped up and scored , but the shot had to be retaken after spanish players rushed into the area before alonso struck .
at the second attempt alonso 's shot was saved in almost the exact same manner as cardozo 's had been moments earlier .
these misses at least provided a necessary spark to the match , and on 82 minutes david villa finally scored the decisive goal for spain , but even then the ball seemed unwilling to cross the goal line .
andres iniesta put pedro clean through , but the substitute 's shot rebounded off the post .
villa was in the right place at the right time , and side-footed the rebound towards goal .
his shot eventually went in , but only after hitting the inside of both posts .
the final few minutes were a frenetic affair , with chances at both ends and spanish defender sergio ramos taking a nasty kick to the face , but in the end the score remained 1-0 spain .
germany watched with interest as victors , spain will go on to face joachim loew 's german side in the semifinals on wednesday .
german midfielder bastian schweinsteiger magnanimously said he believed spain to be the best team in the world , just after his side had staked a claim to that honor with their 4-0 demolition of many people 's tournament favorites argentina .
he did say , however , that germany had what it takes to beat them .
now he will have his chance to find out whether he 's right .

miroslav klose scored twice , along with goals from thomas mueller and defender arne friedrich . germany have scored four goals for the third time in the world cup , this time dispatching argentina with shocking ease in the quarterfinal .
" now we 're among the best four teams in the world , and that 's exactly where this team belongs , " coach joachim loew said after the game .
" our destiny is in our own hands now , we can achieve something really great here . "
bildunterschrift : coach joachim loew , center , had every reason to cheer as his side banged in four goals - again the germans got off to a flying start , scoring the quickest goal of the world cup this year against a shocked argentina backline , with thomas mueller heading home a free-kick in just the third minute .
the 20-year-old mueller , who was a two-goal hero against england in the previous round , has now scored four in the competition from his position on the right flank .
" it 's insane , after thrashing argentina 4-0 , i 'm almost lost for words , " mueller told reporters after the match .
" the star today , once again , was the team as a whole . "
mueller , however , will play no part in the semifinal .
the bayern munich man picked up his second yellow card of the competition from a handball call that was more than a bit questionable by the referee , meaning he will serve a one-match ban .
" i hope that my teammates get everything right in the semifnal , then i can come back and score another goal in the final , " the upbeat youngster concluded .
scorer turns provider despite this setback , mueller remained a key man going forward for joachim loew 's men , and displayed fantastic determination and awareness in the build up for germany 's second goal .
even after losing his footing , a seated mueller played a great through-ball for lukas podolski on the left wing , who delivered the perfect cross to miroslav klose in front of goal .
after argentine goalie sergio romero dived for the cross and missed , klose simply had to tap the ball into an open net .
moments later arne friedrich - pushing forward from the center of defense - put the finishing touches on a great cross from bastian schweinsteiger to make it 3-0 germany with just a quarter of an hour to play .
closing in on the record bildunterschrift : miroslav klose , left , only needs two more goals to become the world cup 's deadliest ever striker in the dying minutes , with argentina clearly broken , germany made it four , again through miroslav klose .
the veteran 's 100th game for his country could hardly have been scripted better .
with his second-half brace , the frontman grabbed his 13th and 14th career world cup goals , meaning he is now level with legendary striker gerd mueller as the most prolific german in world cup history .
he only needs one more to tie the overall record of 15 goals , held by the brazilian goal-machine ronaldo .
schweinsteiger shines holding midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who has excelled while filling the boots of injured german captain michael ballack during the competition , was awarded man of the match for his performance .

and so it was , but few had predicted what a mismatch that would be . on saturday afternoon , germany delighted its fans - and struck a blow for fans of teamwork everywhere - by leveling an argentina side long on reputation and individual skill but short on ideas .
from start to finish , germany 's tactical discipline was miles ahead of argentina , and their combination play created far more goal-scoring chances .
the 4-0 finish was surprising , but richly deserved too .
argentina 's vaunted danger men - lionel messi , carlos tevez , and gonzalo higuain - never got into gear , seeming to have no answer to germany 's dogged defending , and wary of making a mistake that could touch off a german counter .
" our defensive effort was unbelievable , " said germany coach joachim loew after the match .
" messi , and also higuain and tevez were taken out of the game , and we hardly even fouled them .
we tackled at a very high level - exactly what i like to see . "
to be fair , argentina were put on the back foot early , giving up a soft goal in the third minute .
in a sense , this seemed fated .
bildunterschrift : a schweinsteiger cross , a mueller goal , a whole different ballgame the south americans ' defensive frailties had shown up in prior games in this tournament , as when martin demichelis errors gifted goals to south korea and mexico , but in those cases argentina had been cruising to victory and thus went unpunished for their sloppy play .
this time was different .
nicolas otamendi 's lackadaisical marking allowed thomas mueller to break the ice in a game - a costly error , as it turned out .
argentina did take more possession as the first half went on , but never did much with it , probing around the edge of the penalty area to no avail .
germany 's passing on its frequent counter-attacks , meanwhile , was crisp , purposeful , and foreshadowed the goals that would later flood in .
plan b with the likes of messi and tevez making little headway through the middle and higuain starved of service , argentina turned to the flanks .
many of their offensive moves in the latter stages of the first half were played through angel di maria , who took advantage of the space he found out on the wings .
his crosses , however , were not good enough to break the german defense - and the times his play did test german goalkeeper manuel neuer were when he shot from distance .
argentina 's second half started brightly , with the team 's build-up play becoming more energetic and direct , but germany , in its short bursts of possession , still appeared more dangerous .
so while it was against the run of play in possession terms , germany 's second , pivotal goal in the 68th minute did not come as a surprise .
in a move reminiscent of so many we have seen from germany over the past few weeks , they got forward in numbers and put the ball exactly where it needed to be when it counted .
bildunterschrift : germany 's second goal settled the contest - argentina never looked like scoring again scary good germany are so locked-in at the moment , even thomas mueller 's slipping to the ground in the midst of the attack that led to the goal was not enough to slow it down .
the ball he fed to lukas podolski was all the more sweet in that he delivered it sitting down .
from then on , argentina were broken .
their defense put in nary a challenge to schweinsteiger as he made his run toward goal on germany 's third in the 74th minute , allowing him to lay off to arne friedrich for a tap-in .
and the fourth , a coast-to coast bum-rush involving just four easy passes , showed there was just one team still on the pitch in the game 's penultimate minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona admitted his side had been well beaten argentina coach diego maradona looked shell-shocked after the game .
all the freedom he 'd given his stars to create , all the praise he 'd lavished on them had come to naught against a team with a plan , and the men to execute it .
" we studied germany well and defined exactly who was playing where but from the first cross they got a goal and suddenly it was a different match , " said maradona .
" they had more ideas and better control of the ball .
they took advantage of the opportunities they had . "
enough said .

" we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .

in a film circulated on the video-sharing website youtube , former tour de france cyclist davide cassani reveals this new form of cheating - riding bikes that are , in fact , motorbikes in disguise .
" these machines have been around since 2004 and they have been used in races by professional cyclists , " cassani told france 's rtl radio .
" there are a lot of benefits using such a bike .
you can reach 50 kilometers an hour .
it has its motor in the frame and a battery between the pedals , " he explains .
suspicious bike swap the italian tv corporation rai has alleged that cancellara swapped bikes suspiciously during the recent paris-roubaix race before going on to victory .
the rider , however , insists the suggestion he used mechanical doping is ridiculous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's fabian cancellara has been linked with mechanical doping but the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- is erring on the side of caution - on june 18 it announced it would tighten its bike checking procedures by introducing a new type of scanner .
" from now on , race service will be subject to stricter regulation in order to ensure that only equipment that has been checked at the start or finish can be used during competitions , " the uci said in a statement .
doping scandals meanwhile , drugs doping is once again casting a shadow over the tour .
italian rider riccardo ricco tested positive three days before the off and doping revelations from former rider floyd landis have implicated seven-time winner lance armstrong , who is taking part in what he says will be his last tour this year .
ricco was handed a two-month suspended jail sentence and a 3,000 euro fine for doping during the 2008 tour de france by a french court on tuesday .
the tour 's organizers insist , however , that it is now harder than ever to cheat .
" considerable progress has been made these past two years , " says christian prudhomme , director of the tour de france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's ricco was handed a suspended sentence for doping during the 2008 tour " now cyclists have to report where they are morning , noon and night every day of the tour .
they also have to carry a biological passport which is designed to root out not only cheats who test positively in traditional tests but those who do n't but whose blood changes its composition suspiciously over time , " he explains .
riders are also subjected to surprise tests before and during the tour .
criticism from the anti-doping agency the french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- , which this year will not be taking part in the drug control process , says that relying on biological passports alone is dangerous .
the afld says additional information from customs authorities and police investigations is needed in the fight against doping .
it also accused the icu of giving preferential treatment to riders such as lance armstrong and last year 's winner alberto contador when it came to surprise testing .
the icu and the afld have a long history of clashes .
in 2009 , they worked together during the tour de france , but the partnership was a failure , according to afld president pierre bordry , who said it would have been impossible to renew the partnership this year .

in front of more than 1,000 cheering onlookers at a packed concert hall in the capital bishkek , otunbayeva somberly took her oath and promised a new political era for crisis-ridden kyrgyzstan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic violence has died down since erupting in april " as president , i will spare no effort to create a new political culture for the country based on a strict adherence to the rule of law , " she told the assembled crowd .

inauguration comes at delicate moment otunbayeva takes over the government as kyrgyzstan has been wracked by violence and political instability .
thousands have died in ethnic violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks since then-president kurmanbek bakiyev was removed from power in a bloody coup in april .

the new constitution slashes the powers of the president and sets the stage for parliamentary elections that authorities have scheduled for early october to bring in a permanent government .
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , has questioned the feasibility of kyrgyzstan 's aspirations for a parliamentary democracy , warning that it could lead to further instability in the country and the region .
he said last week on the sidelines of the g20 summit in toronto that a lack of autocratic rule in kyrgyzstan could result in a " relapse into factionalism , " giving rise to a " breeding ground for islamist extremism . "

miroslav klose scored twice , along with goals from thomas mueller and defender arne friedrich . germany have scored four goals for the third time in the world cup , this time dispatching argentina with shocking ease in the quarterfinal .
" now we 're among the best four teams in the world , and that 's exactly where this team belongs , " coach joachim loew said after the game .
" our destiny is in our own hands now , we can achieve something really great here . "
bildunterschrift : coach joachim loew , center , had every reason to cheer as his side banged in four goals - again the germans got off to a flying start , scoring the quickest goal of the world cup this year against a shocked argentina backline , with thomas mueller heading home a free-kick in just the third minute .
the 20-year-old mueller , who was a two-goal hero against england in the previous round , has now scored four in the competition from his position on the right flank .
" it 's insane , after thrashing argentina 4-0 , i 'm almost lost for words , " mueller told reporters after the match .
" the star today , once again , was the team as a whole . "
mueller , however , will play no part in the semifinal .
the bayern munich man picked up his second yellow card of the competition from a handball call that was more than a bit questionable by the referee , meaning he will serve a one-match ban .
" i hope that my teammates get everything right in the semifnal , then i can come back and score another goal in the final , " the upbeat youngster concluded .
scorer turns provider despite this setback , mueller remained a key man going forward for joachim loew 's men , and displayed fantastic determination and awareness in the build up for germany 's second goal .
even after losing his footing , a seated mueller played a great through-ball for lukas podolski on the left wing , who delivered the perfect cross to miroslav klose in front of goal .
after argentine goalie sergio romero dived for the cross and missed , klose simply had to tap the ball into an open net .
moments later arne friedrich - pushing forward from the center of defense - put the finishing touches on a great cross from bastian schweinsteiger to make it 3-0 germany with just a quarter of an hour to play .
closing in on the record bildunterschrift : miroslav klose , left , only needs two more goals to become the world cup 's deadliest ever striker in the dying minutes , with argentina clearly broken , germany made it four , again through miroslav klose .
the veteran 's 100th game for his country could hardly have been scripted better .
with his second-half brace , the frontman grabbed his 13th and 14th career world cup goals , meaning he is now level with legendary striker gerd mueller as the most prolific german in world cup history .
he only needs one more to tie the overall record of 15 goals , held by the brazilian goal-machine ronaldo .
schweinsteiger shines holding midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who has excelled while filling the boots of injured german captain michael ballack during the competition , was awarded man of the match for his performance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael who ?
schweinsteiger has replaced ballack in style schweinsteiger set up germany 's first and third goals , but his most crucial contribution was controlling the game in the middle of the park from start to finish .
" we may have to play spain next , " the man of the match cautioned after the victory .
" they 're the best team in the world , in my view .
but we 're good enough , we believe in ourselves . "
germany will now face either european champions spain or paraguay , who play on saturday evening , in the semifinals .

spain will face germany in the semis , after jogi loew 's men thrashed argentina . the match between spain and paraguay was a comparatively stale one , after germany 's up-tempo drubbing of argentina earlier on saturday .
david villa scored for the spaniards late on , but it was a tough route towards the semifinal for his side .
paraguay sat deep , looking to stifle the european champions spain , who played their characteristically composed , but somehow impotent passing game .
spain were confident in possession , sometimes stringing dozens of uninterrupted passes together , but they crafted few real goal scoring opportunities .
for all spain 's possession , paraguay had the ball in the net shortly before half time , with borussia dortmund 's nelson valdez latching on to a long free-kick . the goal was disallowed , perhaps wrongly , in a borderline offside decision .
bildunterschrift : neither side really pulled in the right direction livelier second half in the second half both sides squandered chances from the penalty spot in the space of a few minutes .
paraguay 's oscar cardozo was pulled down in the box , got back up to take the spot-kick himself , but iker casillas made a fairly comfortable save .
in the very next attack david villa won a penalty for spain .
xavi alonso stepped up and scored , but the shot had to be retaken after spanish players rushed into the area before alonso struck .
at the second attempt alonso 's shot was saved in almost the exact same manner as cardozo 's had been moments earlier .
these misses at least provided a necessary spark to the match , and on 82 minutes david villa finally scored the decisive goal for spain , but even then the ball seemed unwilling to cross the goal line .
andres iniesta put pedro clean through , but the substitute 's shot rebounded off the post .
villa was in the right place at the right time , and side-footed the rebound towards goal .
his shot eventually went in , but only after hitting the inside of both posts .
the final few minutes were a frenetic affair , with chances at both ends and spanish defender sergio ramos taking a nasty kick to the face , but in the end the score remained 1-0 spain .
germany watched with interest as victors , spain will go on to face joachim loew 's german side in the semifinals on wednesday .
german midfielder bastian schweinsteiger magnanimously said he believed spain to be the best team in the world , just after his side had staked a claim to that honor with their 4-0 demolition of many people 's tournament favorites argentina .
he did say , however , that germany had what it takes to beat them .
now he will have his chance to find out whether he 's right .

bildunterschrift : neither side really pulled in the right direction livelier second half in the second half both sides squandered chances from the penalty spot in the space of a few minutes .
paraguay 's oscar cardozo was pulled down in the box , got back up to take the spot-kick himself , but iker casillas made a fairly comfortable save .
in the very next attack david villa won a penalty for spain .
xavi alonso stepped up and scored , but the shot had to be retaken after spanish players rushed into the area before alonso struck .
at the second attempt alonso 's shot was saved in almost the exact same manner as cardozo 's had been moments earlier .
these misses at least provided a necessary spark to the match , and on 82 minutes david villa finally scored the decisive goal for spain , but even then the ball seemed unwilling to cross the goal line .
andres iniesta put pedro clean through , but the substitute 's shot rebounded off the post .
villa was in the right place at the right time , and side-footed the rebound towards goal .
his shot eventually went in , but only after hitting the inside of both posts .
the final few minutes were a frenetic affair , with chances at both ends and spanish defender sergio ramos taking a nasty kick to the face , but in the end the score remained 1-0 spain .
germany watched with interest as victors , spain will go on to face joachim loew 's german side in the semifinals on wednesday .
german midfielder bastian schweinsteiger magnanimously said he believed spain to be the best team in the world , just after his side had staked a claim to that honor with their 4-0 demolition of many people 's tournament favorites argentina .
he did say , however , that germany had what it takes to beat them .
now he will have his chance to find out whether he 's right .

and so it was , but few had predicted what a mismatch that would be . on saturday afternoon , germany delighted its fans - and struck a blow for fans of teamwork everywhere - by leveling an argentina side long on reputation and individual skill but short on ideas .
from start to finish , germany 's tactical discipline was miles ahead of argentina , and their combination play created far more goal-scoring chances .
the 4-0 finish was surprising , but richly deserved too .
argentina 's vaunted danger men - lionel messi , carlos tevez , and gonzalo higuain - never got into gear , seeming to have no answer to germany 's dogged defending , and wary of making a mistake that could touch off a german counter .
" our defensive effort was unbelievable , " said germany coach joachim loew after the match .
" messi , and also higuain and tevez were taken out of the game , and we hardly even fouled them .
we tackled at a very high level - exactly what i like to see . "

this time was different .
nicolas otamendi 's lackadaisical marking allowed thomas mueller to break the ice in a game - a costly error , as it turned out .
argentina did take more possession as the first half went on , but never did much with it , probing around the edge of the penalty area to no avail .
germany 's passing on its frequent counter-attacks , meanwhile , was crisp , purposeful , and foreshadowed the goals that would later flood in .
plan b with the likes of messi and tevez making little headway through the middle and higuain starved of service , argentina turned to the flanks .
many of their offensive moves in the latter stages of the first half were played through angel di maria , who took advantage of the space he found out on the wings .
his crosses , however , were not good enough to break the german defense - and the times his play did test german goalkeeper manuel neuer were when he shot from distance .
argentina 's second half started brightly , with the team 's build-up play becoming more energetic and direct , but germany , in its short bursts of possession , still appeared more dangerous .
so while it was against the run of play in possession terms , germany 's second , pivotal goal in the 68th minute did not come as a surprise .
in a move reminiscent of so many we have seen from germany over the past few weeks , they got forward in numbers and put the ball exactly where it needed to be when it counted .
bildunterschrift : germany 's second goal settled the contest - argentina never looked like scoring again scary good germany are so locked-in at the moment , even thomas mueller 's slipping to the ground in the midst of the attack that led to the goal was not enough to slow it down .
the ball he fed to lukas podolski was all the more sweet in that he delivered it sitting down .
from then on , argentina were broken .
their defense put in nary a challenge to schweinsteiger as he made his run toward goal on germany 's third in the 74th minute , allowing him to lay off to arne friedrich for a tap-in .
and the fourth , a coast-to coast bum-rush involving just four easy passes , showed there was just one team still on the pitch in the game 's penultimate minute .

and so it was , but few had predicted what a mismatch that would be . on saturday afternoon , germany delighted its fans - and struck a blow for fans of teamwork everywhere - by leveling an argentina side long on reputation and individual skill but short on ideas .
from start to finish , germany 's tactical discipline was miles ahead of argentina , and their combination play created far more goal-scoring chances .
the 4-0 finish was surprising , but richly deserved too .
argentina 's vaunted danger men - lionel messi , carlos tevez , and gonzalo higuain - never got into gear , seeming to have no answer to germany 's dogged defending , and wary of making a mistake that could touch off a german counter .
" our defensive effort was unbelievable , " said germany coach joachim loew after the match .
" messi , and also higuain and tevez were taken out of the game , and we hardly even fouled them .
we tackled at a very high level - exactly what i like to see . "
to be fair , argentina were put on the back foot early , giving up a soft goal in the third minute .
in a sense , this seemed fated .
bildunterschrift : a schweinsteiger cross , a mueller goal , a whole different ballgame the south americans ' defensive frailties had shown up in prior games in this tournament , as when martin demichelis errors gifted goals to south korea and mexico , but in those cases argentina had been cruising to victory and thus went unpunished for their sloppy play .
this time was different .
nicolas otamendi 's lackadaisical marking allowed thomas mueller to break the ice in a game - a costly error , as it turned out .
argentina did take more possession as the first half went on , but never did much with it , probing around the edge of the penalty area to no avail .
germany 's passing on its frequent counter-attacks , meanwhile , was crisp , purposeful , and foreshadowed the goals that would later flood in .
plan b with the likes of messi and tevez making little headway through the middle and higuain starved of service , argentina turned to the flanks .
many of their offensive moves in the latter stages of the first half were played through angel di maria , who took advantage of the space he found out on the wings .
his crosses , however , were not good enough to break the german defense - and the times his play did test german goalkeeper manuel neuer were when he shot from distance .
argentina 's second half started brightly , with the team 's build-up play becoming more energetic and direct , but germany , in its short bursts of possession , still appeared more dangerous .
so while it was against the run of play in possession terms , germany 's second , pivotal goal in the 68th minute did not come as a surprise .
in a move reminiscent of so many we have seen from germany over the past few weeks , they got forward in numbers and put the ball exactly where it needed to be when it counted .
bildunterschrift : germany 's second goal settled the contest - argentina never looked like scoring again scary good germany are so locked-in at the moment , even thomas mueller 's slipping to the ground in the midst of the attack that led to the goal was not enough to slow it down .
the ball he fed to lukas podolski was all the more sweet in that he delivered it sitting down .
from then on , argentina were broken .
their defense put in nary a challenge to schweinsteiger as he made his run toward goal on germany 's third in the 74th minute , allowing him to lay off to arne friedrich for a tap-in .
and the fourth , a coast-to coast bum-rush involving just four easy passes , showed there was just one team still on the pitch in the game 's penultimate minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona admitted his side had been well beaten argentina coach diego maradona looked shell-shocked after the game .
all the freedom he 'd given his stars to create , all the praise he 'd lavished on them had come to naught against a team with a plan , and the men to execute it .

" we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .
" these children then go to hamas 's koran schools , " she said , adding that the blockade could thus only fuel radical islamism . an end to isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will not apologize for raiding aid ships social democrat mp rolf muetzenich supports mueller 's criticism of the blockade .
muetzenich has called for not only humanitarian aid to gaza , but support to help the region rebuild itself economically and end its political isolation . " we must promote the message among the palestinian fractions that only a government of national unity will allow for an ongoing and just peace solution in palestine - and then be of benefit to israel , " he said . all bundestag fractions agreed that an end to the blockade would indeed benefit israel .
" yet we must not lose sight of israel 's security needs , " said christian democrat philipp missfelder - to the applause of the house . author : bettina marx / dl -lrb- dpa -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" even before the game , they 're at it .
the way they gesture , their attempts to influence the referee .
it shows a lack of respect , but that 's just the way the argentines are . "
bastian schweinsteiger , making clear what he thinks of argentina this week .
he also shared his most vivid memory of the game between the two sides at the same quarterfinal stage of the 2006 tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger did n't mince words about argentina " what i remember most is what happened after the game , the brawl which was triggered by the argentinians , " said the germany midfielder .
referring to that fight , captain philipp lahm said he thought its genesis was simple : the argentines " do n't know how to lose . "
the post-match melee meant a suspension for schweinsteiger 's predecessor in germany 's holding midfield role , torsten frings .
the german team went on to lose their next match to italy , and many in germany still feel frings ' absence was decisive in the semi-final defeat .
schweinsteiger said nothing of the kind would happen this time .
" we will not be intimidated or respond to their provocations .
i hope the referee will be watching the game closely , " he said .
returning fire … or holding it ?
having been provoked , the argentina camp wasted little time in firing back - through the ever-passionate carlos tevez .
" i was more afraid of mexico than germany , " tevez told the argentine newspaper clarin .
" the mexicans play better football . "
ouch .
bildunterschrift : just as he was in 2006 , tevez will be a handful for german defenders like arne friedrich other than tevez 's snap , however , the south americans tried to stay low-key .
martin demichelis , who plays in germany for bayern munich , said their recent record against germany does all the talking .
" all the criticisms they make are a sign of respect and nerves .
since we beat them in march , they respect us , " he said .
argentina defeated germany in that recent friendly in munich 1-0 - a score line that flattered the comprehensively beaten hosts .
upon hearing schweinsteiger 's comments , coach diego maradona was even more dismissive .
he said his team " did n't have time to think about schweinsteiger " and ended a television interview by teasing the player .
" what 's the matter with you , schweinsteiger ?
are you getting nervous ? " said the football legend , in a mock-german accent .
switching focus just over 24 hours before the match , however , germany coach joachim loew tried to change the tone of the conversation .
firstly with kindness , as he spoke of his memories of maradona the player he galvanized the whole football world with the way he played .
he was simply magic , " said loew , who never played a starring role on the pitch himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona-fan loew is known for his nose for good football " 1986 and 1990 were the culmination of maradona 's career and he left a mark on football like no other player has ever done before or since . "
he then shared his own thoughts on the post-match fight in 2006 - which he had witnessed as an assistant coach .
" if you ask me , i think that game was at no time brutal or unfair until after the penalties .
it was tightly contested but not marred by unfairness .
the problem in 2006 started after the game had been decided , " said loew .
still , loew said his team would not come out feeling overburdened by the history between the two teams , which includes not just the 2006 brawl but two consecutive world cup finals in 1986 and 1990 , with each side getting the better of the other once .
" we will not be shivering in the changing rooms , hoping the referee wo n't start the game , " said loew .
" in matches like these , " he added , " i do n't really have to help the players with any motivational tricks . "

the us company hopes to succeed in a market where numerous german food retailers and internet startups so far have struggled - or failed . consumers in germany can now turn to amazon to purchase not only books , movies and other popular merchandise but also groceries , including fresh fruit , vegetables and meat .
the new online offering covers more than 35,000 products .
most of them are supplied by a network of more than 60 suppliers , including froodies , gourmantis and moevenpick .
same-day delivery delivery for edibles is the same as amazon 's normal service in germany , which is free for purchases above 20 euros .
and , initially in berlin and frankfurt , the company guarantees same-day delivery for orders made before 11 am .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is hoping that convenience will spur people to buy food online amazon has been selling a range of food products in the united states since 2006 , adding perishables like grapes and steaks a couple years ago .
but online food sales have been anything but easy .
prior to the launch of its own online grocery offer , the company made numerous investments in web-to-doorstep grocery delivery ventures in the us during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s .
homegrocer.com , kozo.com and webvan were among them .
all failed , largely due to the need to build up a massive logistical infrastructure .
short distances to stores since then , amazon claims it has learned to work with regional partners to overcome challenges such as sourcing local products and providing an uncomplicated delivery infrastructure .
this regional partnership model is what the company hopes to transplant successfully in germany .

" all of the big food retailers in germany , like edeka , real and rewe , have launched online delivery services , then discontinued them only to try again , but so far without huge success , " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert told deutsche welle .
" germany is a country of short distances to stores .
people are simply used to going to stores to buy their groceries . "
online food sales in germany , according to wolfgang adelwarth at market-research company gfk , account for less than 1 percent of the country 's 150-billion-plus grocery market .
trend toward convenience " i see a very limited market for online food sales , " adelwarth told deutsche welle .
" there is a market for speciality products , like wine , and there is a group of young professionals who are too busy too shop in stores , but beyond that i do n't see huge demand in germany . "
still , eggert points to a trend toward convenience among german consumers , both young and old , that could spur online food sales .
but a successful online grocery delivery service in the country , he warns , will not come quickly or cheaply .
" it will take time and money , which amazon has , " eggert said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 03.07.2010 online giant amazon enters the grocery business in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon started selling books , but has gone far beyond that amazon has begun selling food , including fresh products , to consumers in germany .
the us company hopes to succeed in a market where numerous german food retailers and internet startups so far have struggled - or failed . consumers in germany can now turn to amazon to purchase not only books , movies and other popular merchandise but also groceries , including fresh fruit , vegetables and meat .
the new online offering covers more than 35,000 products .
most of them are supplied by a network of more than 60 suppliers , including froodies , gourmantis and moevenpick .
same-day delivery delivery for edibles is the same as amazon 's normal service in germany , which is free for purchases above 20 euros .
and , initially in berlin and frankfurt , the company guarantees same-day delivery for orders made before 11 am .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is hoping that convenience will spur people to buy food online amazon has been selling a range of food products in the united states since 2006 , adding perishables like grapes and steaks a couple years ago .
but online food sales have been anything but easy .
prior to the launch of its own online grocery offer , the company made numerous investments in web-to-doorstep grocery delivery ventures in the us during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s .
homegrocer.com , kozo.com and webvan were among them .
all failed , largely due to the need to build up a massive logistical infrastructure .
short distances to stores since then , amazon claims it has learned to work with regional partners to overcome challenges such as sourcing local products and providing an uncomplicated delivery infrastructure .
this regional partnership model is what the company hopes to transplant successfully in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edeka is one of several big german supermarkets to test the waters for online food sales like the us , germany has seen its fair share of online grocers come and go .
" all of the big food retailers in germany , like edeka , real and rewe , have launched online delivery services , then discontinued them only to try again , but so far without huge success , " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert told deutsche welle .
" germany is a country of short distances to stores .
people are simply used to going to stores to buy their groceries . "
online food sales in germany , according to wolfgang adelwarth at market-research company gfk , account for less than 1 percent of the country 's 150-billion-plus grocery market .
trend toward convenience " i see a very limited market for online food sales , " adelwarth told deutsche welle .
" there is a market for speciality products , like wine , and there is a group of young professionals who are too busy too shop in stores , but beyond that i do n't see huge demand in germany . "
still , eggert points to a trend toward convenience among german consumers , both young and old , that could spur online food sales .
but a successful online grocery delivery service in the country , he warns , will not come quickly or cheaply .
" it will take time and money , which amazon has , " eggert said .
" the company clearly sees an opportunity . "

in front of more than 1,000 cheering onlookers at a packed concert hall in the capital bishkek , otunbayeva somberly took her oath and promised a new political era for crisis-ridden kyrgyzstan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic violence has died down since erupting in april " as president , i will spare no effort to create a new political culture for the country based on a strict adherence to the rule of law , " she told the assembled crowd .
" i must be principled and consistently make demands on all branches of government to ensure it .
the new policy can not be built on fantasies and illusions .
it must be real and effective . "
inauguration comes at delicate moment otunbayeva takes over the government as kyrgyzstan has been wracked by violence and political instability .
thousands have died in ethnic violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks since then-president kurmanbek bakiyev was removed from power in a bloody coup in april .
at least 75,000 people fled to neighboring uzbekistan , leading international aid agencies to warn of an impending humanitarian crisis in dealing with the thousands of families left homeless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of thousands remain homeless in the south the inauguration comes just days after the country overwhelmingly approved a new constitution that will make kyrgyzstan the region 's first parliamentary democracy , a move the government hopes will bring a measure of stability .
the new constitution slashes the powers of the president and sets the stage for parliamentary elections that authorities have scheduled for early october to bring in a permanent government .
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , has questioned the feasibility of kyrgyzstan 's aspirations for a parliamentary democracy , warning that it could lead to further instability in the country and the region .
he said last week on the sidelines of the g20 summit in toronto that a lack of autocratic rule in kyrgyzstan could result in a " relapse into factionalism , " giving rise to a " breeding ground for islamist extremism . "

" even before the game , they 're at it .
the way they gesture , their attempts to influence the referee .
it shows a lack of respect , but that 's just the way the argentines are . "
bastian schweinsteiger , making clear what he thinks of argentina this week .
he also shared his most vivid memory of the game between the two sides at the same quarterfinal stage of the 2006 tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger did n't mince words about argentina " what i remember most is what happened after the game , the brawl which was triggered by the argentinians , " said the germany midfielder .
referring to that fight , captain philipp lahm said he thought its genesis was simple : the argentines " do n't know how to lose . "
the post-match melee meant a suspension for schweinsteiger 's predecessor in germany 's holding midfield role , torsten frings .
the german team went on to lose their next match to italy , and many in germany still feel frings ' absence was decisive in the semi-final defeat .
schweinsteiger said nothing of the kind would happen this time .
" we will not be intimidated or respond to their provocations .
i hope the referee will be watching the game closely , " he said .
returning fire … or holding it ?
having been provoked , the argentina camp wasted little time in firing back - through the ever-passionate carlos tevez .
" i was more afraid of mexico than germany , " tevez told the argentine newspaper clarin .
" the mexicans play better football . "
ouch .
bildunterschrift : just as he was in 2006 , tevez will be a handful for german defenders like arne friedrich other than tevez 's snap , however , the south americans tried to stay low-key .
martin demichelis , who plays in germany for bayern munich , said their recent record against germany does all the talking .
" all the criticisms they make are a sign of respect and nerves .
since we beat them in march , they respect us , " he said .
argentina defeated germany in that recent friendly in munich 1-0 - a score line that flattered the comprehensively beaten hosts .
upon hearing schweinsteiger 's comments , coach diego maradona was even more dismissive .
he said his team " did n't have time to think about schweinsteiger " and ended a television interview by teasing the player .
" what 's the matter with you , schweinsteiger ?
are you getting nervous ? " said the football legend , in a mock-german accent .
switching focus just over 24 hours before the match , however , germany coach joachim loew tried to change the tone of the conversation .
firstly with kindness , as he spoke of his memories of maradona the player he galvanized the whole football world with the way he played .
he was simply magic , " said loew , who never played a starring role on the pitch himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona-fan loew is known for his nose for good football " 1986 and 1990 were the culmination of maradona 's career and he left a mark on football like no other player has ever done before or since . "
he then shared his own thoughts on the post-match fight in 2006 - which he had witnessed as an assistant coach .
" if you ask me , i think that game was at no time brutal or unfair until after the penalties .
it was tightly contested but not marred by unfairness .
the problem in 2006 started after the game had been decided , " said loew .
still , loew said his team would not come out feeling overburdened by the history between the two teams , which includes not just the 2006 brawl but two consecutive world cup finals in 1986 and 1990 , with each side getting the better of the other once .
" we will not be shivering in the changing rooms , hoping the referee wo n't start the game , " said loew .
" in matches like these , " he added , " i do n't really have to help the players with any motivational tricks . "

" we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .
" these children then go to hamas 's koran schools , " she said , adding that the blockade could thus only fuel radical islamism . an end to isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will not apologize for raiding aid ships social democrat mp rolf muetzenich supports mueller 's criticism of the blockade .
muetzenich has called for not only humanitarian aid to gaza , but support to help the region rebuild itself economically and end its political isolation . " we must promote the message among the palestinian fractions that only a government of national unity will allow for an ongoing and just peace solution in palestine - and then be of benefit to israel , " he said . all bundestag fractions agreed that an end to the blockade would indeed benefit israel .
" yet we must not lose sight of israel 's security needs , " said christian democrat philipp missfelder - to the applause of the house . author : bettina marx / dl -lrb- dpa -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spain will face germany in the semis , after jogi loew 's men thrashed argentina . the match between spain and paraguay was a comparatively stale one , after germany 's up-tempo drubbing of argentina earlier on saturday .
david villa scored for the spaniards late on , but it was a tough route towards the semifinal for his side .
paraguay sat deep , looking to stifle the european champions spain , who played their characteristically composed , but somehow impotent passing game .
spain were confident in possession , sometimes stringing dozens of uninterrupted passes together , but they crafted few real goal scoring opportunities .
for all spain 's possession , paraguay had the ball in the net shortly before half time , with borussia dortmund 's nelson valdez latching on to a long free-kick . the goal was disallowed , perhaps wrongly , in a borderline offside decision .
bildunterschrift : neither side really pulled in the right direction livelier second half in the second half both sides squandered chances from the penalty spot in the space of a few minutes .
paraguay 's oscar cardozo was pulled down in the box , got back up to take the spot-kick himself , but iker casillas made a fairly comfortable save .
in the very next attack david villa won a penalty for spain .
xavi alonso stepped up and scored , but the shot had to be retaken after spanish players rushed into the area before alonso struck .

spain will face germany in the semis , after jogi loew 's men thrashed argentina . the match between spain and paraguay was a comparatively stale one , after germany 's up-tempo drubbing of argentina earlier on saturday .
david villa scored for the spaniards late on , but it was a tough route towards the semifinal for his side .
paraguay sat deep , looking to stifle the european champions spain , who played their characteristically composed , but somehow impotent passing game .
spain were confident in possession , sometimes stringing dozens of uninterrupted passes together , but they crafted few real goal scoring opportunities .
for all spain 's possession , paraguay had the ball in the net shortly before half time , with borussia dortmund 's nelson valdez latching on to a long free-kick . the goal was disallowed , perhaps wrongly , in a borderline offside decision .
bildunterschrift : neither side really pulled in the right direction livelier second half in the second half both sides squandered chances from the penalty spot in the space of a few minutes .
paraguay 's oscar cardozo was pulled down in the box , got back up to take the spot-kick himself , but iker casillas made a fairly comfortable save .
in the very next attack david villa won a penalty for spain .
xavi alonso stepped up and scored , but the shot had to be retaken after spanish players rushed into the area before alonso struck .
at the second attempt alonso 's shot was saved in almost the exact same manner as cardozo 's had been moments earlier .
these misses at least provided a necessary spark to the match , and on 82 minutes david villa finally scored the decisive goal for spain , but even then the ball seemed unwilling to cross the goal line .
andres iniesta put pedro clean through , but the substitute 's shot rebounded off the post .
villa was in the right place at the right time , and side-footed the rebound towards goal .
his shot eventually went in , but only after hitting the inside of both posts .
the final few minutes were a frenetic affair , with chances at both ends and spanish defender sergio ramos taking a nasty kick to the face , but in the end the score remained 1-0 spain .

and so it was , but few had predicted what a mismatch that would be . on saturday afternoon , germany delighted its fans - and struck a blow for fans of teamwork everywhere - by leveling an argentina side long on reputation and individual skill but short on ideas .
from start to finish , germany 's tactical discipline was miles ahead of argentina , and their combination play created far more goal-scoring chances .
the 4-0 finish was surprising , but richly deserved too .
argentina 's vaunted danger men - lionel messi , carlos tevez , and gonzalo higuain - never got into gear , seeming to have no answer to germany 's dogged defending , and wary of making a mistake that could touch off a german counter .
" our defensive effort was unbelievable , " said germany coach joachim loew after the match .
" messi , and also higuain and tevez were taken out of the game , and we hardly even fouled them .
we tackled at a very high level - exactly what i like to see . "
to be fair , argentina were put on the back foot early , giving up a soft goal in the third minute .
in a sense , this seemed fated .
bildunterschrift : a schweinsteiger cross , a mueller goal , a whole different ballgame the south americans ' defensive frailties had shown up in prior games in this tournament , as when martin demichelis errors gifted goals to south korea and mexico , but in those cases argentina had been cruising to victory and thus went unpunished for their sloppy play .
this time was different .
nicolas otamendi 's lackadaisical marking allowed thomas mueller to break the ice in a game - a costly error , as it turned out .
argentina did take more possession as the first half went on , but never did much with it , probing around the edge of the penalty area to no avail .
germany 's passing on its frequent counter-attacks , meanwhile , was crisp , purposeful , and foreshadowed the goals that would later flood in .
plan b with the likes of messi and tevez making little headway through the middle and higuain starved of service , argentina turned to the flanks .
many of their offensive moves in the latter stages of the first half were played through angel di maria , who took advantage of the space he found out on the wings .
his crosses , however , were not good enough to break the german defense - and the times his play did test german goalkeeper manuel neuer were when he shot from distance .
argentina 's second half started brightly , with the team 's build-up play becoming more energetic and direct , but germany , in its short bursts of possession , still appeared more dangerous .
so while it was against the run of play in possession terms , germany 's second , pivotal goal in the 68th minute did not come as a surprise .
in a move reminiscent of so many we have seen from germany over the past few weeks , they got forward in numbers and put the ball exactly where it needed to be when it counted .
bildunterschrift : germany 's second goal settled the contest - argentina never looked like scoring again scary good germany are so locked-in at the moment , even thomas mueller 's slipping to the ground in the midst of the attack that led to the goal was not enough to slow it down .
the ball he fed to lukas podolski was all the more sweet in that he delivered it sitting down .
from then on , argentina were broken .
their defense put in nary a challenge to schweinsteiger as he made his run toward goal on germany 's third in the 74th minute , allowing him to lay off to arne friedrich for a tap-in .
and the fourth , a coast-to coast bum-rush involving just four easy passes , showed there was just one team still on the pitch in the game 's penultimate minute .

and so it was , but few had predicted what a mismatch that would be . on saturday afternoon , germany delighted its fans - and struck a blow for fans of teamwork everywhere - by leveling an argentina side long on reputation and individual skill but short on ideas .
from start to finish , germany 's tactical discipline was miles ahead of argentina , and their combination play created far more goal-scoring chances .
the 4-0 finish was surprising , but richly deserved too .
argentina 's vaunted danger men - lionel messi , carlos tevez , and gonzalo higuain - never got into gear , seeming to have no answer to germany 's dogged defending , and wary of making a mistake that could touch off a german counter .
" our defensive effort was unbelievable , " said germany coach joachim loew after the match .
" messi , and also higuain and tevez were taken out of the game , and we hardly even fouled them .
we tackled at a very high level - exactly what i like to see . "
to be fair , argentina were put on the back foot early , giving up a soft goal in the third minute .
in a sense , this seemed fated .
bildunterschrift : a schweinsteiger cross , a mueller goal , a whole different ballgame the south americans ' defensive frailties had shown up in prior games in this tournament , as when martin demichelis errors gifted goals to south korea and mexico , but in those cases argentina had been cruising to victory and thus went unpunished for their sloppy play .
this time was different .
nicolas otamendi 's lackadaisical marking allowed thomas mueller to break the ice in a game - a costly error , as it turned out .
argentina did take more possession as the first half went on , but never did much with it , probing around the edge of the penalty area to no avail .
germany 's passing on its frequent counter-attacks , meanwhile , was crisp , purposeful , and foreshadowed the goals that would later flood in .
plan b with the likes of messi and tevez making little headway through the middle and higuain starved of service , argentina turned to the flanks .
many of their offensive moves in the latter stages of the first half were played through angel di maria , who took advantage of the space he found out on the wings .
his crosses , however , were not good enough to break the german defense - and the times his play did test german goalkeeper manuel neuer were when he shot from distance .
argentina 's second half started brightly , with the team 's build-up play becoming more energetic and direct , but germany , in its short bursts of possession , still appeared more dangerous .
so while it was against the run of play in possession terms , germany 's second , pivotal goal in the 68th minute did not come as a surprise .
in a move reminiscent of so many we have seen from germany over the past few weeks , they got forward in numbers and put the ball exactly where it needed to be when it counted .
bildunterschrift : germany 's second goal settled the contest - argentina never looked like scoring again scary good germany are so locked-in at the moment , even thomas mueller 's slipping to the ground in the midst of the attack that led to the goal was not enough to slow it down .
the ball he fed to lukas podolski was all the more sweet in that he delivered it sitting down .
from then on , argentina were broken .
their defense put in nary a challenge to schweinsteiger as he made his run toward goal on germany 's third in the 74th minute , allowing him to lay off to arne friedrich for a tap-in .
and the fourth , a coast-to coast bum-rush involving just four easy passes , showed there was just one team still on the pitch in the game 's penultimate minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona admitted his side had been well beaten argentina coach diego maradona looked shell-shocked after the game .
all the freedom he 'd given his stars to create , all the praise he 'd lavished on them had come to naught against a team with a plan , and the men to execute it .
" we studied germany well and defined exactly who was playing where but from the first cross they got a goal and suddenly it was a different match , " said maradona .
" they had more ideas and better control of the ball .
they took advantage of the opportunities they had . "

paraguay sat deep , looking to stifle the european champions spain , who played their characteristically composed , but somehow impotent passing game .
spain were confident in possession , sometimes stringing dozens of uninterrupted passes together , but they crafted few real goal scoring opportunities .
for all spain 's possession , paraguay had the ball in the net shortly before half time , with borussia dortmund 's nelson valdez latching on to a long free-kick . the goal was disallowed , perhaps wrongly , in a borderline offside decision .
bildunterschrift : neither side really pulled in the right direction livelier second half in the second half both sides squandered chances from the penalty spot in the space of a few minutes .
paraguay 's oscar cardozo was pulled down in the box , got back up to take the spot-kick himself , but iker casillas made a fairly comfortable save .
in the very next attack david villa won a penalty for spain .
xavi alonso stepped up and scored , but the shot had to be retaken after spanish players rushed into the area before alonso struck .
at the second attempt alonso 's shot was saved in almost the exact same manner as cardozo 's had been moments earlier .
these misses at least provided a necessary spark to the match , and on 82 minutes david villa finally scored the decisive goal for spain , but even then the ball seemed unwilling to cross the goal line .
andres iniesta put pedro clean through , but the substitute 's shot rebounded off the post .
villa was in the right place at the right time , and side-footed the rebound towards goal .
his shot eventually went in , but only after hitting the inside of both posts .
the final few minutes were a frenetic affair , with chances at both ends and spanish defender sergio ramos taking a nasty kick to the face , but in the end the score remained 1-0 spain .
germany watched with interest as victors , spain will go on to face joachim loew 's german side in the semifinals on wednesday .
german midfielder bastian schweinsteiger magnanimously said he believed spain to be the best team in the world , just after his side had staked a claim to that honor with their 4-0 demolition of many people 's tournament favorites argentina .
he did say , however , that germany had what it takes to beat them .
now he will have his chance to find out whether he 's right .

" even before the game , they 're at it .
the way they gesture , their attempts to influence the referee .
it shows a lack of respect , but that 's just the way the argentines are . "
bastian schweinsteiger , making clear what he thinks of argentina this week .
he also shared his most vivid memory of the game between the two sides at the same quarterfinal stage of the 2006 tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger did n't mince words about argentina " what i remember most is what happened after the game , the brawl which was triggered by the argentinians , " said the germany midfielder .
referring to that fight , captain philipp lahm said he thought its genesis was simple : the argentines " do n't know how to lose . "
the post-match melee meant a suspension for schweinsteiger 's predecessor in germany 's holding midfield role , torsten frings .
the german team went on to lose their next match to italy , and many in germany still feel frings ' absence was decisive in the semi-final defeat .
schweinsteiger said nothing of the kind would happen this time .
" we will not be intimidated or respond to their provocations .
i hope the referee will be watching the game closely , " he said .
returning fire … or holding it ?
having been provoked , the argentina camp wasted little time in firing back - through the ever-passionate carlos tevez .
" i was more afraid of mexico than germany , " tevez told the argentine newspaper clarin .
" the mexicans play better football . "
ouch .
bildunterschrift : just as he was in 2006 , tevez will be a handful for german defenders like arne friedrich other than tevez 's snap , however , the south americans tried to stay low-key .
martin demichelis , who plays in germany for bayern munich , said their recent record against germany does all the talking .
" all the criticisms they make are a sign of respect and nerves .
since we beat them in march , they respect us , " he said .
argentina defeated germany in that recent friendly in munich 1-0 - a score line that flattered the comprehensively beaten hosts .
upon hearing schweinsteiger 's comments , coach diego maradona was even more dismissive .
he said his team " did n't have time to think about schweinsteiger " and ended a television interview by teasing the player .
" what 's the matter with you , schweinsteiger ?
are you getting nervous ? " said the football legend , in a mock-german accent .
switching focus just over 24 hours before the match , however , germany coach joachim loew tried to change the tone of the conversation .
firstly with kindness , as he spoke of his memories of maradona the player he galvanized the whole football world with the way he played .
he was simply magic , " said loew , who never played a starring role on the pitch himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona-fan loew is known for his nose for good football " 1986 and 1990 were the culmination of maradona 's career and he left a mark on football like no other player has ever done before or since . "
he then shared his own thoughts on the post-match fight in 2006 - which he had witnessed as an assistant coach .
" if you ask me , i think that game was at no time brutal or unfair until after the penalties .
it was tightly contested but not marred by unfairness .
the problem in 2006 started after the game had been decided , " said loew .
still , loew said his team would not come out feeling overburdened by the history between the two teams , which includes not just the 2006 brawl but two consecutive world cup finals in 1986 and 1990 , with each side getting the better of the other once .
" we will not be shivering in the changing rooms , hoping the referee wo n't start the game , " said loew .
" in matches like these , " he added , " i do n't really have to help the players with any motivational tricks . "

in front of more than 1,000 cheering onlookers at a packed concert hall in the capital bishkek , otunbayeva somberly took her oath and promised a new political era for crisis-ridden kyrgyzstan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic violence has died down since erupting in april " as president , i will spare no effort to create a new political culture for the country based on a strict adherence to the rule of law , " she told the assembled crowd .
" i must be principled and consistently make demands on all branches of government to ensure it .
the new policy can not be built on fantasies and illusions .
it must be real and effective . "
inauguration comes at delicate moment otunbayeva takes over the government as kyrgyzstan has been wracked by violence and political instability .
thousands have died in ethnic violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks since then-president kurmanbek bakiyev was removed from power in a bloody coup in april .
at least 75,000 people fled to neighboring uzbekistan , leading international aid agencies to warn of an impending humanitarian crisis in dealing with the thousands of families left homeless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of thousands remain homeless in the south the inauguration comes just days after the country overwhelmingly approved a new constitution that will make kyrgyzstan the region 's first parliamentary democracy , a move the government hopes will bring a measure of stability .
the new constitution slashes the powers of the president and sets the stage for parliamentary elections that authorities have scheduled for early october to bring in a permanent government .
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , has questioned the feasibility of kyrgyzstan 's aspirations for a parliamentary democracy , warning that it could lead to further instability in the country and the region .
he said last week on the sidelines of the g20 summit in toronto that a lack of autocratic rule in kyrgyzstan could result in a " relapse into factionalism , " giving rise to a " breeding ground for islamist extremism . "

in a film circulated on the video-sharing website youtube , former tour de france cyclist davide cassani reveals this new form of cheating - riding bikes that are , in fact , motorbikes in disguise .
" these machines have been around since 2004 and they have been used in races by professional cyclists , " cassani told france 's rtl radio .
" there are a lot of benefits using such a bike .
you can reach 50 kilometers an hour .
it has its motor in the frame and a battery between the pedals , " he explains .
suspicious bike swap the italian tv corporation rai has alleged that cancellara swapped bikes suspiciously during the recent paris-roubaix race before going on to victory .
the rider , however , insists the suggestion he used mechanical doping is ridiculous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's fabian cancellara has been linked with mechanical doping but the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- is erring on the side of caution - on june 18 it announced it would tighten its bike checking procedures by introducing a new type of scanner .
" from now on , race service will be subject to stricter regulation in order to ensure that only equipment that has been checked at the start or finish can be used during competitions , " the uci said in a statement .
doping scandals meanwhile , drugs doping is once again casting a shadow over the tour .
italian rider riccardo ricco tested positive three days before the off and doping revelations from former rider floyd landis have implicated seven-time winner lance armstrong , who is taking part in what he says will be his last tour this year .
ricco was handed a two-month suspended jail sentence and a 3,000 euro fine for doping during the 2008 tour de france by a french court on tuesday .
the tour 's organizers insist , however , that it is now harder than ever to cheat .
" considerable progress has been made these past two years , " says christian prudhomme , director of the tour de france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's ricco was handed a suspended sentence for doping during the 2008 tour " now cyclists have to report where they are morning , noon and night every day of the tour .
they also have to carry a biological passport which is designed to root out not only cheats who test positively in traditional tests but those who do n't but whose blood changes its composition suspiciously over time , " he explains .
riders are also subjected to surprise tests before and during the tour .
criticism from the anti-doping agency the french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- , which this year will not be taking part in the drug control process , says that relying on biological passports alone is dangerous .
the afld says additional information from customs authorities and police investigations is needed in the fight against doping .
it also accused the icu of giving preferential treatment to riders such as lance armstrong and last year 's winner alberto contador when it came to surprise testing .
the icu and the afld have a long history of clashes .

" even before the game , they 're at it .
the way they gesture , their attempts to influence the referee .
it shows a lack of respect , but that 's just the way the argentines are . "
bastian schweinsteiger , making clear what he thinks of argentina this week .
he also shared his most vivid memory of the game between the two sides at the same quarterfinal stage of the 2006 tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger did n't mince words about argentina " what i remember most is what happened after the game , the brawl which was triggered by the argentinians , " said the germany midfielder .
referring to that fight , captain philipp lahm said he thought its genesis was simple : the argentines " do n't know how to lose . "
the post-match melee meant a suspension for schweinsteiger 's predecessor in germany 's holding midfield role , torsten frings .
the german team went on to lose their next match to italy , and many in germany still feel frings ' absence was decisive in the semi-final defeat .
schweinsteiger said nothing of the kind would happen this time .
" we will not be intimidated or respond to their provocations .
i hope the referee will be watching the game closely , " he said .
returning fire … or holding it ?
having been provoked , the argentina camp wasted little time in firing back - through the ever-passionate carlos tevez .
" i was more afraid of mexico than germany , " tevez told the argentine newspaper clarin .
" the mexicans play better football . "
ouch .
bildunterschrift : just as he was in 2006 , tevez will be a handful for german defenders like arne friedrich other than tevez 's snap , however , the south americans tried to stay low-key .
martin demichelis , who plays in germany for bayern munich , said their recent record against germany does all the talking .
" all the criticisms they make are a sign of respect and nerves .
since we beat them in march , they respect us , " he said .
argentina defeated germany in that recent friendly in munich 1-0 - a score line that flattered the comprehensively beaten hosts .
upon hearing schweinsteiger 's comments , coach diego maradona was even more dismissive .
he said his team " did n't have time to think about schweinsteiger " and ended a television interview by teasing the player .
" what 's the matter with you , schweinsteiger ?
are you getting nervous ? " said the football legend , in a mock-german accent .
switching focus just over 24 hours before the match , however , germany coach joachim loew tried to change the tone of the conversation .
firstly with kindness , as he spoke of his memories of maradona the player he galvanized the whole football world with the way he played .
he was simply magic , " said loew , who never played a starring role on the pitch himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona-fan loew is known for his nose for good football " 1986 and 1990 were the culmination of maradona 's career and he left a mark on football like no other player has ever done before or since . "
he then shared his own thoughts on the post-match fight in 2006 - which he had witnessed as an assistant coach .
" if you ask me , i think that game was at no time brutal or unfair until after the penalties .
it was tightly contested but not marred by unfairness .
the problem in 2006 started after the game had been decided , " said loew .
still , loew said his team would not come out feeling overburdened by the history between the two teams , which includes not just the 2006 brawl but two consecutive world cup finals in 1986 and 1990 , with each side getting the better of the other once .
" we will not be shivering in the changing rooms , hoping the referee wo n't start the game , " said loew .
" in matches like these , " he added , " i do n't really have to help the players with any motivational tricks . "

in front of more than 1,000 cheering onlookers at a packed concert hall in the capital bishkek , otunbayeva somberly took her oath and promised a new political era for crisis-ridden kyrgyzstan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic violence has died down since erupting in april " as president , i will spare no effort to create a new political culture for the country based on a strict adherence to the rule of law , " she told the assembled crowd .
" i must be principled and consistently make demands on all branches of government to ensure it .
the new policy can not be built on fantasies and illusions .
it must be real and effective . "
inauguration comes at delicate moment otunbayeva takes over the government as kyrgyzstan has been wracked by violence and political instability .
thousands have died in ethnic violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks since then-president kurmanbek bakiyev was removed from power in a bloody coup in april .
at least 75,000 people fled to neighboring uzbekistan , leading international aid agencies to warn of an impending humanitarian crisis in dealing with the thousands of families left homeless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of thousands remain homeless in the south the inauguration comes just days after the country overwhelmingly approved a new constitution that will make kyrgyzstan the region 's first parliamentary democracy , a move the government hopes will bring a measure of stability .
the new constitution slashes the powers of the president and sets the stage for parliamentary elections that authorities have scheduled for early october to bring in a permanent government .
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , has questioned the feasibility of kyrgyzstan 's aspirations for a parliamentary democracy , warning that it could lead to further instability in the country and the region .
he said last week on the sidelines of the g20 summit in toronto that a lack of autocratic rule in kyrgyzstan could result in a " relapse into factionalism , " giving rise to a " breeding ground for islamist extremism . "

spain will face germany in the semis , after jogi loew 's men thrashed argentina . the match between spain and paraguay was a comparatively stale one , after germany 's up-tempo drubbing of argentina earlier on saturday .
david villa scored for the spaniards late on , but it was a tough route towards the semifinal for his side .
paraguay sat deep , looking to stifle the european champions spain , who played their characteristically composed , but somehow impotent passing game .
spain were confident in possession , sometimes stringing dozens of uninterrupted passes together , but they crafted few real goal scoring opportunities .
for all spain 's possession , paraguay had the ball in the net shortly before half time , with borussia dortmund 's nelson valdez latching on to a long free-kick . the goal was disallowed , perhaps wrongly , in a borderline offside decision .
bildunterschrift : neither side really pulled in the right direction livelier second half in the second half both sides squandered chances from the penalty spot in the space of a few minutes .
paraguay 's oscar cardozo was pulled down in the box , got back up to take the spot-kick himself , but iker casillas made a fairly comfortable save .
in the very next attack david villa won a penalty for spain .
xavi alonso stepped up and scored , but the shot had to be retaken after spanish players rushed into the area before alonso struck .
at the second attempt alonso 's shot was saved in almost the exact same manner as cardozo 's had been moments earlier .
these misses at least provided a necessary spark to the match , and on 82 minutes david villa finally scored the decisive goal for spain , but even then the ball seemed unwilling to cross the goal line .
andres iniesta put pedro clean through , but the substitute 's shot rebounded off the post .
villa was in the right place at the right time , and side-footed the rebound towards goal .
his shot eventually went in , but only after hitting the inside of both posts .
the final few minutes were a frenetic affair , with chances at both ends and spanish defender sergio ramos taking a nasty kick to the face , but in the end the score remained 1-0 spain .
germany watched with interest as victors , spain will go on to face joachim loew 's german side in the semifinals on wednesday .
german midfielder bastian schweinsteiger magnanimously said he believed spain to be the best team in the world , just after his side had staked a claim to that honor with their 4-0 demolition of many people 's tournament favorites argentina .
he did say , however , that germany had what it takes to beat them .
now he will have his chance to find out whether he 's right .

miroslav klose scored twice , along with goals from thomas mueller and defender arne friedrich . germany have scored four goals for the third time in the world cup , this time dispatching argentina with shocking ease in the quarterfinal .
" now we 're among the best four teams in the world , and that 's exactly where this team belongs , " coach joachim loew said after the game .
" our destiny is in our own hands now , we can achieve something really great here . "
bildunterschrift : coach joachim loew , center , had every reason to cheer as his side banged in four goals - again the germans got off to a flying start , scoring the quickest goal of the world cup this year against a shocked argentina backline , with thomas mueller heading home a free-kick in just the third minute .
the 20-year-old mueller , who was a two-goal hero against england in the previous round , has now scored four in the competition from his position on the right flank .
" it 's insane , after thrashing argentina 4-0 , i 'm almost lost for words , " mueller told reporters after the match .
" the star today , once again , was the team as a whole . "
mueller , however , will play no part in the semifinal .
the bayern munich man picked up his second yellow card of the competition from a handball call that was more than a bit questionable by the referee , meaning he will serve a one-match ban .
" i hope that my teammates get everything right in the semifnal , then i can come back and score another goal in the final , " the upbeat youngster concluded .
scorer turns provider despite this setback , mueller remained a key man going forward for joachim loew 's men , and displayed fantastic determination and awareness in the build up for germany 's second goal .
even after losing his footing , a seated mueller played a great through-ball for lukas podolski on the left wing , who delivered the perfect cross to miroslav klose in front of goal .
after argentine goalie sergio romero dived for the cross and missed , klose simply had to tap the ball into an open net .
moments later arne friedrich - pushing forward from the center of defense - put the finishing touches on a great cross from bastian schweinsteiger to make it 3-0 germany with just a quarter of an hour to play .
closing in on the record bildunterschrift : miroslav klose , left , only needs two more goals to become the world cup 's deadliest ever striker in the dying minutes , with argentina clearly broken , germany made it four , again through miroslav klose .
the veteran 's 100th game for his country could hardly have been scripted better .
with his second-half brace , the frontman grabbed his 13th and 14th career world cup goals , meaning he is now level with legendary striker gerd mueller as the most prolific german in world cup history .
he only needs one more to tie the overall record of 15 goals , held by the brazilian goal-machine ronaldo .
schweinsteiger shines holding midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who has excelled while filling the boots of injured german captain michael ballack during the competition , was awarded man of the match for his performance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael who ?
schweinsteiger has replaced ballack in style schweinsteiger set up germany 's first and third goals , but his most crucial contribution was controlling the game in the middle of the park from start to finish .
" we may have to play spain next , " the man of the match cautioned after the victory .
" they 're the best team in the world , in my view .
but we 're good enough , we believe in ourselves . "
germany will now face either european champions spain or paraguay , who play on saturday evening , in the semifinals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de drugs -pipe- 03.07.2010 ' mechanical doping ' mars start of tour de france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : using motorized bikes is said to be the latest form of doping as the 97th tour de france gets underway in rotterdam in the netherlands this saturday , bikes are to be scanned for illegal motors , a practice that has been dubbed mechanical doping . bikes used at the tour de france , which starts in rotterdam this saturday and ends in paris on july 25 , will be scanned for illegal motors , following rumors that swiss rider fabian cancellara used so-called mechanical doping in the tour of flanders and the paris-roubaix .
in a film circulated on the video-sharing website youtube , former tour de france cyclist davide cassani reveals this new form of cheating - riding bikes that are , in fact , motorbikes in disguise .
" these machines have been around since 2004 and they have been used in races by professional cyclists , " cassani told france 's rtl radio .
" there are a lot of benefits using such a bike .
you can reach 50 kilometers an hour .
it has its motor in the frame and a battery between the pedals , " he explains .
suspicious bike swap the italian tv corporation rai has alleged that cancellara swapped bikes suspiciously during the recent paris-roubaix race before going on to victory .
the rider , however , insists the suggestion he used mechanical doping is ridiculous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's fabian cancellara has been linked with mechanical doping but the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- is erring on the side of caution - on june 18 it announced it would tighten its bike checking procedures by introducing a new type of scanner .
" from now on , race service will be subject to stricter regulation in order to ensure that only equipment that has been checked at the start or finish can be used during competitions , " the uci said in a statement .
doping scandals meanwhile , drugs doping is once again casting a shadow over the tour .
italian rider riccardo ricco tested positive three days before the off and doping revelations from former rider floyd landis have implicated seven-time winner lance armstrong , who is taking part in what he says will be his last tour this year .
ricco was handed a two-month suspended jail sentence and a 3,000 euro fine for doping during the 2008 tour de france by a french court on tuesday .
the tour 's organizers insist , however , that it is now harder than ever to cheat .
" considerable progress has been made these past two years , " says christian prudhomme , director of the tour de france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's ricco was handed a suspended sentence for doping during the 2008 tour " now cyclists have to report where they are morning , noon and night every day of the tour .
they also have to carry a biological passport which is designed to root out not only cheats who test positively in traditional tests but those who do n't but whose blood changes its composition suspiciously over time , " he explains .
riders are also subjected to surprise tests before and during the tour .
criticism from the anti-doping agency the french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- , which this year will not be taking part in the drug control process , says that relying on biological passports alone is dangerous .
the afld says additional information from customs authorities and police investigations is needed in the fight against doping .
it also accused the icu of giving preferential treatment to riders such as lance armstrong and last year 's winner alberto contador when it came to surprise testing .
the icu and the afld have a long history of clashes .
in 2009 , they worked together during the tour de france , but the partnership was a failure , according to afld president pierre bordry , who said it would have been impossible to renew the partnership this year .

" even before the game , they 're at it .
the way they gesture , their attempts to influence the referee .
it shows a lack of respect , but that 's just the way the argentines are . "
bastian schweinsteiger , making clear what he thinks of argentina this week .
he also shared his most vivid memory of the game between the two sides at the same quarterfinal stage of the 2006 tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger did n't mince words about argentina " what i remember most is what happened after the game , the brawl which was triggered by the argentinians , " said the germany midfielder .
referring to that fight , captain philipp lahm said he thought its genesis was simple : the argentines " do n't know how to lose . "
the post-match melee meant a suspension for schweinsteiger 's predecessor in germany 's holding midfield role , torsten frings .
the german team went on to lose their next match to italy , and many in germany still feel frings ' absence was decisive in the semi-final defeat .
schweinsteiger said nothing of the kind would happen this time .
" we will not be intimidated or respond to their provocations .
i hope the referee will be watching the game closely , " he said .
returning fire … or holding it ?
having been provoked , the argentina camp wasted little time in firing back - through the ever-passionate carlos tevez .
" i was more afraid of mexico than germany , " tevez told the argentine newspaper clarin .
" the mexicans play better football . "
ouch .
bildunterschrift : just as he was in 2006 , tevez will be a handful for german defenders like arne friedrich other than tevez 's snap , however , the south americans tried to stay low-key .
martin demichelis , who plays in germany for bayern munich , said their recent record against germany does all the talking .
" all the criticisms they make are a sign of respect and nerves .
since we beat them in march , they respect us , " he said .
argentina defeated germany in that recent friendly in munich 1-0 - a score line that flattered the comprehensively beaten hosts .
upon hearing schweinsteiger 's comments , coach diego maradona was even more dismissive .
he said his team " did n't have time to think about schweinsteiger " and ended a television interview by teasing the player .
" what 's the matter with you , schweinsteiger ?
are you getting nervous ? " said the football legend , in a mock-german accent .
switching focus just over 24 hours before the match , however , germany coach joachim loew tried to change the tone of the conversation .
firstly with kindness , as he spoke of his memories of maradona the player he galvanized the whole football world with the way he played .
he was simply magic , " said loew , who never played a starring role on the pitch himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona-fan loew is known for his nose for good football " 1986 and 1990 were the culmination of maradona 's career and he left a mark on football like no other player has ever done before or since . "
he then shared his own thoughts on the post-match fight in 2006 - which he had witnessed as an assistant coach .
" if you ask me , i think that game was at no time brutal or unfair until after the penalties .
it was tightly contested but not marred by unfairness .
the problem in 2006 started after the game had been decided , " said loew .
still , loew said his team would not come out feeling overburdened by the history between the two teams , which includes not just the 2006 brawl but two consecutive world cup finals in 1986 and 1990 , with each side getting the better of the other once .
" we will not be shivering in the changing rooms , hoping the referee wo n't start the game , " said loew .
" in matches like these , " he added , " i do n't really have to help the players with any motivational tricks . "

" even before the game , they 're at it .
the way they gesture , their attempts to influence the referee .
it shows a lack of respect , but that 's just the way the argentines are . "
bastian schweinsteiger , making clear what he thinks of argentina this week .
he also shared his most vivid memory of the game between the two sides at the same quarterfinal stage of the 2006 tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger did n't mince words about argentina " what i remember most is what happened after the game , the brawl which was triggered by the argentinians , " said the germany midfielder .
referring to that fight , captain philipp lahm said he thought its genesis was simple : the argentines " do n't know how to lose . "
the post-match melee meant a suspension for schweinsteiger 's predecessor in germany 's holding midfield role , torsten frings .
the german team went on to lose their next match to italy , and many in germany still feel frings ' absence was decisive in the semi-final defeat .
schweinsteiger said nothing of the kind would happen this time .
" we will not be intimidated or respond to their provocations .
i hope the referee will be watching the game closely , " he said .
returning fire … or holding it ?
having been provoked , the argentina camp wasted little time in firing back - through the ever-passionate carlos tevez .
" i was more afraid of mexico than germany , " tevez told the argentine newspaper clarin .
" the mexicans play better football . "
ouch .
bildunterschrift : just as he was in 2006 , tevez will be a handful for german defenders like arne friedrich other than tevez 's snap , however , the south americans tried to stay low-key .
martin demichelis , who plays in germany for bayern munich , said their recent record against germany does all the talking .
" all the criticisms they make are a sign of respect and nerves .
since we beat them in march , they respect us , " he said .
argentina defeated germany in that recent friendly in munich 1-0 - a score line that flattered the comprehensively beaten hosts .
upon hearing schweinsteiger 's comments , coach diego maradona was even more dismissive .
he said his team " did n't have time to think about schweinsteiger " and ended a television interview by teasing the player .
" what 's the matter with you , schweinsteiger ?
are you getting nervous ? " said the football legend , in a mock-german accent .
switching focus just over 24 hours before the match , however , germany coach joachim loew tried to change the tone of the conversation .
firstly with kindness , as he spoke of his memories of maradona the player he galvanized the whole football world with the way he played .
he was simply magic , " said loew , who never played a starring role on the pitch himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona-fan loew is known for his nose for good football " 1986 and 1990 were the culmination of maradona 's career and he left a mark on football like no other player has ever done before or since . "
he then shared his own thoughts on the post-match fight in 2006 - which he had witnessed as an assistant coach .
" if you ask me , i think that game was at no time brutal or unfair until after the penalties .
it was tightly contested but not marred by unfairness .
the problem in 2006 started after the game had been decided , " said loew .
still , loew said his team would not come out feeling overburdened by the history between the two teams , which includes not just the 2006 brawl but two consecutive world cup finals in 1986 and 1990 , with each side getting the better of the other once .
" we will not be shivering in the changing rooms , hoping the referee wo n't start the game , " said loew .
" in matches like these , " he added , " i do n't really have to help the players with any motivational tricks . "

in a film circulated on the video-sharing website youtube , former tour de france cyclist davide cassani reveals this new form of cheating - riding bikes that are , in fact , motorbikes in disguise .
" these machines have been around since 2004 and they have been used in races by professional cyclists , " cassani told france 's rtl radio .
" there are a lot of benefits using such a bike .
you can reach 50 kilometers an hour .
it has its motor in the frame and a battery between the pedals , " he explains .

" from now on , race service will be subject to stricter regulation in order to ensure that only equipment that has been checked at the start or finish can be used during competitions , " the uci said in a statement .
doping scandals meanwhile , drugs doping is once again casting a shadow over the tour .
italian rider riccardo ricco tested positive three days before the off and doping revelations from former rider floyd landis have implicated seven-time winner lance armstrong , who is taking part in what he says will be his last tour this year .
ricco was handed a two-month suspended jail sentence and a 3,000 euro fine for doping during the 2008 tour de france by a french court on tuesday .
the tour 's organizers insist , however , that it is now harder than ever to cheat .
" considerable progress has been made these past two years , " says christian prudhomme , director of the tour de france .

they also have to carry a biological passport which is designed to root out not only cheats who test positively in traditional tests but those who do n't but whose blood changes its composition suspiciously over time , " he explains .
riders are also subjected to surprise tests before and during the tour .
criticism from the anti-doping agency the french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- , which this year will not be taking part in the drug control process , says that relying on biological passports alone is dangerous .
the afld says additional information from customs authorities and police investigations is needed in the fight against doping .
it also accused the icu of giving preferential treatment to riders such as lance armstrong and last year 's winner alberto contador when it came to surprise testing .
the icu and the afld have a long history of clashes .
in 2009 , they worked together during the tour de france , but the partnership was a failure , according to afld president pierre bordry , who said it would have been impossible to renew the partnership this year .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's fabian cancellara has been linked with mechanical doping but the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- is erring on the side of caution - on june 18 it announced it would tighten its bike checking procedures by introducing a new type of scanner .
" from now on , race service will be subject to stricter regulation in order to ensure that only equipment that has been checked at the start or finish can be used during competitions , " the uci said in a statement .
doping scandals meanwhile , drugs doping is once again casting a shadow over the tour .
italian rider riccardo ricco tested positive three days before the off and doping revelations from former rider floyd landis have implicated seven-time winner lance armstrong , who is taking part in what he says will be his last tour this year .
ricco was handed a two-month suspended jail sentence and a 3,000 euro fine for doping during the 2008 tour de france by a french court on tuesday .
the tour 's organizers insist , however , that it is now harder than ever to cheat .
" considerable progress has been made these past two years , " says christian prudhomme , director of the tour de france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's ricco was handed a suspended sentence for doping during the 2008 tour " now cyclists have to report where they are morning , noon and night every day of the tour .
they also have to carry a biological passport which is designed to root out not only cheats who test positively in traditional tests but those who do n't but whose blood changes its composition suspiciously over time , " he explains .
riders are also subjected to surprise tests before and during the tour .
criticism from the anti-doping agency the french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- , which this year will not be taking part in the drug control process , says that relying on biological passports alone is dangerous .
the afld says additional information from customs authorities and police investigations is needed in the fight against doping .
it also accused the icu of giving preferential treatment to riders such as lance armstrong and last year 's winner alberto contador when it came to surprise testing .
the icu and the afld have a long history of clashes .
in 2009 , they worked together during the tour de france , but the partnership was a failure , according to afld president pierre bordry , who said it would have been impossible to renew the partnership this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 03.07.2010 online giant amazon enters the grocery business in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon started selling books , but has gone far beyond that amazon has begun selling food , including fresh products , to consumers in germany .
the us company hopes to succeed in a market where numerous german food retailers and internet startups so far have struggled - or failed . consumers in germany can now turn to amazon to purchase not only books , movies and other popular merchandise but also groceries , including fresh fruit , vegetables and meat .
the new online offering covers more than 35,000 products .
most of them are supplied by a network of more than 60 suppliers , including froodies , gourmantis and moevenpick .
same-day delivery delivery for edibles is the same as amazon 's normal service in germany , which is free for purchases above 20 euros .
and , initially in berlin and frankfurt , the company guarantees same-day delivery for orders made before 11 am .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is hoping that convenience will spur people to buy food online amazon has been selling a range of food products in the united states since 2006 , adding perishables like grapes and steaks a couple years ago .
but online food sales have been anything but easy .
prior to the launch of its own online grocery offer , the company made numerous investments in web-to-doorstep grocery delivery ventures in the us during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s .
homegrocer.com , kozo.com and webvan were among them .
all failed , largely due to the need to build up a massive logistical infrastructure .
short distances to stores since then , amazon claims it has learned to work with regional partners to overcome challenges such as sourcing local products and providing an uncomplicated delivery infrastructure .
this regional partnership model is what the company hopes to transplant successfully in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edeka is one of several big german supermarkets to test the waters for online food sales like the us , germany has seen its fair share of online grocers come and go .
" all of the big food retailers in germany , like edeka , real and rewe , have launched online delivery services , then discontinued them only to try again , but so far without huge success , " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert told deutsche welle .
" germany is a country of short distances to stores .
people are simply used to going to stores to buy their groceries . "
online food sales in germany , according to wolfgang adelwarth at market-research company gfk , account for less than 1 percent of the country 's 150-billion-plus grocery market .
trend toward convenience " i see a very limited market for online food sales , " adelwarth told deutsche welle .
" there is a market for speciality products , like wine , and there is a group of young professionals who are too busy too shop in stores , but beyond that i do n't see huge demand in germany . "
still , eggert points to a trend toward convenience among german consumers , both young and old , that could spur online food sales .
but a successful online grocery delivery service in the country , he warns , will not come quickly or cheaply .
" it will take time and money , which amazon has , " eggert said .
" the company clearly sees an opportunity . "

" it will take time and money , which amazon has , " eggert said .

miroslav klose scored twice , along with goals from thomas mueller and defender arne friedrich . germany have scored four goals for the third time in the world cup , this time dispatching argentina with shocking ease in the quarterfinal .
" now we 're among the best four teams in the world , and that 's exactly where this team belongs , " coach joachim loew said after the game .
" our destiny is in our own hands now , we can achieve something really great here . "
bildunterschrift : coach joachim loew , center , had every reason to cheer as his side banged in four goals - again the germans got off to a flying start , scoring the quickest goal of the world cup this year against a shocked argentina backline , with thomas mueller heading home a free-kick in just the third minute .
the 20-year-old mueller , who was a two-goal hero against england in the previous round , has now scored four in the competition from his position on the right flank .
" it 's insane , after thrashing argentina 4-0 , i 'm almost lost for words , " mueller told reporters after the match .
" the star today , once again , was the team as a whole . "
mueller , however , will play no part in the semifinal .
the bayern munich man picked up his second yellow card of the competition from a handball call that was more than a bit questionable by the referee , meaning he will serve a one-match ban .
" i hope that my teammates get everything right in the semifnal , then i can come back and score another goal in the final , " the upbeat youngster concluded .
scorer turns provider despite this setback , mueller remained a key man going forward for joachim loew 's men , and displayed fantastic determination and awareness in the build up for germany 's second goal .
even after losing his footing , a seated mueller played a great through-ball for lukas podolski on the left wing , who delivered the perfect cross to miroslav klose in front of goal .
after argentine goalie sergio romero dived for the cross and missed , klose simply had to tap the ball into an open net .
moments later arne friedrich - pushing forward from the center of defense - put the finishing touches on a great cross from bastian schweinsteiger to make it 3-0 germany with just a quarter of an hour to play .
closing in on the record bildunterschrift : miroslav klose , left , only needs two more goals to become the world cup 's deadliest ever striker in the dying minutes , with argentina clearly broken , germany made it four , again through miroslav klose .
the veteran 's 100th game for his country could hardly have been scripted better .
with his second-half brace , the frontman grabbed his 13th and 14th career world cup goals , meaning he is now level with legendary striker gerd mueller as the most prolific german in world cup history .
he only needs one more to tie the overall record of 15 goals , held by the brazilian goal-machine ronaldo .
schweinsteiger shines holding midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who has excelled while filling the boots of injured german captain michael ballack during the competition , was awarded man of the match for his performance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael who ?
schweinsteiger has replaced ballack in style schweinsteiger set up germany 's first and third goals , but his most crucial contribution was controlling the game in the middle of the park from start to finish .
" we may have to play spain next , " the man of the match cautioned after the victory .
" they 're the best team in the world , in my view .
but we 're good enough , we believe in ourselves . "
germany will now face either european champions spain or paraguay , who play on saturday evening , in the semifinals .

" we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .
" these children then go to hamas 's koran schools , " she said , adding that the blockade could thus only fuel radical islamism . an end to isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will not apologize for raiding aid ships social democrat mp rolf muetzenich supports mueller 's criticism of the blockade .
muetzenich has called for not only humanitarian aid to gaza , but support to help the region rebuild itself economically and end its political isolation . " we must promote the message among the palestinian fractions that only a government of national unity will allow for an ongoing and just peace solution in palestine - and then be of benefit to israel , " he said . all bundestag fractions agreed that an end to the blockade would indeed benefit israel .
" yet we must not lose sight of israel 's security needs , " said christian democrat philipp missfelder - to the applause of the house . author : bettina marx / dl -lrb- dpa -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch world cup -pipe- 03.07.2010 spain finally eke out a win over paraguay , with germany waiting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : villa 's late goal rescued the spaniards from extra time it took the european champions 82 rather unconvincing minutes , but spain finally managed to put one past a resilient paraguayan defense .
spain will face germany in the semis , after jogi loew 's men thrashed argentina . the match between spain and paraguay was a comparatively stale one , after germany 's up-tempo drubbing of argentina earlier on saturday .
david villa scored for the spaniards late on , but it was a tough route towards the semifinal for his side .
paraguay sat deep , looking to stifle the european champions spain , who played their characteristically composed , but somehow impotent passing game .
spain were confident in possession , sometimes stringing dozens of uninterrupted passes together , but they crafted few real goal scoring opportunities .
for all spain 's possession , paraguay had the ball in the net shortly before half time , with borussia dortmund 's nelson valdez latching on to a long free-kick . the goal was disallowed , perhaps wrongly , in a borderline offside decision .
bildunterschrift : neither side really pulled in the right direction livelier second half in the second half both sides squandered chances from the penalty spot in the space of a few minutes .
paraguay 's oscar cardozo was pulled down in the box , got back up to take the spot-kick himself , but iker casillas made a fairly comfortable save .
in the very next attack david villa won a penalty for spain .
xavi alonso stepped up and scored , but the shot had to be retaken after spanish players rushed into the area before alonso struck .
at the second attempt alonso 's shot was saved in almost the exact same manner as cardozo 's had been moments earlier .
these misses at least provided a necessary spark to the match , and on 82 minutes david villa finally scored the decisive goal for spain , but even then the ball seemed unwilling to cross the goal line .
andres iniesta put pedro clean through , but the substitute 's shot rebounded off the post .
villa was in the right place at the right time , and side-footed the rebound towards goal .
his shot eventually went in , but only after hitting the inside of both posts .
the final few minutes were a frenetic affair , with chances at both ends and spanish defender sergio ramos taking a nasty kick to the face , but in the end the score remained 1-0 spain .
germany watched with interest as victors , spain will go on to face joachim loew 's german side in the semifinals on wednesday .
german midfielder bastian schweinsteiger magnanimously said he believed spain to be the best team in the world , just after his side had staked a claim to that honor with their 4-0 demolition of many people 's tournament favorites argentina .
he did say , however , that germany had what it takes to beat them .
now he will have his chance to find out whether he 's right .

bastian schweinsteiger , making clear what he thinks of argentina this week .
he also shared his most vivid memory of the game between the two sides at the same quarterfinal stage of the 2006 tournament .

referring to that fight , captain philipp lahm said he thought its genesis was simple : the argentines " do n't know how to lose . "

" we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 fifa world cup spain , netherlands , germany dominate dw top xi spain 's world cup win down to possession , not goals youthful germany hold heads high and look to future spanish enjoy football fiesta after victory over devastated dutch world cup -pipe- 03.07.2010 germany swamp argentina as maradona 's stars wilt in the spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina dug the ball out of their own net time and again the game was billed as a match-up of argentina 's offensive superstars versus germany 's scrappy collection of well-organized youngsters .
and so it was , but few had predicted what a mismatch that would be . on saturday afternoon , germany delighted its fans - and struck a blow for fans of teamwork everywhere - by leveling an argentina side long on reputation and individual skill but short on ideas .
from start to finish , germany 's tactical discipline was miles ahead of argentina , and their combination play created far more goal-scoring chances .
the 4-0 finish was surprising , but richly deserved too .
argentina 's vaunted danger men - lionel messi , carlos tevez , and gonzalo higuain - never got into gear , seeming to have no answer to germany 's dogged defending , and wary of making a mistake that could touch off a german counter .
" our defensive effort was unbelievable , " said germany coach joachim loew after the match .
" messi , and also higuain and tevez were taken out of the game , and we hardly even fouled them .
we tackled at a very high level - exactly what i like to see . "
to be fair , argentina were put on the back foot early , giving up a soft goal in the third minute .
in a sense , this seemed fated .
bildunterschrift : a schweinsteiger cross , a mueller goal , a whole different ballgame the south americans ' defensive frailties had shown up in prior games in this tournament , as when martin demichelis errors gifted goals to south korea and mexico , but in those cases argentina had been cruising to victory and thus went unpunished for their sloppy play .
this time was different .
nicolas otamendi 's lackadaisical marking allowed thomas mueller to break the ice in a game - a costly error , as it turned out .
argentina did take more possession as the first half went on , but never did much with it , probing around the edge of the penalty area to no avail .
germany 's passing on its frequent counter-attacks , meanwhile , was crisp , purposeful , and foreshadowed the goals that would later flood in .
plan b with the likes of messi and tevez making little headway through the middle and higuain starved of service , argentina turned to the flanks .
many of their offensive moves in the latter stages of the first half were played through angel di maria , who took advantage of the space he found out on the wings .
his crosses , however , were not good enough to break the german defense - and the times his play did test german goalkeeper manuel neuer were when he shot from distance .
argentina 's second half started brightly , with the team 's build-up play becoming more energetic and direct , but germany , in its short bursts of possession , still appeared more dangerous .
so while it was against the run of play in possession terms , germany 's second , pivotal goal in the 68th minute did not come as a surprise .
in a move reminiscent of so many we have seen from germany over the past few weeks , they got forward in numbers and put the ball exactly where it needed to be when it counted .
bildunterschrift : germany 's second goal settled the contest - argentina never looked like scoring again scary good germany are so locked-in at the moment , even thomas mueller 's slipping to the ground in the midst of the attack that led to the goal was not enough to slow it down .
the ball he fed to lukas podolski was all the more sweet in that he delivered it sitting down .
from then on , argentina were broken .
their defense put in nary a challenge to schweinsteiger as he made his run toward goal on germany 's third in the 74th minute , allowing him to lay off to arne friedrich for a tap-in .
and the fourth , a coast-to coast bum-rush involving just four easy passes , showed there was just one team still on the pitch in the game 's penultimate minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona admitted his side had been well beaten argentina coach diego maradona looked shell-shocked after the game .
all the freedom he 'd given his stars to create , all the praise he 'd lavished on them had come to naught against a team with a plan , and the men to execute it .
" we studied germany well and defined exactly who was playing where but from the first cross they got a goal and suddenly it was a different match , " said maradona .
" they had more ideas and better control of the ball .

and so it was , but few had predicted what a mismatch that would be . on saturday afternoon , germany delighted its fans - and struck a blow for fans of teamwork everywhere - by leveling an argentina side long on reputation and individual skill but short on ideas .
from start to finish , germany 's tactical discipline was miles ahead of argentina , and their combination play created far more goal-scoring chances .
the 4-0 finish was surprising , but richly deserved too .
argentina 's vaunted danger men - lionel messi , carlos tevez , and gonzalo higuain - never got into gear , seeming to have no answer to germany 's dogged defending , and wary of making a mistake that could touch off a german counter .
" our defensive effort was unbelievable , " said germany coach joachim loew after the match .
" messi , and also higuain and tevez were taken out of the game , and we hardly even fouled them .
we tackled at a very high level - exactly what i like to see . "
to be fair , argentina were put on the back foot early , giving up a soft goal in the third minute .
in a sense , this seemed fated .
bildunterschrift : a schweinsteiger cross , a mueller goal , a whole different ballgame the south americans ' defensive frailties had shown up in prior games in this tournament , as when martin demichelis errors gifted goals to south korea and mexico , but in those cases argentina had been cruising to victory and thus went unpunished for their sloppy play .
this time was different .
nicolas otamendi 's lackadaisical marking allowed thomas mueller to break the ice in a game - a costly error , as it turned out .
argentina did take more possession as the first half went on , but never did much with it , probing around the edge of the penalty area to no avail .
germany 's passing on its frequent counter-attacks , meanwhile , was crisp , purposeful , and foreshadowed the goals that would later flood in .
plan b with the likes of messi and tevez making little headway through the middle and higuain starved of service , argentina turned to the flanks .
many of their offensive moves in the latter stages of the first half were played through angel di maria , who took advantage of the space he found out on the wings .
his crosses , however , were not good enough to break the german defense - and the times his play did test german goalkeeper manuel neuer were when he shot from distance .
argentina 's second half started brightly , with the team 's build-up play becoming more energetic and direct , but germany , in its short bursts of possession , still appeared more dangerous .
so while it was against the run of play in possession terms , germany 's second , pivotal goal in the 68th minute did not come as a surprise .
in a move reminiscent of so many we have seen from germany over the past few weeks , they got forward in numbers and put the ball exactly where it needed to be when it counted .
bildunterschrift : germany 's second goal settled the contest - argentina never looked like scoring again scary good germany are so locked-in at the moment , even thomas mueller 's slipping to the ground in the midst of the attack that led to the goal was not enough to slow it down .
the ball he fed to lukas podolski was all the more sweet in that he delivered it sitting down .
from then on , argentina were broken .
their defense put in nary a challenge to schweinsteiger as he made his run toward goal on germany 's third in the 74th minute , allowing him to lay off to arne friedrich for a tap-in .
and the fourth , a coast-to coast bum-rush involving just four easy passes , showed there was just one team still on the pitch in the game 's penultimate minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona admitted his side had been well beaten argentina coach diego maradona looked shell-shocked after the game .
all the freedom he 'd given his stars to create , all the praise he 'd lavished on them had come to naught against a team with a plan , and the men to execute it .
" we studied germany well and defined exactly who was playing where but from the first cross they got a goal and suddenly it was a different match , " said maradona .
" they had more ideas and better control of the ball .
they took advantage of the opportunities they had . "

argentina 's vaunted danger men - lionel messi , carlos tevez , and gonzalo higuain - never got into gear , seeming to have no answer to germany 's dogged defending , and wary of making a mistake that could touch off a german counter .
" our defensive effort was unbelievable , " said germany coach joachim loew after the match .
" messi , and also higuain and tevez were taken out of the game , and we hardly even fouled them .

this time was different .
nicolas otamendi 's lackadaisical marking allowed thomas mueller to break the ice in a game - a costly error , as it turned out .
argentina did take more possession as the first half went on , but never did much with it , probing around the edge of the penalty area to no avail .
germany 's passing on its frequent counter-attacks , meanwhile , was crisp , purposeful , and foreshadowed the goals that would later flood in .
plan b with the likes of messi and tevez making little headway through the middle and higuain starved of service , argentina turned to the flanks .
many of their offensive moves in the latter stages of the first half were played through angel di maria , who took advantage of the space he found out on the wings .
his crosses , however , were not good enough to break the german defense - and the times his play did test german goalkeeper manuel neuer were when he shot from distance .
argentina 's second half started brightly , with the team 's build-up play becoming more energetic and direct , but germany , in its short bursts of possession , still appeared more dangerous .
so while it was against the run of play in possession terms , germany 's second , pivotal goal in the 68th minute did not come as a surprise .
in a move reminiscent of so many we have seen from germany over the past few weeks , they got forward in numbers and put the ball exactly where it needed to be when it counted .
bildunterschrift : germany 's second goal settled the contest - argentina never looked like scoring again scary good germany are so locked-in at the moment , even thomas mueller 's slipping to the ground in the midst of the attack that led to the goal was not enough to slow it down .
the ball he fed to lukas podolski was all the more sweet in that he delivered it sitting down .
from then on , argentina were broken .
their defense put in nary a challenge to schweinsteiger as he made his run toward goal on germany 's third in the 74th minute , allowing him to lay off to arne friedrich for a tap-in .
and the fourth , a coast-to coast bum-rush involving just four easy passes , showed there was just one team still on the pitch in the game 's penultimate minute .

bildunterschrift : coach joachim loew , center , had every reason to cheer as his side banged in four goals - again the germans got off to a flying start , scoring the quickest goal of the world cup this year against a shocked argentina backline , with thomas mueller heading home a free-kick in just the third minute .
the 20-year-old mueller , who was a two-goal hero against england in the previous round , has now scored four in the competition from his position on the right flank .
" it 's insane , after thrashing argentina 4-0 , i 'm almost lost for words , " mueller told reporters after the match .
" the star today , once again , was the team as a whole . "
mueller , however , will play no part in the semifinal .
the bayern munich man picked up his second yellow card of the competition from a handball call that was more than a bit questionable by the referee , meaning he will serve a one-match ban .

even after losing his footing , a seated mueller played a great through-ball for lukas podolski on the left wing , who delivered the perfect cross to miroslav klose in front of goal .
after argentine goalie sergio romero dived for the cross and missed , klose simply had to tap the ball into an open net .
moments later arne friedrich - pushing forward from the center of defense - put the finishing touches on a great cross from bastian schweinsteiger to make it 3-0 germany with just a quarter of an hour to play .

with his second-half brace , the frontman grabbed his 13th and 14th career world cup goals , meaning he is now level with legendary striker gerd mueller as the most prolific german in world cup history .
he only needs one more to tie the overall record of 15 goals , held by the brazilian goal-machine ronaldo .

and so it was , but few had predicted what a mismatch that would be . on saturday afternoon , germany delighted its fans - and struck a blow for fans of teamwork everywhere - by leveling an argentina side long on reputation and individual skill but short on ideas .
from start to finish , germany 's tactical discipline was miles ahead of argentina , and their combination play created far more goal-scoring chances .
the 4-0 finish was surprising , but richly deserved too .
argentina 's vaunted danger men - lionel messi , carlos tevez , and gonzalo higuain - never got into gear , seeming to have no answer to germany 's dogged defending , and wary of making a mistake that could touch off a german counter .
" our defensive effort was unbelievable , " said germany coach joachim loew after the match .
" messi , and also higuain and tevez were taken out of the game , and we hardly even fouled them .
we tackled at a very high level - exactly what i like to see . "
to be fair , argentina were put on the back foot early , giving up a soft goal in the third minute .
in a sense , this seemed fated .
bildunterschrift : a schweinsteiger cross , a mueller goal , a whole different ballgame the south americans ' defensive frailties had shown up in prior games in this tournament , as when martin demichelis errors gifted goals to south korea and mexico , but in those cases argentina had been cruising to victory and thus went unpunished for their sloppy play .
this time was different .
nicolas otamendi 's lackadaisical marking allowed thomas mueller to break the ice in a game - a costly error , as it turned out .
argentina did take more possession as the first half went on , but never did much with it , probing around the edge of the penalty area to no avail .
germany 's passing on its frequent counter-attacks , meanwhile , was crisp , purposeful , and foreshadowed the goals that would later flood in .
plan b with the likes of messi and tevez making little headway through the middle and higuain starved of service , argentina turned to the flanks .
many of their offensive moves in the latter stages of the first half were played through angel di maria , who took advantage of the space he found out on the wings .
his crosses , however , were not good enough to break the german defense - and the times his play did test german goalkeeper manuel neuer were when he shot from distance .
argentina 's second half started brightly , with the team 's build-up play becoming more energetic and direct , but germany , in its short bursts of possession , still appeared more dangerous .
so while it was against the run of play in possession terms , germany 's second , pivotal goal in the 68th minute did not come as a surprise .
in a move reminiscent of so many we have seen from germany over the past few weeks , they got forward in numbers and put the ball exactly where it needed to be when it counted .
bildunterschrift : germany 's second goal settled the contest - argentina never looked like scoring again scary good germany are so locked-in at the moment , even thomas mueller 's slipping to the ground in the midst of the attack that led to the goal was not enough to slow it down .
the ball he fed to lukas podolski was all the more sweet in that he delivered it sitting down .
from then on , argentina were broken .
their defense put in nary a challenge to schweinsteiger as he made his run toward goal on germany 's third in the 74th minute , allowing him to lay off to arne friedrich for a tap-in .
and the fourth , a coast-to coast bum-rush involving just four easy passes , showed there was just one team still on the pitch in the game 's penultimate minute .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona admitted his side had been well beaten argentina coach diego maradona looked shell-shocked after the game .
all the freedom he 'd given his stars to create , all the praise he 'd lavished on them had come to naught against a team with a plan , and the men to execute it .
" we studied germany well and defined exactly who was playing where but from the first cross they got a goal and suddenly it was a different match , " said maradona .
" they had more ideas and better control of the ball .
they took advantage of the opportunities they had . "
enough said .

" we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .
" these children then go to hamas 's koran schools , " she said , adding that the blockade could thus only fuel radical islamism . an end to isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will not apologize for raiding aid ships social democrat mp rolf muetzenich supports mueller 's criticism of the blockade .
muetzenich has called for not only humanitarian aid to gaza , but support to help the region rebuild itself economically and end its political isolation . " we must promote the message among the palestinian fractions that only a government of national unity will allow for an ongoing and just peace solution in palestine - and then be of benefit to israel , " he said . all bundestag fractions agreed that an end to the blockade would indeed benefit israel .
" yet we must not lose sight of israel 's security needs , " said christian democrat philipp missfelder - to the applause of the house . author : bettina marx / dl -lrb- dpa -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spain will face germany in the semis , after jogi loew 's men thrashed argentina . the match between spain and paraguay was a comparatively stale one , after germany 's up-tempo drubbing of argentina earlier on saturday .
david villa scored for the spaniards late on , but it was a tough route towards the semifinal for his side .
paraguay sat deep , looking to stifle the european champions spain , who played their characteristically composed , but somehow impotent passing game .
spain were confident in possession , sometimes stringing dozens of uninterrupted passes together , but they crafted few real goal scoring opportunities .
for all spain 's possession , paraguay had the ball in the net shortly before half time , with borussia dortmund 's nelson valdez latching on to a long free-kick . the goal was disallowed , perhaps wrongly , in a borderline offside decision .
bildunterschrift : neither side really pulled in the right direction livelier second half in the second half both sides squandered chances from the penalty spot in the space of a few minutes .
paraguay 's oscar cardozo was pulled down in the box , got back up to take the spot-kick himself , but iker casillas made a fairly comfortable save .
in the very next attack david villa won a penalty for spain .
xavi alonso stepped up and scored , but the shot had to be retaken after spanish players rushed into the area before alonso struck .
at the second attempt alonso 's shot was saved in almost the exact same manner as cardozo 's had been moments earlier .
these misses at least provided a necessary spark to the match , and on 82 minutes david villa finally scored the decisive goal for spain , but even then the ball seemed unwilling to cross the goal line .
andres iniesta put pedro clean through , but the substitute 's shot rebounded off the post .
villa was in the right place at the right time , and side-footed the rebound towards goal .

david villa scored for the spaniards late on , but it was a tough route towards the semifinal for his side .
paraguay sat deep , looking to stifle the european champions spain , who played their characteristically composed , but somehow impotent passing game .
spain were confident in possession , sometimes stringing dozens of uninterrupted passes together , but they crafted few real goal scoring opportunities .
for all spain 's possession , paraguay had the ball in the net shortly before half time , with borussia dortmund 's nelson valdez latching on to a long free-kick . the goal was disallowed , perhaps wrongly , in a borderline offside decision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de democracy -pipe- 03.07.2010 kyrgyzstan 's interim leader sworn in as president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otunbayeva is looking to usher in a new era in kyrgyzstan kyrgyzstan 's provisional leader roza otunbayeva has been sworn in as president , ushering in what the central asian nation 's government hopes will be a new era of stability and democratic freedoms . roza otunbayeva was sworn in as kyrgyzstan 's president on saturday , making her the first female leader in the history of the ex-soviet central asian nation .
in front of more than 1,000 cheering onlookers at a packed concert hall in the capital bishkek , otunbayeva somberly took her oath and promised a new political era for crisis-ridden kyrgyzstan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic violence has died down since erupting in april " as president , i will spare no effort to create a new political culture for the country based on a strict adherence to the rule of law , " she told the assembled crowd .
" i must be principled and consistently make demands on all branches of government to ensure it .
the new policy can not be built on fantasies and illusions .
it must be real and effective . "
inauguration comes at delicate moment otunbayeva takes over the government as kyrgyzstan has been wracked by violence and political instability .
thousands have died in ethnic violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks since then-president kurmanbek bakiyev was removed from power in a bloody coup in april .
at least 75,000 people fled to neighboring uzbekistan , leading international aid agencies to warn of an impending humanitarian crisis in dealing with the thousands of families left homeless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of thousands remain homeless in the south the inauguration comes just days after the country overwhelmingly approved a new constitution that will make kyrgyzstan the region 's first parliamentary democracy , a move the government hopes will bring a measure of stability .
the new constitution slashes the powers of the president and sets the stage for parliamentary elections that authorities have scheduled for early october to bring in a permanent government .
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , has questioned the feasibility of kyrgyzstan 's aspirations for a parliamentary democracy , warning that it could lead to further instability in the country and the region .
he said last week on the sidelines of the g20 summit in toronto that a lack of autocratic rule in kyrgyzstan could result in a " relapse into factionalism , " giving rise to a " breeding ground for islamist extremism . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 03.07.2010 germany calls for an end to israel 's gaza blockade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mps say ending the blockade would benefit israel the german parliament has united in denouncing israel 's handling of gaza , calling for an end to the blockade . germany 's government called friday for an immediate end to the blockade of the gaza strip after a unanimous vote in the country 's bundestag parliament condemning israel 's handling of the territory . " we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .
" these children then go to hamas 's koran schools , " she said , adding that the blockade could thus only fuel radical islamism . an end to isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will not apologize for raiding aid ships social democrat mp rolf muetzenich supports mueller 's criticism of the blockade .
muetzenich has called for not only humanitarian aid to gaza , but support to help the region rebuild itself economically and end its political isolation . " we must promote the message among the palestinian fractions that only a government of national unity will allow for an ongoing and just peace solution in palestine - and then be of benefit to israel , " he said . all bundestag fractions agreed that an end to the blockade would indeed benefit israel .
" yet we must not lose sight of israel 's security needs , " said christian democrat philipp missfelder - to the applause of the house . author : bettina marx / dl -lrb- dpa -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .
" these children then go to hamas 's koran schools , " she said , adding that the blockade could thus only fuel radical islamism . an end to isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will not apologize for raiding aid ships social democrat mp rolf muetzenich supports mueller 's criticism of the blockade .
muetzenich has called for not only humanitarian aid to gaza , but support to help the region rebuild itself economically and end its political isolation . " we must promote the message among the palestinian fractions that only a government of national unity will allow for an ongoing and just peace solution in palestine - and then be of benefit to israel , " he said . all bundestag fractions agreed that an end to the blockade would indeed benefit israel .
" yet we must not lose sight of israel 's security needs , " said christian democrat philipp missfelder - to the applause of the house . author : bettina marx / dl -lrb- dpa -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

miroslav klose scored twice , along with goals from thomas mueller and defender arne friedrich . germany have scored four goals for the third time in the world cup , this time dispatching argentina with shocking ease in the quarterfinal .
" now we 're among the best four teams in the world , and that 's exactly where this team belongs , " coach joachim loew said after the game .
" our destiny is in our own hands now , we can achieve something really great here . "
bildunterschrift : coach joachim loew , center , had every reason to cheer as his side banged in four goals - again the germans got off to a flying start , scoring the quickest goal of the world cup this year against a shocked argentina backline , with thomas mueller heading home a free-kick in just the third minute .
the 20-year-old mueller , who was a two-goal hero against england in the previous round , has now scored four in the competition from his position on the right flank .
" it 's insane , after thrashing argentina 4-0 , i 'm almost lost for words , " mueller told reporters after the match .
" the star today , once again , was the team as a whole . "
mueller , however , will play no part in the semifinal .
the bayern munich man picked up his second yellow card of the competition from a handball call that was more than a bit questionable by the referee , meaning he will serve a one-match ban .

with his second-half brace , the frontman grabbed his 13th and 14th career world cup goals , meaning he is now level with legendary striker gerd mueller as the most prolific german in world cup history .
he only needs one more to tie the overall record of 15 goals , held by the brazilian goal-machine ronaldo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 03.07.2010 online giant amazon enters the grocery business in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon started selling books , but has gone far beyond that amazon has begun selling food , including fresh products , to consumers in germany .
the us company hopes to succeed in a market where numerous german food retailers and internet startups so far have struggled - or failed . consumers in germany can now turn to amazon to purchase not only books , movies and other popular merchandise but also groceries , including fresh fruit , vegetables and meat .
the new online offering covers more than 35,000 products .
most of them are supplied by a network of more than 60 suppliers , including froodies , gourmantis and moevenpick .
same-day delivery delivery for edibles is the same as amazon 's normal service in germany , which is free for purchases above 20 euros .
and , initially in berlin and frankfurt , the company guarantees same-day delivery for orders made before 11 am .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is hoping that convenience will spur people to buy food online amazon has been selling a range of food products in the united states since 2006 , adding perishables like grapes and steaks a couple years ago .
but online food sales have been anything but easy .
prior to the launch of its own online grocery offer , the company made numerous investments in web-to-doorstep grocery delivery ventures in the us during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s .
homegrocer.com , kozo.com and webvan were among them .
all failed , largely due to the need to build up a massive logistical infrastructure .
short distances to stores since then , amazon claims it has learned to work with regional partners to overcome challenges such as sourcing local products and providing an uncomplicated delivery infrastructure .
this regional partnership model is what the company hopes to transplant successfully in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edeka is one of several big german supermarkets to test the waters for online food sales like the us , germany has seen its fair share of online grocers come and go .
" all of the big food retailers in germany , like edeka , real and rewe , have launched online delivery services , then discontinued them only to try again , but so far without huge success , " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert told deutsche welle .
" germany is a country of short distances to stores .
people are simply used to going to stores to buy their groceries . "
online food sales in germany , according to wolfgang adelwarth at market-research company gfk , account for less than 1 percent of the country 's 150-billion-plus grocery market .
trend toward convenience " i see a very limited market for online food sales , " adelwarth told deutsche welle .
" there is a market for speciality products , like wine , and there is a group of young professionals who are too busy too shop in stores , but beyond that i do n't see huge demand in germany . "
still , eggert points to a trend toward convenience among german consumers , both young and old , that could spur online food sales .
but a successful online grocery delivery service in the country , he warns , will not come quickly or cheaply .
" it will take time and money , which amazon has , " eggert said .
" the company clearly sees an opportunity . "

" we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .
" these children then go to hamas 's koran schools , " she said , adding that the blockade could thus only fuel radical islamism . an end to isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will not apologize for raiding aid ships social democrat mp rolf muetzenich supports mueller 's criticism of the blockade .
muetzenich has called for not only humanitarian aid to gaza , but support to help the region rebuild itself economically and end its political isolation . " we must promote the message among the palestinian fractions that only a government of national unity will allow for an ongoing and just peace solution in palestine - and then be of benefit to israel , " he said . all bundestag fractions agreed that an end to the blockade would indeed benefit israel .
" yet we must not lose sight of israel 's security needs , " said christian democrat philipp missfelder - to the applause of the house . author : bettina marx / dl -lrb- dpa -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 4-0 finish was surprising , but richly deserved too .
argentina 's vaunted danger men - lionel messi , carlos tevez , and gonzalo higuain - never got into gear , seeming to have no answer to germany 's dogged defending , and wary of making a mistake that could touch off a german counter .
" our defensive effort was unbelievable , " said germany coach joachim loew after the match .

argentina 's second half started brightly , with the team 's build-up play becoming more energetic and direct , but germany , in its short bursts of possession , still appeared more dangerous .
so while it was against the run of play in possession terms , germany 's second , pivotal goal in the 68th minute did not come as a surprise .

spain will face germany in the semis , after jogi loew 's men thrashed argentina . the match between spain and paraguay was a comparatively stale one , after germany 's up-tempo drubbing of argentina earlier on saturday .
david villa scored for the spaniards late on , but it was a tough route towards the semifinal for his side .
paraguay sat deep , looking to stifle the european champions spain , who played their characteristically composed , but somehow impotent passing game .
spain were confident in possession , sometimes stringing dozens of uninterrupted passes together , but they crafted few real goal scoring opportunities .
for all spain 's possession , paraguay had the ball in the net shortly before half time , with borussia dortmund 's nelson valdez latching on to a long free-kick . the goal was disallowed , perhaps wrongly , in a borderline offside decision .
bildunterschrift : neither side really pulled in the right direction livelier second half in the second half both sides squandered chances from the penalty spot in the space of a few minutes .
paraguay 's oscar cardozo was pulled down in the box , got back up to take the spot-kick himself , but iker casillas made a fairly comfortable save .
in the very next attack david villa won a penalty for spain .
xavi alonso stepped up and scored , but the shot had to be retaken after spanish players rushed into the area before alonso struck .
at the second attempt alonso 's shot was saved in almost the exact same manner as cardozo 's had been moments earlier .
these misses at least provided a necessary spark to the match , and on 82 minutes david villa finally scored the decisive goal for spain , but even then the ball seemed unwilling to cross the goal line .
andres iniesta put pedro clean through , but the substitute 's shot rebounded off the post .
villa was in the right place at the right time , and side-footed the rebound towards goal .
his shot eventually went in , but only after hitting the inside of both posts .
the final few minutes were a frenetic affair , with chances at both ends and spanish defender sergio ramos taking a nasty kick to the face , but in the end the score remained 1-0 spain .
germany watched with interest as victors , spain will go on to face joachim loew 's german side in the semifinals on wednesday .
german midfielder bastian schweinsteiger magnanimously said he believed spain to be the best team in the world , just after his side had staked a claim to that honor with their 4-0 demolition of many people 's tournament favorites argentina .
he did say , however , that germany had what it takes to beat them .
now he will have his chance to find out whether he 's right .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 03.07.2010 germany calls for an end to israel 's gaza blockade großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mps say ending the blockade would benefit israel the german parliament has united in denouncing israel 's handling of gaza , calling for an end to the blockade . germany 's government called friday for an immediate end to the blockade of the gaza strip after a unanimous vote in the country 's bundestag parliament condemning israel 's handling of the territory . " we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .
" these children then go to hamas 's koran schools , " she said , adding that the blockade could thus only fuel radical islamism . an end to isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will not apologize for raiding aid ships social democrat mp rolf muetzenich supports mueller 's criticism of the blockade .
muetzenich has called for not only humanitarian aid to gaza , but support to help the region rebuild itself economically and end its political isolation . " we must promote the message among the palestinian fractions that only a government of national unity will allow for an ongoing and just peace solution in palestine - and then be of benefit to israel , " he said . all bundestag fractions agreed that an end to the blockade would indeed benefit israel .
" yet we must not lose sight of israel 's security needs , " said christian democrat philipp missfelder - to the applause of the house . author : bettina marx / dl -lrb- dpa -rrb- editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .
" these children then go to hamas 's koran schools , " she said , adding that the blockade could thus only fuel radical islamism . an end to isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will not apologize for raiding aid ships social democrat mp rolf muetzenich supports mueller 's criticism of the blockade .
muetzenich has called for not only humanitarian aid to gaza , but support to help the region rebuild itself economically and end its political isolation . " we must promote the message among the palestinian fractions that only a government of national unity will allow for an ongoing and just peace solution in palestine - and then be of benefit to israel , " he said . all bundestag fractions agreed that an end to the blockade would indeed benefit israel .

" even before the game , they 're at it .
the way they gesture , their attempts to influence the referee .
it shows a lack of respect , but that 's just the way the argentines are . "
bastian schweinsteiger , making clear what he thinks of argentina this week .
he also shared his most vivid memory of the game between the two sides at the same quarterfinal stage of the 2006 tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger did n't mince words about argentina " what i remember most is what happened after the game , the brawl which was triggered by the argentinians , " said the germany midfielder .
referring to that fight , captain philipp lahm said he thought its genesis was simple : the argentines " do n't know how to lose . "
the post-match melee meant a suspension for schweinsteiger 's predecessor in germany 's holding midfield role , torsten frings .
the german team went on to lose their next match to italy , and many in germany still feel frings ' absence was decisive in the semi-final defeat .
schweinsteiger said nothing of the kind would happen this time .
" we will not be intimidated or respond to their provocations .
i hope the referee will be watching the game closely , " he said .
returning fire … or holding it ?
having been provoked , the argentina camp wasted little time in firing back - through the ever-passionate carlos tevez .
" i was more afraid of mexico than germany , " tevez told the argentine newspaper clarin .
" the mexicans play better football . "
ouch .
bildunterschrift : just as he was in 2006 , tevez will be a handful for german defenders like arne friedrich other than tevez 's snap , however , the south americans tried to stay low-key .
martin demichelis , who plays in germany for bayern munich , said their recent record against germany does all the talking .
" all the criticisms they make are a sign of respect and nerves .
since we beat them in march , they respect us , " he said .
argentina defeated germany in that recent friendly in munich 1-0 - a score line that flattered the comprehensively beaten hosts .
upon hearing schweinsteiger 's comments , coach diego maradona was even more dismissive .
he said his team " did n't have time to think about schweinsteiger " and ended a television interview by teasing the player .
" what 's the matter with you , schweinsteiger ?
are you getting nervous ? " said the football legend , in a mock-german accent .
switching focus just over 24 hours before the match , however , germany coach joachim loew tried to change the tone of the conversation .
firstly with kindness , as he spoke of his memories of maradona the player he galvanized the whole football world with the way he played .
he was simply magic , " said loew , who never played a starring role on the pitch himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona-fan loew is known for his nose for good football " 1986 and 1990 were the culmination of maradona 's career and he left a mark on football like no other player has ever done before or since . "
he then shared his own thoughts on the post-match fight in 2006 - which he had witnessed as an assistant coach .
" if you ask me , i think that game was at no time brutal or unfair until after the penalties .
it was tightly contested but not marred by unfairness .
the problem in 2006 started after the game had been decided , " said loew .
still , loew said his team would not come out feeling overburdened by the history between the two teams , which includes not just the 2006 brawl but two consecutive world cup finals in 1986 and 1990 , with each side getting the better of the other once .
" we will not be shivering in the changing rooms , hoping the referee wo n't start the game , " said loew .
" in matches like these , " he added , " i do n't really have to help the players with any motivational tricks . "

" even before the game , they 're at it .
the way they gesture , their attempts to influence the referee .
it shows a lack of respect , but that 's just the way the argentines are . "
bastian schweinsteiger , making clear what he thinks of argentina this week .
he also shared his most vivid memory of the game between the two sides at the same quarterfinal stage of the 2006 tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger did n't mince words about argentina " what i remember most is what happened after the game , the brawl which was triggered by the argentinians , " said the germany midfielder .
referring to that fight , captain philipp lahm said he thought its genesis was simple : the argentines " do n't know how to lose . "
the post-match melee meant a suspension for schweinsteiger 's predecessor in germany 's holding midfield role , torsten frings .
the german team went on to lose their next match to italy , and many in germany still feel frings ' absence was decisive in the semi-final defeat .
schweinsteiger said nothing of the kind would happen this time .
" we will not be intimidated or respond to their provocations .
i hope the referee will be watching the game closely , " he said .
returning fire … or holding it ?
having been provoked , the argentina camp wasted little time in firing back - through the ever-passionate carlos tevez .

" we have repeatedly made it clear that israel has to enable access to the gaza strip on humanitarian grounds and for the sake of reconstruction , " said ulrich wilhelm , the german government 's spokesman . the bundestag on friday declared israel 's blockade of the gaza strip counterproductive and a violation of international law .
the high level of multipartisan agreement seen in the bundestag is rare , and the decision is expected to strengthen chancellor angela merkel 's government in its policy regarding the blockade . while the german government 's call met with some annoyance in israel , in berlin free democrat member of parliament rainer stinner welcomed the bundestag 's unity .
" what we are experiencing here is , in fact , a new quality of joint foreign and security policy , " he stated . " this means that , for the first time in our discussions of the middle east , all the house 's factions share the same petition , " left party mp wolfgang gehrcke said , adding , " the middle east will surely take note of this signal as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundestag fractions were in a rare state of agreement on the blockade a question of motivation gehrcke stressed that the decision was neither anti-israel nor anti-palestine , but that his concerns were with both the israeli and palestinian peoples .
stinner agreed with that statement , adding that the bundestag 's denouncement of the blockade was in no way a departure from the bundestag 's consensus on its historically-based special relationship with israel . the only damper on friday 's unity within the parliament came from thomas silberhorn of bavaria 's christian social union party .
silberhorn levied accusations that the left party supporting islamist forces by supporting the participation of two members of parliament in the gaza aid flotilla intercepted by israeli defence forces at the end of may . " they were less concerned for the people in gaza than about confrontation with israel , " he alleged . an " inhumane blockade " other than silberhorn 's statements , the gaza flotilla and israel 's deadly mission against the ships played no further role in the debate .
in fact , there was not much of a debate at all ; for once , an air of agreement in condemning the blockade dominated .
the bundestag referred to the blockade as " inhumane " and " counterproductive , " according to green party mp kerstin mueller , who said that the blockade only benefits the islamist terrorist organization hamas . " it 's absurd that this blockade becomes a de facto un blockade , " mueller said , explaining that , in accordance with the blockade , the un refused to buy building materials for new schools .
with present schools overfilled , mueller said , that leaves 40,000 children with no school to attend .
" these children then go to hamas 's koran schools , " she said , adding that the blockade could thus only fuel radical islamism . an end to isolation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel will not apologize for raiding aid ships social democrat mp rolf muetzenich supports mueller 's criticism of the blockade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 03.07.2010 online giant amazon enters the grocery business in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon started selling books , but has gone far beyond that amazon has begun selling food , including fresh products , to consumers in germany .
the us company hopes to succeed in a market where numerous german food retailers and internet startups so far have struggled - or failed . consumers in germany can now turn to amazon to purchase not only books , movies and other popular merchandise but also groceries , including fresh fruit , vegetables and meat .
the new online offering covers more than 35,000 products .
most of them are supplied by a network of more than 60 suppliers , including froodies , gourmantis and moevenpick .
same-day delivery delivery for edibles is the same as amazon 's normal service in germany , which is free for purchases above 20 euros .
and , initially in berlin and frankfurt , the company guarantees same-day delivery for orders made before 11 am .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is hoping that convenience will spur people to buy food online amazon has been selling a range of food products in the united states since 2006 , adding perishables like grapes and steaks a couple years ago .
but online food sales have been anything but easy .
prior to the launch of its own online grocery offer , the company made numerous investments in web-to-doorstep grocery delivery ventures in the us during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s .
homegrocer.com , kozo.com and webvan were among them .
all failed , largely due to the need to build up a massive logistical infrastructure .
short distances to stores since then , amazon claims it has learned to work with regional partners to overcome challenges such as sourcing local products and providing an uncomplicated delivery infrastructure .
this regional partnership model is what the company hopes to transplant successfully in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edeka is one of several big german supermarkets to test the waters for online food sales like the us , germany has seen its fair share of online grocers come and go .
" all of the big food retailers in germany , like edeka , real and rewe , have launched online delivery services , then discontinued them only to try again , but so far without huge success , " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert told deutsche welle .
" germany is a country of short distances to stores .
people are simply used to going to stores to buy their groceries . "
online food sales in germany , according to wolfgang adelwarth at market-research company gfk , account for less than 1 percent of the country 's 150-billion-plus grocery market .
trend toward convenience " i see a very limited market for online food sales , " adelwarth told deutsche welle .
" there is a market for speciality products , like wine , and there is a group of young professionals who are too busy too shop in stores , but beyond that i do n't see huge demand in germany . "
still , eggert points to a trend toward convenience among german consumers , both young and old , that could spur online food sales .
but a successful online grocery delivery service in the country , he warns , will not come quickly or cheaply .
" it will take time and money , which amazon has , " eggert said .
" the company clearly sees an opportunity . "

the us company hopes to succeed in a market where numerous german food retailers and internet startups so far have struggled - or failed . consumers in germany can now turn to amazon to purchase not only books , movies and other popular merchandise but also groceries , including fresh fruit , vegetables and meat .
the new online offering covers more than 35,000 products .
most of them are supplied by a network of more than 60 suppliers , including froodies , gourmantis and moevenpick .
same-day delivery delivery for edibles is the same as amazon 's normal service in germany , which is free for purchases above 20 euros .
and , initially in berlin and frankfurt , the company guarantees same-day delivery for orders made before 11 am .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon is hoping that convenience will spur people to buy food online amazon has been selling a range of food products in the united states since 2006 , adding perishables like grapes and steaks a couple years ago .
but online food sales have been anything but easy .
prior to the launch of its own online grocery offer , the company made numerous investments in web-to-doorstep grocery delivery ventures in the us during the dotcom boom of the late 1990s .
homegrocer.com , kozo.com and webvan were among them .
all failed , largely due to the need to build up a massive logistical infrastructure .
short distances to stores since then , amazon claims it has learned to work with regional partners to overcome challenges such as sourcing local products and providing an uncomplicated delivery infrastructure .
this regional partnership model is what the company hopes to transplant successfully in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edeka is one of several big german supermarkets to test the waters for online food sales like the us , germany has seen its fair share of online grocers come and go .
" all of the big food retailers in germany , like edeka , real and rewe , have launched online delivery services , then discontinued them only to try again , but so far without huge success , " independent retail consultant ulrich eggert told deutsche welle .
" germany is a country of short distances to stores .
people are simply used to going to stores to buy their groceries . "
online food sales in germany , according to wolfgang adelwarth at market-research company gfk , account for less than 1 percent of the country 's 150-billion-plus grocery market .
trend toward convenience " i see a very limited market for online food sales , " adelwarth told deutsche welle .
" there is a market for speciality products , like wine , and there is a group of young professionals who are too busy too shop in stores , but beyond that i do n't see huge demand in germany . "
still , eggert points to a trend toward convenience among german consumers , both young and old , that could spur online food sales .
but a successful online grocery delivery service in the country , he warns , will not come quickly or cheaply .
" it will take time and money , which amazon has , " eggert said .
" the company clearly sees an opportunity . "

miroslav klose scored twice , along with goals from thomas mueller and defender arne friedrich . germany have scored four goals for the third time in the world cup , this time dispatching argentina with shocking ease in the quarterfinal .
" now we 're among the best four teams in the world , and that 's exactly where this team belongs , " coach joachim loew said after the game .
" our destiny is in our own hands now , we can achieve something really great here . "
bildunterschrift : coach joachim loew , center , had every reason to cheer as his side banged in four goals - again the germans got off to a flying start , scoring the quickest goal of the world cup this year against a shocked argentina backline , with thomas mueller heading home a free-kick in just the third minute .
the 20-year-old mueller , who was a two-goal hero against england in the previous round , has now scored four in the competition from his position on the right flank .
" it 's insane , after thrashing argentina 4-0 , i 'm almost lost for words , " mueller told reporters after the match .
" the star today , once again , was the team as a whole . "
mueller , however , will play no part in the semifinal .
the bayern munich man picked up his second yellow card of the competition from a handball call that was more than a bit questionable by the referee , meaning he will serve a one-match ban .
" i hope that my teammates get everything right in the semifnal , then i can come back and score another goal in the final , " the upbeat youngster concluded .
scorer turns provider despite this setback , mueller remained a key man going forward for joachim loew 's men , and displayed fantastic determination and awareness in the build up for germany 's second goal .
even after losing his footing , a seated mueller played a great through-ball for lukas podolski on the left wing , who delivered the perfect cross to miroslav klose in front of goal .
after argentine goalie sergio romero dived for the cross and missed , klose simply had to tap the ball into an open net .
moments later arne friedrich - pushing forward from the center of defense - put the finishing touches on a great cross from bastian schweinsteiger to make it 3-0 germany with just a quarter of an hour to play .
closing in on the record bildunterschrift : miroslav klose , left , only needs two more goals to become the world cup 's deadliest ever striker in the dying minutes , with argentina clearly broken , germany made it four , again through miroslav klose .
the veteran 's 100th game for his country could hardly have been scripted better .
with his second-half brace , the frontman grabbed his 13th and 14th career world cup goals , meaning he is now level with legendary striker gerd mueller as the most prolific german in world cup history .
he only needs one more to tie the overall record of 15 goals , held by the brazilian goal-machine ronaldo .

" even before the game , they 're at it .
the way they gesture , their attempts to influence the referee .
it shows a lack of respect , but that 's just the way the argentines are . "
bastian schweinsteiger , making clear what he thinks of argentina this week .
he also shared his most vivid memory of the game between the two sides at the same quarterfinal stage of the 2006 tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger did n't mince words about argentina " what i remember most is what happened after the game , the brawl which was triggered by the argentinians , " said the germany midfielder .
referring to that fight , captain philipp lahm said he thought its genesis was simple : the argentines " do n't know how to lose . "
the post-match melee meant a suspension for schweinsteiger 's predecessor in germany 's holding midfield role , torsten frings .
the german team went on to lose their next match to italy , and many in germany still feel frings ' absence was decisive in the semi-final defeat .
schweinsteiger said nothing of the kind would happen this time .
" we will not be intimidated or respond to their provocations .
i hope the referee will be watching the game closely , " he said .
returning fire … or holding it ?
having been provoked , the argentina camp wasted little time in firing back - through the ever-passionate carlos tevez .
" i was more afraid of mexico than germany , " tevez told the argentine newspaper clarin .
" the mexicans play better football . "
ouch .
bildunterschrift : just as he was in 2006 , tevez will be a handful for german defenders like arne friedrich other than tevez 's snap , however , the south americans tried to stay low-key .
martin demichelis , who plays in germany for bayern munich , said their recent record against germany does all the talking .
" all the criticisms they make are a sign of respect and nerves .
since we beat them in march , they respect us , " he said .
argentina defeated germany in that recent friendly in munich 1-0 - a score line that flattered the comprehensively beaten hosts .
upon hearing schweinsteiger 's comments , coach diego maradona was even more dismissive .
he said his team " did n't have time to think about schweinsteiger " and ended a television interview by teasing the player .
" what 's the matter with you , schweinsteiger ?
are you getting nervous ? " said the football legend , in a mock-german accent .
switching focus just over 24 hours before the match , however , germany coach joachim loew tried to change the tone of the conversation .
firstly with kindness , as he spoke of his memories of maradona the player he galvanized the whole football world with the way he played .
he was simply magic , " said loew , who never played a starring role on the pitch himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona-fan loew is known for his nose for good football " 1986 and 1990 were the culmination of maradona 's career and he left a mark on football like no other player has ever done before or since . "
he then shared his own thoughts on the post-match fight in 2006 - which he had witnessed as an assistant coach .
" if you ask me , i think that game was at no time brutal or unfair until after the penalties .
it was tightly contested but not marred by unfairness .
the problem in 2006 started after the game had been decided , " said loew .
still , loew said his team would not come out feeling overburdened by the history between the two teams , which includes not just the 2006 brawl but two consecutive world cup finals in 1986 and 1990 , with each side getting the better of the other once .
" we will not be shivering in the changing rooms , hoping the referee wo n't start the game , " said loew .
" in matches like these , " he added , " i do n't really have to help the players with any motivational tricks . "

" even before the game , they 're at it .
the way they gesture , their attempts to influence the referee .
it shows a lack of respect , but that 's just the way the argentines are . "
bastian schweinsteiger , making clear what he thinks of argentina this week .
he also shared his most vivid memory of the game between the two sides at the same quarterfinal stage of the 2006 tournament .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schweinsteiger did n't mince words about argentina " what i remember most is what happened after the game , the brawl which was triggered by the argentinians , " said the germany midfielder .
referring to that fight , captain philipp lahm said he thought its genesis was simple : the argentines " do n't know how to lose . "
the post-match melee meant a suspension for schweinsteiger 's predecessor in germany 's holding midfield role , torsten frings .
the german team went on to lose their next match to italy , and many in germany still feel frings ' absence was decisive in the semi-final defeat .
schweinsteiger said nothing of the kind would happen this time .
" we will not be intimidated or respond to their provocations .
i hope the referee will be watching the game closely , " he said .
returning fire … or holding it ?
having been provoked , the argentina camp wasted little time in firing back - through the ever-passionate carlos tevez .
" i was more afraid of mexico than germany , " tevez told the argentine newspaper clarin .
" the mexicans play better football . "
ouch .
bildunterschrift : just as he was in 2006 , tevez will be a handful for german defenders like arne friedrich other than tevez 's snap , however , the south americans tried to stay low-key .
martin demichelis , who plays in germany for bayern munich , said their recent record against germany does all the talking .
" all the criticisms they make are a sign of respect and nerves .
since we beat them in march , they respect us , " he said .
argentina defeated germany in that recent friendly in munich 1-0 - a score line that flattered the comprehensively beaten hosts .
upon hearing schweinsteiger 's comments , coach diego maradona was even more dismissive .
he said his team " did n't have time to think about schweinsteiger " and ended a television interview by teasing the player .
" what 's the matter with you , schweinsteiger ?
are you getting nervous ? " said the football legend , in a mock-german accent .
switching focus just over 24 hours before the match , however , germany coach joachim loew tried to change the tone of the conversation .
firstly with kindness , as he spoke of his memories of maradona the player he galvanized the whole football world with the way he played .
he was simply magic , " said loew , who never played a starring role on the pitch himself .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maradona-fan loew is known for his nose for good football " 1986 and 1990 were the culmination of maradona 's career and he left a mark on football like no other player has ever done before or since . "
he then shared his own thoughts on the post-match fight in 2006 - which he had witnessed as an assistant coach .
" if you ask me , i think that game was at no time brutal or unfair until after the penalties .
it was tightly contested but not marred by unfairness .
the problem in 2006 started after the game had been decided , " said loew .
still , loew said his team would not come out feeling overburdened by the history between the two teams , which includes not just the 2006 brawl but two consecutive world cup finals in 1986 and 1990 , with each side getting the better of the other once .
" we will not be shivering in the changing rooms , hoping the referee wo n't start the game , " said loew .
" in matches like these , " he added , " i do n't really have to help the players with any motivational tricks . "

david villa scored for the spaniards late on , but it was a tough route towards the semifinal for his side .
paraguay sat deep , looking to stifle the european champions spain , who played their characteristically composed , but somehow impotent passing game .
spain were confident in possession , sometimes stringing dozens of uninterrupted passes together , but they crafted few real goal scoring opportunities .
for all spain 's possession , paraguay had the ball in the net shortly before half time , with borussia dortmund 's nelson valdez latching on to a long free-kick . the goal was disallowed , perhaps wrongly , in a borderline offside decision .

villa was in the right place at the right time , and side-footed the rebound towards goal .
his shot eventually went in , but only after hitting the inside of both posts .
the final few minutes were a frenetic affair , with chances at both ends and spanish defender sergio ramos taking a nasty kick to the face , but in the end the score remained 1-0 spain .
germany watched with interest as victors , spain will go on to face joachim loew 's german side in the semifinals on wednesday .
german midfielder bastian schweinsteiger magnanimously said he believed spain to be the best team in the world , just after his side had staked a claim to that honor with their 4-0 demolition of many people 's tournament favorites argentina .
he did say , however , that germany had what it takes to beat them .

in a film circulated on the video-sharing website youtube , former tour de france cyclist davide cassani reveals this new form of cheating - riding bikes that are , in fact , motorbikes in disguise .
" these machines have been around since 2004 and they have been used in races by professional cyclists , " cassani told france 's rtl radio .
" there are a lot of benefits using such a bike .
you can reach 50 kilometers an hour .
it has its motor in the frame and a battery between the pedals , " he explains .
suspicious bike swap the italian tv corporation rai has alleged that cancellara swapped bikes suspiciously during the recent paris-roubaix race before going on to victory .
the rider , however , insists the suggestion he used mechanical doping is ridiculous .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's fabian cancellara has been linked with mechanical doping but the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- is erring on the side of caution - on june 18 it announced it would tighten its bike checking procedures by introducing a new type of scanner .
" from now on , race service will be subject to stricter regulation in order to ensure that only equipment that has been checked at the start or finish can be used during competitions , " the uci said in a statement .
doping scandals meanwhile , drugs doping is once again casting a shadow over the tour .
italian rider riccardo ricco tested positive three days before the off and doping revelations from former rider floyd landis have implicated seven-time winner lance armstrong , who is taking part in what he says will be his last tour this year .
ricco was handed a two-month suspended jail sentence and a 3,000 euro fine for doping during the 2008 tour de france by a french court on tuesday .
the tour 's organizers insist , however , that it is now harder than ever to cheat .
" considerable progress has been made these past two years , " says christian prudhomme , director of the tour de france .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's ricco was handed a suspended sentence for doping during the 2008 tour " now cyclists have to report where they are morning , noon and night every day of the tour .
they also have to carry a biological passport which is designed to root out not only cheats who test positively in traditional tests but those who do n't but whose blood changes its composition suspiciously over time , " he explains .
riders are also subjected to surprise tests before and during the tour .
criticism from the anti-doping agency the french anti-doping agency -lrb- afld -rrb- , which this year will not be taking part in the drug control process , says that relying on biological passports alone is dangerous .
the afld says additional information from customs authorities and police investigations is needed in the fight against doping .
it also accused the icu of giving preferential treatment to riders such as lance armstrong and last year 's winner alberto contador when it came to surprise testing .
the icu and the afld have a long history of clashes .
in 2009 , they worked together during the tour de france , but the partnership was a failure , according to afld president pierre bordry , who said it would have been impossible to renew the partnership this year .

in front of more than 1,000 cheering onlookers at a packed concert hall in the capital bishkek , otunbayeva somberly took her oath and promised a new political era for crisis-ridden kyrgyzstan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic violence has died down since erupting in april " as president , i will spare no effort to create a new political culture for the country based on a strict adherence to the rule of law , " she told the assembled crowd .
" i must be principled and consistently make demands on all branches of government to ensure it .
the new policy can not be built on fantasies and illusions .
it must be real and effective . "
inauguration comes at delicate moment otunbayeva takes over the government as kyrgyzstan has been wracked by violence and political instability .
thousands have died in ethnic violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks since then-president kurmanbek bakiyev was removed from power in a bloody coup in april .
at least 75,000 people fled to neighboring uzbekistan , leading international aid agencies to warn of an impending humanitarian crisis in dealing with the thousands of families left homeless .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 03.07.2010 ailing euro needs a cure großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could the euro become history ?
the gigantic eurozone rescue plan has succeeded , at least for now , in stabilizing the common european currency .
but capital markets remain skeptical .
the search for a remedy continues . in the eyes of many experts , the euro is still ailing .
but what they do n't know is whether it 's just a cold , which can be treated , or a terminal illness .
no one seems to have the right remedy .
that worries hans-olaf henkel , the former president of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- who also served as managing director of ibm deutschland : he believes the euro has failed and gives germany part of the blame .
" we have not complied with our own guidelines , which certainly would have made the euro a success , " henkel said .
together with the french government , he adds , the german government weakened the stability pact by breaching its criteria – " without an emergency , without a financial or economic crisis , and without a euro crisis . "
' greece isnt 't entirely to blame ' european parliamentarian elmar brok , a member of germany 's christian democratic union party , agrees that greece is n't entirely to blame for the euro mess .
" often the feeling in brussels is that if the big nations need to bend the rules , they change the rules , " brok said .
" but when the smaller nations try to bend the rules , they 're hung out to dry .
we need to make perfectly clear that we germans have a responsibility to restore trust in our own standing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bdi president hans-olaf henkel believes the euro has failed but the german government 's hesitant response to the crisis has shaken trust in the euro .
at the beginning of may , the european union agreed to a 750-billion-euro rescue package for the common currency – in a bid to calm turbulent financial markets .
after grinding its gears , the german government switched into the fast lane and approved 147 billion euros in aid .
andreas schmitz , president of the association of german banks , believes berlin moved too fast , however .
" if the money is already lying in front of you on the table , you grab it , " he said .
" a better idea is to dangle the money and be told that it 's all yours if you 're willing to accept certain conditions . "
european currency watchdogs observers agree the eu will have to live with its own mistakes as it searches for remedies to cure the ailing euro .
the european monetary fund , favored by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , has been sharply criticized by european currency watchdogs .
they fear such a fund would allow debt-ridden nations to pull back on their austerity efforts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts argue for giving the european commission greater economic control another idea making the rounds is the establishment of a european economic government .
france hatched the idea and , until recently , stood alone in its support .
then germany showed interest and , more recently , members of the eu summit in june backed the notion of a common economic policy .
if there is to be an agreement , christian calliess , a european affairs expert at berlin 's free university , expects member states will be willing to give the eu greater economic control rather than responsibility for drafting economic policy .
" i can imagine plenty of control options , like giving greater responsibilities to the european commission and other community bodies to oversee the budgets of member states , " calliess said .
tough action if there is a consensus in the eurozone today , it 's to combat not the symptoms but the causes of the euro 's illness .
that means getting a handle on government debt to halt speculation against the euro .
and that , says calliess , implies taking some tough action .
" in the event of an extreme case like greece , we need to have the possibility of allowing a country to file for insolvency in much the same way a company does in the private sector , " he said .
for sure , this could be a risky operation but it 's one that could prevent the euro from becoming a chronically ill , weak currency .

that worries hans-olaf henkel , the former president of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- who also served as managing director of ibm deutschland : he believes the euro has failed and gives germany part of the blame .
" we have not complied with our own guidelines , which certainly would have made the euro a success , " henkel said .
together with the french government , he adds , the german government weakened the stability pact by breaching its criteria – " without an emergency , without a financial or economic crisis , and without a euro crisis . "
' greece isnt 't entirely to blame ' european parliamentarian elmar brok , a member of germany 's christian democratic union party , agrees that greece is n't entirely to blame for the euro mess .
" often the feeling in brussels is that if the big nations need to bend the rules , they change the rules , " brok said .
" but when the smaller nations try to bend the rules , they 're hung out to dry .
we need to make perfectly clear that we germans have a responsibility to restore trust in our own standing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bdi president hans-olaf henkel believes the euro has failed but the german government 's hesitant response to the crisis has shaken trust in the euro .
at the beginning of may , the european union agreed to a 750-billion-euro rescue package for the common currency – in a bid to calm turbulent financial markets .
after grinding its gears , the german government switched into the fast lane and approved 147 billion euros in aid .
andreas schmitz , president of the association of german banks , believes berlin moved too fast , however .
" if the money is already lying in front of you on the table , you grab it , " he said .
" a better idea is to dangle the money and be told that it 's all yours if you 're willing to accept certain conditions . "
european currency watchdogs observers agree the eu will have to live with its own mistakes as it searches for remedies to cure the ailing euro .
the european monetary fund , favored by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , has been sharply criticized by european currency watchdogs .
they fear such a fund would allow debt-ridden nations to pull back on their austerity efforts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts argue for giving the european commission greater economic control another idea making the rounds is the establishment of a european economic government .
france hatched the idea and , until recently , stood alone in its support .
then germany showed interest and , more recently , members of the eu summit in june backed the notion of a common economic policy .
if there is to be an agreement , christian calliess , a european affairs expert at berlin 's free university , expects member states will be willing to give the eu greater economic control rather than responsibility for drafting economic policy .
" i can imagine plenty of control options , like giving greater responsibilities to the european commission and other community bodies to oversee the budgets of member states , " calliess said .
tough action if there is a consensus in the eurozone today , it 's to combat not the symptoms but the causes of the euro 's illness .
that means getting a handle on government debt to halt speculation against the euro .
and that , says calliess , implies taking some tough action .
" in the event of an extreme case like greece , we need to have the possibility of allowing a country to file for insolvency in much the same way a company does in the private sector , " he said .
for sure , this could be a risky operation but it 's one that could prevent the euro from becoming a chronically ill , weak currency .

many of germany 's public music schools are facing financial insecurity at a time of widespread spending cuts .
but teachers are still trying to uphold basic musical education for tomorrow 's talent . the toy donkey sitting in lea 's opened violin case at a music school in the western german city of duisburg is all ears .
eighteen beginners are bowing and plucking their string instruments , coached by music teacher joachim schaefer .
the ' violinos , ' duisburg 's junior ensemble , comes together once a week , viola and cello pupils included .
playing as a group enhances the individual tuition they each need to eventually master an instrument .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lea 's toy donkey listens in .
" that was pretty good , " schaefer tells his lively bunch of budding musicians , " but you can play it better !
always remember to play cleanly with your fingers on the a and d strings . "
he tests them on whether the melody is in a major or minor key .
" it does n't sound at all sweet , does it ?
" sour , " comes the reply .
" good ! "
waiting in the corridor is one of many parents , monika dick .
she 's thrilled by the violinos .
" they also give small concerts , so they learn how to perform in public .
this is an extra service of the teaching personnel .
it 's great . "
behind the scenes - deep uncertainty the educational vitality at the lower rhine music and art school is , however , deceptively endangered .
duisburg , a city of half-a-million residents , comprising 170 nationalities , once made its name with steel and coal . the city has now amassed debts of 2.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 billion -rrb- .
that is symptomatic of budgetary dilemmas facing many german municipalities - whether to keep or drop public services , from theaters to swimming pools .
many are in " intensive care " warns the german association of cities and towns , mainly because the recession has shrunk their share of tax revenues .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lena-aylen fine-tunes prokofiev melody with teacher ute steffens .
in march , duisburg 's city council rejected mayor adolf sauerland 's suggestion that the music school be privatised or outsourced after a public outcry .
parents like tanir aday , whose daughter learns the flute , are still worried about the fate of this decades-old public institution with 3,400 pupils and 110 tutors . " it does n't look so good , " he said .
" many parents and teachers have joined together in order to seek clarification of the situation , because it its so important .
making savings in the schools should be the very last option . "
wrangle over funding local authorities are historically the financial mainstays of germany 's 1,000 public music schools , where parents also pay fees for weekly lessons . overseeing a newly reformed nation-wide curricula is the german music schools federation , the vdm , which recently demanded that germany 's 16 regional states contribute far more funding and recognise that music schools are essential institutions and not just " nice to have " cultural entities vulnerable to austerities .
under germany 's constitution , the federal states have long had a big say in culture , which in german law subsumes education as well .
only in the former east germany does the regional state funding for local music schools approach 10 percent .
" in north rhine-westphalia , where the regional state only contributes 1.7 percent , the whole burden lies with the communal authorities , who 're finding it increasingly difficult , " said sybilla stachwitz , the federal chairperson of the parents ' branch of the vdm .
complicating the scene in north rhine-westphalia is jeki .
" every child , an instrument " is a special trust-funded initiative for 45,000 children .
music tutors visit more than 550 primary schools , teaching classes instead of giving individual lessons .
the concept is controversial among music educators but it 's seen by some as an answer to several challenges : how to ensure musical equality for all , including children from poorer families , and how to integrate musical tuition into all forms of schooling .
music schools , which traditionally open their doors after lunch , must now cope with the fact that many primary and secondary schools have extended their periods deep into the afternoons , in part to assist pupils ' working parents .
demise of music know-how lamented this drive toward integrative musical education follows warnings from renowned musicians such as opera singer edda moser , now a music professor in cologne .
she recently told german radio that too many children lack first-hand musical experience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : percussion teacher markus kreiger with sam schwarzer " that begins at home , with the parents singing with their children .
and , that does n't exist any more , unfortunately , because of the media usage , " she said .
" there 's a generation growing up that has hardly ever heard classical music , except for when it pops up in advertising , " adds markus kreiger , a trained symphonic percussionist who has taught for two decades at duisburg .
he offers lessons in timpani -lrb- orchestral kettledrum -rrb- and vibraphone .
" 99.5 percent only want to play the drums . "
cutbacks tempt cities to casualise employment in dueren , an hour 's drive past open-cast brown coal-mines from duisburg , a dozen teenage guitarists round off a public forum on the plight of music schools by performing a classical piece from the venezuelan composer alfonso montes . the forum was organised by the friends ' association of dueren 's music school to highlight the impact of cutbacks on teaching personnel and how the prevailing circumstances hamper pupil-teacher continuity .
more than half of dueren 's tutors are on so-called casual ' freelance ' contracts .
ten years ago the city of dueren , and many other cities , largely ceased to recruit music school teachers as salaried staff to save on costs .
" casuals are -lrb- seen -rrb- as cheaper and , for the administration , as the flexible alternative , " said podium chairperson , dr. gisela hagenau .
" but they do n't have any protection against dismissal .
they do n't have income during school vacations .
they are liable themselves for retirement arrangements .
they have n't had a fee raise for 10 years . "
dedication " exploited " conducting the young guitarists is christian ulrich , who lacks a salaried position despite his qualification as a music conservatory graduate .
" the everyday situation for us as casual teachers in dueren , or casual teachers generally , is that our dedication to the work that we do is exploited through the social necessity of us having to earn money .
therein lays our greatest dilemma .
i had never anticipated that this job would be so precarious . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speaking out in dueren : music teachers peter reiser -lrb- left -rrb- , ina hagenau and christian ulrich peter reiser , also a qualified guitar teacher , once taught members of the guitar ensemble in dueren .
he told deutsche welle that he got fed up with waiting years for his casual work to turn into employment .
instead , he left , when offered a salaried job as music school teacher in moenchengladbach .
gone are the days when people asked him , " what do you do for a real job ? "
he says he has job security , including pay for preparing lessons , attendances at staff conferences and school concerts , and , not least , recognition as " a person with a qualification . "
" because of the casual work situation , i often had to give up .
that was a painful experience for me and also for the pupils , " he said .
" when do children in our society have the opportunity to build such close relationships ?
when does an adult devote 30 or 45 minutes only to this child ?
that hardly happens , often not even in families . "
ulrich too says he was once asked by a pupil , " do you have enough money to eat ? "
" working with children gives me incredible enjoyment .
we believe , however , it ca n't remain like this , because you can not skimp in this area , " ulrich told deutsche welle .
" take the youth centers , take the music schools ; take the whole educational sector .
it 's unacceptable ! "
duisburg lobbys for its music school likewise in duisburg , parents and pupils remain determined to safeguard the financial viability of their communal music school .
teenage saxophonist leah lorke says " everyone is scared that it 's not going to be what it always was anymore .
it used to be ... it is still such a great school , and it 's not very expensive - great teachers and lots of kids . "
with her two sons , aged 6 and 10 , maria-teresa martin-lopez is even more insistent : " there are thousands of children here , and hundreds of teachers , who work here .
that would be a catastrophe if the children could n't come here any longer .
where would they go ?
they need this !
it 's important for the children that they learn to play at least one instrument ! "

in front of more than 1,000 cheering onlookers at a packed concert hall in the capital bishkek , otunbayeva somberly took her oath and promised a new political era for crisis-ridden kyrgyzstan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethnic violence has died down since erupting in april " as president , i will spare no effort to create a new political culture for the country based on a strict adherence to the rule of law , " she told the assembled crowd .
" i must be principled and consistently make demands on all branches of government to ensure it .
the new policy can not be built on fantasies and illusions .
it must be real and effective . "
inauguration comes at delicate moment otunbayeva takes over the government as kyrgyzstan has been wracked by violence and political instability .
thousands have died in ethnic violence between kyrgyz and uzbeks since then-president kurmanbek bakiyev was removed from power in a bloody coup in april .
at least 75,000 people fled to neighboring uzbekistan , leading international aid agencies to warn of an impending humanitarian crisis in dealing with the thousands of families left homeless .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dozens of thousands remain homeless in the south the inauguration comes just days after the country overwhelmingly approved a new constitution that will make kyrgyzstan the region 's first parliamentary democracy , a move the government hopes will bring a measure of stability .
the new constitution slashes the powers of the president and sets the stage for parliamentary elections that authorities have scheduled for early october to bring in a permanent government .
russian president dmitry medvedev , meanwhile , has questioned the feasibility of kyrgyzstan 's aspirations for a parliamentary democracy , warning that it could lead to further instability in the country and the region .
he said last week on the sidelines of the g20 summit in toronto that a lack of autocratic rule in kyrgyzstan could result in a " relapse into factionalism , " giving rise to a " breeding ground for islamist extremism . "

miroslav klose scored twice , along with goals from thomas mueller and defender arne friedrich . germany have scored four goals for the third time in the world cup , this time dispatching argentina with shocking ease in the quarterfinal .
" now we 're among the best four teams in the world , and that 's exactly where this team belongs , " coach joachim loew said after the game .
" our destiny is in our own hands now , we can achieve something really great here . "
bildunterschrift : coach joachim loew , center , had every reason to cheer as his side banged in four goals - again the germans got off to a flying start , scoring the quickest goal of the world cup this year against a shocked argentina backline , with thomas mueller heading home a free-kick in just the third minute .
the 20-year-old mueller , who was a two-goal hero against england in the previous round , has now scored four in the competition from his position on the right flank .
" it 's insane , after thrashing argentina 4-0 , i 'm almost lost for words , " mueller told reporters after the match .
" the star today , once again , was the team as a whole . "
mueller , however , will play no part in the semifinal .
the bayern munich man picked up his second yellow card of the competition from a handball call that was more than a bit questionable by the referee , meaning he will serve a one-match ban .
" i hope that my teammates get everything right in the semifnal , then i can come back and score another goal in the final , " the upbeat youngster concluded .
scorer turns provider despite this setback , mueller remained a key man going forward for joachim loew 's men , and displayed fantastic determination and awareness in the build up for germany 's second goal .
even after losing his footing , a seated mueller played a great through-ball for lukas podolski on the left wing , who delivered the perfect cross to miroslav klose in front of goal .
after argentine goalie sergio romero dived for the cross and missed , klose simply had to tap the ball into an open net .
moments later arne friedrich - pushing forward from the center of defense - put the finishing touches on a great cross from bastian schweinsteiger to make it 3-0 germany with just a quarter of an hour to play .
closing in on the record bildunterschrift : miroslav klose , left , only needs two more goals to become the world cup 's deadliest ever striker in the dying minutes , with argentina clearly broken , germany made it four , again through miroslav klose .
the veteran 's 100th game for his country could hardly have been scripted better .
with his second-half brace , the frontman grabbed his 13th and 14th career world cup goals , meaning he is now level with legendary striker gerd mueller as the most prolific german in world cup history .
he only needs one more to tie the overall record of 15 goals , held by the brazilian goal-machine ronaldo .
schweinsteiger shines holding midfielder bastian schweinsteiger , who has excelled while filling the boots of injured german captain michael ballack during the competition , was awarded man of the match for his performance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael who ?
schweinsteiger has replaced ballack in style schweinsteiger set up germany 's first and third goals , but his most crucial contribution was controlling the game in the middle of the park from start to finish .
" we may have to play spain next , " the man of the match cautioned after the victory .
" they 're the best team in the world , in my view .
but we 're good enough , we believe in ourselves . "
germany will now face either european champions spain or paraguay , who play on saturday evening , in the semifinals .

the gigantic eurozone rescue plan has succeeded , at least for now , in stabilizing the common european currency .
but capital markets remain skeptical .
the search for a remedy continues . in the eyes of many experts , the euro is still ailing .
but what they do n't know is whether it 's just a cold , which can be treated , or a terminal illness .
no one seems to have the right remedy .
that worries hans-olaf henkel , the former president of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- who also served as managing director of ibm deutschland : he believes the euro has failed and gives germany part of the blame .
" we have not complied with our own guidelines , which certainly would have made the euro a success , " henkel said .
together with the french government , he adds , the german government weakened the stability pact by breaching its criteria – " without an emergency , without a financial or economic crisis , and without a euro crisis . "
' greece isnt 't entirely to blame ' european parliamentarian elmar brok , a member of germany 's christian democratic union party , agrees that greece is n't entirely to blame for the euro mess .
" often the feeling in brussels is that if the big nations need to bend the rules , they change the rules , " brok said .
" but when the smaller nations try to bend the rules , they 're hung out to dry .
we need to make perfectly clear that we germans have a responsibility to restore trust in our own standing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bdi president hans-olaf henkel believes the euro has failed but the german government 's hesitant response to the crisis has shaken trust in the euro .
at the beginning of may , the european union agreed to a 750-billion-euro rescue package for the common currency – in a bid to calm turbulent financial markets .
after grinding its gears , the german government switched into the fast lane and approved 147 billion euros in aid .
andreas schmitz , president of the association of german banks , believes berlin moved too fast , however .
" if the money is already lying in front of you on the table , you grab it , " he said .
" a better idea is to dangle the money and be told that it 's all yours if you 're willing to accept certain conditions . "
european currency watchdogs observers agree the eu will have to live with its own mistakes as it searches for remedies to cure the ailing euro .
the european monetary fund , favored by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , has been sharply criticized by european currency watchdogs .
they fear such a fund would allow debt-ridden nations to pull back on their austerity efforts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts argue for giving the european commission greater economic control another idea making the rounds is the establishment of a european economic government .
france hatched the idea and , until recently , stood alone in its support .
then germany showed interest and , more recently , members of the eu summit in june backed the notion of a common economic policy .
if there is to be an agreement , christian calliess , a european affairs expert at berlin 's free university , expects member states will be willing to give the eu greater economic control rather than responsibility for drafting economic policy .
" i can imagine plenty of control options , like giving greater responsibilities to the european commission and other community bodies to oversee the budgets of member states , " calliess said .
tough action if there is a consensus in the eurozone today , it 's to combat not the symptoms but the causes of the euro 's illness .
that means getting a handle on government debt to halt speculation against the euro .
and that , says calliess , implies taking some tough action .
" in the event of an extreme case like greece , we need to have the possibility of allowing a country to file for insolvency in much the same way a company does in the private sector , " he said .
for sure , this could be a risky operation but it 's one that could prevent the euro from becoming a chronically ill , weak currency .

the gigantic eurozone rescue plan has succeeded , at least for now , in stabilizing the common european currency .
but capital markets remain skeptical .
the search for a remedy continues . in the eyes of many experts , the euro is still ailing .
but what they do n't know is whether it 's just a cold , which can be treated , or a terminal illness .
no one seems to have the right remedy .
that worries hans-olaf henkel , the former president of the federation of german industries -lrb- bdi -rrb- who also served as managing director of ibm deutschland : he believes the euro has failed and gives germany part of the blame .
" we have not complied with our own guidelines , which certainly would have made the euro a success , " henkel said .
together with the french government , he adds , the german government weakened the stability pact by breaching its criteria – " without an emergency , without a financial or economic crisis , and without a euro crisis . "
' greece isnt 't entirely to blame ' european parliamentarian elmar brok , a member of germany 's christian democratic union party , agrees that greece is n't entirely to blame for the euro mess .
" often the feeling in brussels is that if the big nations need to bend the rules , they change the rules , " brok said .
" but when the smaller nations try to bend the rules , they 're hung out to dry .
we need to make perfectly clear that we germans have a responsibility to restore trust in our own standing . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bdi president hans-olaf henkel believes the euro has failed but the german government 's hesitant response to the crisis has shaken trust in the euro .
at the beginning of may , the european union agreed to a 750-billion-euro rescue package for the common currency – in a bid to calm turbulent financial markets .
after grinding its gears , the german government switched into the fast lane and approved 147 billion euros in aid .
andreas schmitz , president of the association of german banks , believes berlin moved too fast , however .
" if the money is already lying in front of you on the table , you grab it , " he said .
" a better idea is to dangle the money and be told that it 's all yours if you 're willing to accept certain conditions . "
european currency watchdogs observers agree the eu will have to live with its own mistakes as it searches for remedies to cure the ailing euro .
the european monetary fund , favored by german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble , has been sharply criticized by european currency watchdogs .
they fear such a fund would allow debt-ridden nations to pull back on their austerity efforts .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some experts argue for giving the european commission greater economic control another idea making the rounds is the establishment of a european economic government .
france hatched the idea and , until recently , stood alone in its support .
then germany showed interest and , more recently , members of the eu summit in june backed the notion of a common economic policy .
if there is to be an agreement , christian calliess , a european affairs expert at berlin 's free university , expects member states will be willing to give the eu greater economic control rather than responsibility for drafting economic policy .
" i can imagine plenty of control options , like giving greater responsibilities to the european commission and other community bodies to oversee the budgets of member states , " calliess said .
tough action if there is a consensus in the eurozone today , it 's to combat not the symptoms but the causes of the euro 's illness .
that means getting a handle on government debt to halt speculation against the euro .
and that , says calliess , implies taking some tough action .
" in the event of an extreme case like greece , we need to have the possibility of allowing a country to file for insolvency in much the same way a company does in the private sector , " he said .
for sure , this could be a risky operation but it 's one that could prevent the euro from becoming a chronically ill , weak currency .

despite rises in police pay finding enough recruits is not easy every day inside the british military headquarters at lashkar gah , an elderly afghan gardener tends a remarkable garden .
he does not say much when i pass by , just nods good morning or good afternoon .
but he is there most of the day , working in the sweltering helmand heat .
for several years now , he has lovingly sown the seeds for the flowers , and watered and nurtured them , eventually coaxing luxuriant red , white and pink blooms out of the thin , sandy soil .
his garden is at the heart of the camp , an unlikely but powerful reminder of home and normality under the harsh glare of the afghan sun .
all around it are the usual sand-coloured tents and the gravelled car park nearby , where the heat-haze blurs the sharp metallic edges of the military vehicles .
but anyone taking that walk through the garden can be transported for a few brief minutes by the summer scent of mint and the buzz of insects taking the pollen .
on parade british soldiers are helping to train the afghan police force i had forgotten how much afghans love flowers until we went to see the latest police recruits graduate from the helmand police training centre .
after an eight-week course , they stood smartly to attention on the parade ground , while their british trainers watched .
as the recruits left for the police stations and spartan checkpoints where they will serve , some had hung painted hearts and flowers around their necks , smiling and posing for the cameras .
but nothing in the afghan garden seems to grow to a western clock and the afghans know that our patience is running out it was hard to imagine that the police , in too many places , are still very much part of the problem , often corrupt and addicted to drugs , their behaviour driving some into the arms of the taliban .
several policewomen had just graduated too .
we met them in a separate room at the headquarters .
one of them , islambibi , was a feisty woman , with a ready laugh .
she told me she had been married at 10 to a man who was 43 , and had had the first of her five children when she was just 15 .
i must have looked aghast , because the women simply laughed .
" we have our tradition , and our culture , " she told me .
one of her colleagues told me she had single-handedly squashed a would-be suicide bomber by throwing herself on top of him when he resisted arrest - a rather foolhardy thing to do , i thought , but apparently it worked .
afghanistan produces 92 % of the world 's opium islambibi told us she had joined the police to try to create a safer future for her children .
but her smile faded when i asked what security was like now .
the day before , insurgents had blown up a local bank on police payday .
" security is worse again , " she said .
the others nodded .
yet they seemed to accept that violence was simply something that ebbed and flowed here .
none of the women in this small stuffy room had known peace for very long in their lifetime .
roast chicken the next day we drove in an armoured vehicle to highway 601 , one of the main roads through helmand , sweat dripping from the british soldiers ' faces .
they are trying to make the roads more secure , because if people can move safely , that might just encourage some farmers to plant crops other than the opium poppy , one of the few things to grow well in this soil .
living , sleeping , eating and working in a sandy base by the road , british troops were helping the afghan police man to the checkpoints .
their presence seems to ensure the police do their job properly and do not take bribes or intimidate , at least not when the soldiers are watching .
an overloaded van passes by with a wedding party inside , children smiling and waving as the adults play celebratory drums .
another van , laden with disgruntled goats passes by , the driver looking nervously at the police .
right next to the small british base , where the heat has risen uncomfortably to the mid 50s , is the afghan police station , where the police chief invites us in for lunch .
for most of the recruits , this is just a job and it is about daily survival he has a tired face , perhaps from a lifetime of fighting .
but he produces a feast of roast chicken and salad , and we eat cross-legged , the plates laid out on a blanket on the floor .
" how long do british troops need to stay here ? "
i asked the colonel .
" for as long as we need their help , " he told me .
" we still do not have enough police , and they do not yet have enough weapons or ammunition . "
i ask what would happen if british and other nato troops left afghanistan soon .
the afghan colonel was unequivocal .
the bloodshed would start again , rival tribes would vie once more to be the most powerful .
it did not worry him that the man at the top of the coalition forces had changed .
whether gen mcchrystal or gen petraeus , that was up to the americans .
the main thing for him was the help their forces gave while the afghans themselves tried to sort out their rivalries and create a government that worked enough of the time .
unyielding soil we visited to another patrol base the next day , where afghan army recruits are being mentored by british forces .
" they are not there yet , the afghans , " one soldier told me .
for most of the recruits , this is just a job and it is about daily survival .
they have survived the wars that have raged throughout their lives , he said , and they just want to stay alive as long as they can , earn enough money for three bowls of rice a day , and at the end of their military service , go home to their families .
the soldier gestures towards the recruits .
some are good and the people here like them , but others do not even want to go out of the gate to go on patrol .
many british soldiers in afghanistan are based in southern helmand province i knew exactly how they felt .
the day before we came , a british soldier lost his legs to a taliban roadside bomb not far from here .
as we walked apprehensively on a path between the fields , i looked over at the young faces of the soldiers with us , british and afghan , and at the kit that weighed them down in the morning heat , sweat already soaking through their shirts and their heavy body armour .
it was with relief that we returned to the nearest british camp in nad ali .
it is built on the site of an old british fort , its crumbling clay walls all that remain of these soldiers ' great-great-grandfathers ' efforts .
the walls are a reminder that foreign armies have come and gone , and that the british have been here many times before .
this time , british soldiers are trying to turn this hot dusty province into something that has at least a chance to flourish .
they are trying hard to sow those seeds into stubborn , unyielding soil and nurture the results , eager to point out a few small green shoots just beginning to peek above the sand .
but nothing in the afghan garden seems to grow to a western clock and the afghans know that our patience is running out .
and they fear we may not be the constant gardeners they need .
